0,State : v. : Jason Nickerson. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Jason Nickerson (defendant or Nickerson), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction on four counts of first-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2, and one count of felony assault and battery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial, claiming that the state failed to prove that he was the perpetrator of these crimes. The defendant also argues that, in violation of his constitutional rights and Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial justice erred in denying the defendant’s motion to exclude the testimony of a forensic evidence analyst who testified at trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In June 2007, sixteen-year old Emma1 was living in a motel room in South Attleboro, Massachusetts, with her alcoholic parents and younger sister. The family had moved to the 1', 'To protect her privacy, the complainant has been given a pseudonym.', '-1- motel after Emma became involved in a physical altercation with a cousin, causing her family to leave the home they were sharing with Emma’s aunt and cousins. At the time, Emma had dropped out of high school, but was working to obtain a GED; she also worked part-time at a fast-food restaurant in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Emma was on probation at the time, with an 8 p.m. curfew that had been imposed by the Family Court as a result of her having been reported missing to the police several times.', 'Despite this curfew, however, on June 30, 2007, Emma’s mother drove her to a friend’s house near Miriam Hospital in Providence at around 10 p.m., with the understanding that she would return for her later that evening. Emma and her friend watched television, played video games, and smoked marijuana. After a few hours, Emma repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to contact her mother for the promised ride back to the motel. Receiving no response, Emma made the fateful decision to walk from Providence to South Attleboro.2', 'Emma had been walking on North Main Street toward Pawtucket for about ten minutes when a car pulled up beside her and the driver asked if she needed a ride. Emma described the driver as a dark-skinned male who was bald, between 6’2” and 6’4” tall, and weighed over two hundred pounds; she also noted the man’s pointy noise, a distinguishing feature that she “had never seen [on] a person of his [African-American] race.”', 'According to Emma, she was apprehensive about getting into the car with the stranger, and asked the man “[a]re you going to hurt me? Is everything going to be all right?” The man responded “[y]es, I’m not going to hurt you, everything will be all right.” Emma—discouraged by the long walk ahead of her—accepted what she thought to be “a nice gesture,” and got into the car. 2', 'Although she testified that “[i]t’s kind of ridiculous” to walk from Providence to South Attleboro, and that the trek would take a “few hours,” Emma admitted that she “didn’t have any other way to get there besides walk” and “[t]o me, it wasn’t serious because [walking] was something I did all the time to get to wherever I needed to go.”', '-2-', 'As they drove, the man asked her name, and Emma, deciding that her real name was none of his business, told him her name was Jasmine. He also asked if she smoked marijuana, and she disclosed that she had some with her. According to Emma, the man then drove to a parking lot in Pawtucket in order to smoke the marijuana; however, the presence of people nearby made the man uncomfortable and they left. The man then drove through a maze of side streets until Emma realized that the car was no longer traveling toward the motel.', 'When Emma voiced her concerns, the man explained that they were going to his house to smoke the marijuana.', 'The car, however, came to a stop in a small parking area—surrounded on three sides by a chain link fence—where the man tried to kiss Emma. When she resisted, the man forced her to kiss him; he bit her collarbone and began to pull off her pants. Emma testified that the man continuously hit her in the face as she struggled and tried to escape. According to Emma, the man began to penetrate her vagina with his fingers, and forced her to perform oral sex. She attempted to escape by crawling into the backseat, but the man climbed on top of her and penetrated her both vaginally and anally. Emma testified that as she tried to escape from the backseat the man choked her until she almost lost consciousness. Emma testified that, at one point during the attack, she felt a knife against her ribs and realized that resistance was futile. She stopped struggling and began pleading with the man to let her go.', 'When the ordeal ended, the man took a towel and wiped her thoroughly in the vaginal and anal areas where he had ejaculated. He took her cell phone from her purse and removed the battery; he gave Emma the phone, but refused to return her purse. The man started the car, at which point Emma noticed that it was almost 4 a.m. He then ordered Emma to get out of the car and lie face down on the ground, threatening to back the car over her if she looked at him, his vehicle, or his license plate. He also threatened to kill her and her family if she reported the', '-3- incident to police.', 'After the man drove away, Emma stood up and ran toward the street. A woman driving by asked Emma if she needed help, and offered her a ride. Emma accepted and told the woman what had happened to her; however, she refused the woman’s attempt to go to the police station, insisting that she go home to be with her family.3 When the woman was unable to find the motel where Emma’s family resided, she left Emma at a Walgreens store in Pawtucket with enough money to buy water. Emma was met there by Pawtucket Police Officer Richard LaForest (Det. LaForest),4 who was responding to a report—from a woman who went to the Pawtucket police station—suggesting that the police check on the well-being of an injured woman at Walgreens.5 Emma disclosed to Det. LaForest that she had been raped, and, despite Emma’s desire to return home, an ambulance was summoned to transport her to Hasbro Children’s Hospital.', 'At the hospital, Emma was seen by Dr. Amy Goldberg (Dr. Goldberg), a specialist in child abuse pediatrics. According to Dr. Goldberg, it was immediately apparent that Emma “had very obvious physical trauma,” to her face and neck; Emma’s left eye was swollen shut, there was a cut on her mouth, and her neck was red and swollen. Emma told Dr. Goldberg that she had been physically and sexually assaulted by a man who penetrated her vaginally, anally, and orally over a period of about three hours, and explained that when she tried to resist, her assailant punched her in the face and body, and he bit her and choked her almost to the point of unconsciousness. 3', 'Despite her unstable home environment, Emma testified that following the attack she just wanted to be at home with her family, craving “some sense of closeness” in the aftermath of her ordeal. 4', 'At the time of the incident, Det. LaForest held the rank of patrolman. 5', 'The woman who picked up Emma and presumably reported the incident to the Pawtucket police was never identified.', '-4-', 'Doctor Goldberg testified that her examination was consistent with Emma’s description of the assault; it revealed extensive bruising and petechial hemorrhaging—which occurs when vessels in the skin release blood due to pressure or trauma—on Emma’s face. Doctor Goldberg testified that the pervasive petechial hemorrhaging around Emma’s eyes and neck corroborated the girl’s account of being choked. Additional petechial hemorrhaging was evident on Emma’s back, and Dr. Goldberg noted bruising and “suction” injuries on Emma’s chest, consistent with Emma’s claim of having been bitten by the assailant. According to Dr. Goldberg, all of Emma’s injuries were recently inflicted.6', 'Doctor Goldberg also conducted a genital examination, noting that except for the area outside of her vagina, which exhibited erythema, or extreme redness, the examination was normal. Doctor Goldberg explained that erythema was consistent with trauma; however, she noted that there was no bleeding, tearing, fissures, or other acute signs of traumatic injury to the vaginal or anal areas. According to Dr. Goldberg, such observations did not conflict with Emma’s account of having been sexually assaulted, because girls of Emma’s age are “fully estrogenized,” which makes vaginal tissue “extremely lubricated, thick and flexible.” It is for this reason, Dr. Goldberg clarified, that outward signs of genital trauma are uncommon and exhibited in no more than 5 to 10 percent of sexual assault cases. The doctor further explained that signs of damage to the anal cavity are even more rare, with no physical manifestations in more than 99 percent of sexual assaults involving anal penetration.', 'Doctor Goldberg also collected various biologic samples to include in a forensic evidence 6', 'Doctor Goldberg testified that although she photographed Emma’s injuries during the examination conducted in the early morning hours of July 1, 2007, those photographs were unavailable at trial due to a technical computer issue. During her testimony, Dr. Goldberg instead referenced photographs taken during Emma’s follow-up examination on July 2. Doctor Goldberg, however, testified that during the initial examination, Emma’s injuries appeared “much more severe” than what was depicted in the photographs admitted into evidence.', '-5- collection kit, including swab samples from inside Emma’s mouth, vagina, and rectum. Emma’s clothes were collected and placed into a bag, except for her underwear, which was placed in a separate bag. The forensic evidence kit was later examined by Sharon Mallard (Mallard), a forensic scientist at the Rhode Island Department of Health Laboratory. Mallard noted five visible stains on the underwear, and further testing of the garment revealed the presence of sperm. A small amount of sperm also was detected on both the vaginal and rectal slides, which were created by swiping the corresponding swab across a single slide.7', 'The evidence kit was then sent for DNA testing to ReliaGene Technologies lab in New Orleans, Louisiana, where it was tested by forensic DNA analyst Teresa-Lynne Jones (Jones). A cutting from Emma’s underwear confirmed the presence of sperm cells and yielded a DNA profile from a single, unknown male. The swabs and slides contained in the evidence kit were not tested for DNA, and it was only the biological material from Emma’s underwear that Jones used to develop the DNA profile. This DNA profile, developed solely from testing conducted on the underwear, was submitted to the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) on November 19, 2007, but there were no matches with anyone registered in the system at that time. Notably, a cutting from Emma’s underwear was the only clothing submitted to ReliaGene for testing. The other garments that Emma was wearing were transferred from the Department of Health to the Providence Police Department, where it subsequently was lost after an evidence viewing session by defense counsel and a paralegal from the Office of the Attorney General.8 7', 'Mallard testified that, because the slides and underwear revealed the presence of sperm, the other articles of clothing that Emma was wearing at the time of the attack were not tested. She explained that this was according to protocol; had the results from the samples in the evidence kit come back negative, further testing would have been conducted. 8', 'Detective John Muriel, who examined the garments before they went missing, later testified that he did not notice any obvious damage to the clothing, such as tears or bloodstains.', '-6-', 'The police investigation conducted after the assault also produced no leads. On July 2, 2007—the day after the incident—Providence Police Det. John Muriel (Det. Muriel) interviewed Emma.', 'Detective Muriel drove with Emma through various neighborhoods in Providence attempting to locate the crime scene, without success. Emma also was shown a photo array of six photographs, but was unable to identify any of the men as her attacker. One week later, Emma and Det. Muriel again drove around various neighborhoods in Providence, and this time Emma was able to identify a parking lot near Cranston Street as the location where the attack occurred. Detective Muriel’s attempts to speak with any occupants of the homes adjoining the lot were unsuccessful.', 'Time passed. In July 2009—two years after the attack—Det. Muriel showed Emma a second photo array; again, she was unable to identify any of the subjects as her attacker. In January 2011, the Providence police were notified that there was a match between the DNA sample produced from Emma’s evidence kit and a DNA profile recently submitted to CODIS. The suspect was identified as Jason Nickerson (Nickerson or defendant). Upon receiving this information, Det. Muriel attempted to locate Emma, and on March 9, 2011—almost four years after the attack—Det. Muriel showed Emma yet another photo array, this time containing a picture of Nickerson. However, Emma did not identify any of the men in the photo array.', 'Detective Muriel proceeded to obtain a search warrant and perform a buccal swab on Nickerson, who was being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) on an unrelated charge.', 'Detective Muriel delivered the swab to the Rhode Island Department of Health laboratories, where Cara Lupino (Lupino), supervisor of forensic biology and DNA laboratories, tested the sample. In accordance with the lab’s protocol, Lupino first retested the original sample that was taken from the forensic evidence kit, and obtained the same result. Next,', '-7- Lupino tested the buccal swab obtained from Nickerson pursuant to the search warrant. After comparing the two samples, Lupino concluded that the profile developed from the sample taken from Emma’s underwear matched the profile developed from Nickerson’s buccal swab to a probable certainty of one in 5.6 quadrillion people, which Lupino explained was one in a million times the earth’s population.', 'Nickerson subsequently was indicted on seven felony counts, including four counts of first-degree sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-2, consisting of penile-vaginal penetration (count 1), digital-vaginal penetration (count 2), penile-anal penetration (count 3), and fellatio (count 4). Nickerson was also charged with assault with a dangerous weapon—namely, choking with hands—in violation of § 11-5-2 (count 5); second-degree robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1 (count 6); and assault with a dangerous weapon—a knife—in violation of § 11-5-2 (count 7).', 'A jury trial commenced on April 2, 2012. At trial, Nickerson testified on his own behalf and gave a widely divergent account of his encounter with Emma. Nickerson admitted that he had sexual relations with Emma; however, he claimed that it was a consensual encounter that did not occur on the day that Emma was brutally attacked. According to Nickerson, on a weekday afternoon the week before the assault, he was driving on Main Street in Pawtucket—in an area he claimed is known for prostitution—when he saw a young woman dressed in tight-fitting, provocative clothing. Assuming the woman was a prostitute, Nickerson testified that he stopped and asked the woman how she was doing, and told her that she looked cute. Nickerson testified that the woman leaned into the car and told him that she was looking to make some money. Nickerson, who testified that he had engaged the services of a prostitute on at least two previous', '-8- occasions, invited the woman into the car.9', 'Nickerson claimed that after driving for two to three minutes, he drove into an alley, where the woman told him her name was either Jackie or Jasmine and that it would cost $20 for oral sex or $60 for vaginal intercourse. Nickerson testified that he paid the woman $60, at which point he moved to the backseat of the vehicle and the woman climbed over the front seat into the backseat, and proceeded to unbutton and unzip his pants. He testified that she then performed oral sex for approximately five minutes.10 Nickerson testified that the woman then removed her pants and underpants, and the two engaged in vaginal intercourse while they both faced the rear passenger side window. Nickerson claimed that after about fifteen minutes he ejaculated onto her lower back, at which point he pulled up his pants and returned to the front seat. He retrieved the woman’s purse from the floor in front of the passenger seat and handed it to her. He testified that the woman removed “a white cottonish thing” from her bag, and wiped her back before she dressed and exited the car. According to Nickerson, he did not penetrate the woman anally or digitally, nor did he hit, bite, choke, or otherwise harm her.', 'Although Nickerson acknowledged that he had a sexual encounter with Emma on a day earlier in the week that she was assaulted, he insisted that it could not have been on June 30, the night that she was brutally attacked. Nickerson—who had been adopted as a child after spending years in foster care—testified that he spent that entire day preparing to attend a long-awaited family reunion on Sunday, July 1, 2007, where he was to meet many of his relatives for the first 9', 'Although defendant admitted to using the services of a prostitute “about three times” in the past, on cross-examination he could not recount in any detail where these transactions occurred, how much he had paid, or what services he received—in stark contrast to the detailed account of his encounter with Emma. 10', 'When asked on cross-examination about the discrepancy in his testimony regarding the quoted price of services, what he paid, and what services he received, defendant explained that it was all according to a “code” that prostitutes frequently use.', '-9- time. According to Nickerson, he spent all of June 30 shopping and preparing for the family barbecue. He claimed that he picked up his mother-in-law, Yula Walker (Walker), who spent the night at Nickerson’s home.', 'He further testified that at around 10 p.m., his cousin Derek Richardson (Richardson) arrived and the two played video games until around 2 a.m., at which point Nickerson went to bed.', 'One month before trial, defense counsel disclosed that Nickerson intended to rely on an alibi defense.', 'Defense counsel indicated that Walker and Richardson could be called to corroborate Nickerson’s claim that he spent the entire evening of June 30 into July 1 at home with his relatives—a location that was approximately half a mile from the house that Emma visited that evening. Significantly, although both Walker and Richardson had given this account to the state’s investigators prior to trial, after the trial commenced and after she spoke to Richardson, Walker changed her version of the events and claimed that she was mistaken about the address at which the family gathered. Walker recalled that the family actually had spent that evening with Nickerson at a different address in Pawtucket, approximately one mile from defendant’s home. Faced with this development, the prosecutor argued that the notice of alibi was fatally flawed; defense counsel, however, assured the court that no alibi witness would be called to testify in a manner inconsistent with the information provided in the original alibi notice, which referenced defendant’s home as the place where the family spent the evening. Consequently, although Nickerson testified that he was home that evening, and the trial justice did not preclude the defense from calling any witness, neither Walker nor Richardson testified about defendant’s purported alibi.', 'Instead, Nickerson testified in his own defense and maintained that, although he had sex with Emma earlier in the week, it was consensual and that the injuries she suffered on June 30 were consistent with having been in a fight, and not the', '- 10 - victim of a sexual attack.', 'On April 11, 2012, the jury found Nickerson guilty on five counts in the indictment, and he was acquitted on count 6—second-degree robbery—and count 7—assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a knife. On June 4, 2012, the trial justice heard and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice sentenced Nickerson to concurrent terms of sixty years at the ACI, with fifty years to serve and ten years suspended with probation. Concerning count 5, the trial justice sentenced defendant to twenty years to serve concurrently with the sentence imposed on the first four counts.11 The defendant timely appealed to this Court.', 'Analysis', 'Alleged Rule 16 and Brady Violations', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to exclude the testimony of Sharon Mallard, the analyst from the Department of Health, based on an alleged violation of defendant’s constitutional rights and his right to discovery in accordance with Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant bases this argument on the fact that Mallard’s handwritten bench notes, taken during her examination of Emma’s forensic evidence kit, were not disclosed to defense counsel until trial had commenced. The defendant claims that this evidence was material and favorable, and was withheld in violation of Nickerson’s constitutional right to due process and the state’s discovery obligation under Rule 16. The state denies that a due process violation occurred because, the state contends, the content of Mallard’s notes was neither exculpatory nor material. The state also argues that defendant’s reliance on Rule 16 is misplaced, because Nickerson failed to show bad faith on the part of the prosecutor or show that he was prejudiced by the late disclosure of information 11', 'Nickerson was also ordered to have no contact with Emma, register as a sex offender, undergo sex offender and anger management counseling, and to participate in substance abuse treatment.', '- 11 - contained in Mallard’s bench notes.', 'Under Rhode Island law, a criminal defendant may obtain pretrial discovery pursuant to Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.12', 'This Court previously has explained that the “overarching purpose” of Rule 16 is “to ensure that criminal trials are fundamentally fair.” State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 754 (R.I. 2005)). In fact, “[t]he primary purposes of the rule are to eliminate surprise at trial and ‘to ensure that both parties receive the fullest possible presentation of the facts prior to trial.’” State v. Garcia, 643 A.2d 180, 186 (R.I. 1994) (quoting State v. Concannon, 457 A.2d 1350, 1353 (R.I. 1983)).', 'In determining whether a Rule 16 violation has occurred, a trial justice should consider “(1) the reason for nondisclosure, (2) the extent of prejudice to the opposing party, (3) the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and (4) any other relevant factors.” State v. Stravato, 935 A.2d 948, 951 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Coelho, 454 A.2d 241, 245 (R.I. 1982)). If, however, the state deliberately failed to disclose evidence, “the defendant is entitled to a new trial, and no inquiry is needed into the presence of the other three factors.” McManus, 941 A.2d at 229 (quoting Stravato, 935 A.2d at 951). Otherwise, it is within the sound discretion of the trial justice to “determine whether any harm has resulted from noncompliance with 12', 'In pertinent part, Rule 16(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:', '“Discovery by Defendant. Upon written request by a defendant,', 'the attorney for the State shall permit the defendant to inspect or', 'listen to and copy or photograph any of the following items within', 'the possession, custody, or control of the State, the existence of', 'which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become', 'known to the attorney for the State:', '“* * *', '“(5) all results or reports in writing, or copies thereof, of', 'physical or mental examinations, and of scientific tests or', 'experiments made in connection with a particular case * * * .”', '- 12 - discovery motions, and whether the harm can be mitigated.” Briggs, 886 A.2d at 757 (quoting Coelho, 454 A.2d at 244-45).', 'In addition to Rule 16, “the due process clause of the United States Constitution requires that the state provide a criminal defendant with certain information.” McManus, 941 A.2d at 229 (citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963)). “In accordance with Brady, if a prosecutor has suppressed evidence that would be favorable to the accused and the evidence is material to guilt or punishment, the defendant’s due-process rights have been violated and a new trial must be granted.” DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 570 (R.I. 2011) (quoting McManus, 941 A.2d at 229-30). The Brady doctrine, however, “has its limits and does not ‘extend an open invitation to criminal defendants to comb prosecution files for any or all information that might be remotely useful.’” Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 880 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Wyche, 518 A.2d 907, 908 (R.I. 1986)). Any nondisclosed information subject to Brady must “be material in the sense that its ‘high value to the defense could not have escaped * * * [the prosecution’s] attention.’” Id. (quoting Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910). A defendant, therefore, has the burden of showing that “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” State v. Burnham, 58 A.3d 889, 900 (R.I. 2013) (quoting McManus, 941 A.2d at 230).', 'Notably, however, the prosecution cannot be held responsible “for delivering information that is not within its custody or control.” Id.

(quoting State v. Brisson, 619 A.2d 1099, 1102 (R.I. 1993)).', 'In the case at bar, the record reflects that, prior to trial, the prosecution complied with defendant’s initial discovery request by providing Mallard’s report of her analytical findings concerning the testing performed on the forensic evidence kit, and by informing the defense that Mallard would testify as to her conclusions regarding the report in order to establish that the evidence kit traveled along an unbroken chain of custody.', 'Mallard’s report, detailing her conclusions, was entered into evidence as exhibit No. 22. Before Mallard was called to testify on the afternoon of April 3, 2012, however, she provided the prosecutor with three pages of handwritten bench notes that were created while performing testing on the evidence kit. The prosecutor immediately gave the notes to defense counsel, who then moved to preclude Mallard from testifying as to her findings because of the late disclosure of the notes. Alternatively, defense counsel requested an overnight continuance to review the content of the notes, which consisted of shorthand markings and sketches, for “potentially exculpatory information contained therein.” The trial justice reserved ruling on the motion to exclude the evidence, but she granted the requested recess to allow counsel to review the notes.', 'When trial commenced the following morning, the defense renewed its motion to preclude Mallard from testifying as to her findings.', 'Counsel acknowledged that she had reviewed the notes with Mallard the previous afternoon, but contended that, based on the late disclosure, defendant was deprived of an opportunity to thoroughly explore what could potentially be exculpatory evidence with an expert in forensic pathology. Defense counsel maintained that, upon reviewing Mallard’s notes, she determined that the samples played a role in the defense’s case and that she felt the need to hire an expert. Defense counsel argued that,', '- 14 - based on defendant’s account that he had sex with Emma the week before she was attacked, the relatively small quantity of sperm found by Mallard on the slides and smears was probative as to when the sperm was deposited, and thus the late disclosure and alleged inability to consult an expert witness deprived defendant of a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine Mallard concerning the test results.', 'The prosecution responded that the state had been unaware of Mallard’s bench notes, and had turned them over to the defense immediately upon receiving them. Moreover, the state argued that defense counsel had notice that Mallard would be called to testify, and was provided with the document containing the summary of her analytical findings, marked as exhibit No. 22, which noted that a “[m]icroscopic examination revealed the presence of spermatozoa and/or partially intact spermatozoa on the vaginal and rectal samples,” as well as on Emma’s underwear—from which the DNA sample was developed.', 'The prosecutor acknowledged defendant’s right to cross-examine Mallard concerning the age and quantity of the sperm discovered on the tested samples, and noted that Mallard was being called for chain of custody purposes—to “show the integrity of the DNA that went all the way to ReliaGene”—where the DNA testing actually occurred. The state contended that the defense’s argument was without merit, because the defense was well aware that “this case comes down to DNA,” but at no time had defendant sought to hire his own experts to either retest the evidence or analyze the conclusions of any witness.', 'As a result, the prosecution argued that Nickerson was not prejudiced by the late disclosure of Mallard’s notes.', 'After hearing the parties’ arguments, the trial justice determined that there was no evidence that Mallard’s notes—marked exhibit No. 30 for identification—were purposely withheld from the defense.', 'The trial justice further noted that, although the defense was', '- 15 - provided with the summary of Mallard’s findings as to the presence of spermatozoa on the samples, the defense failed to seek production of notes or documents relating to the report or to pursue any independent investigation of the DNA evidence. The trial justice indicated that she had granted a continuance to permit counsel to review the notes with the witness. The trial justice also stated that the defense could have hired an expert to analyze Mallard’s findings and had failed to do so. The trial justice declared that she “d[id] not believe that the mere failure to produce the underlying notes to their report preclude[d] the defense from retaining an expert in order to properly meet even the findings of Ms. Mallard contained within that report.” As such, the trial justice determined that defense counsel’s position was “really a strategic argument,” and that defendant was not prejudiced by the late production of the bench notes, because defense counsel “could have inquired into these matters further with a consulting expert if it so desired.”', 'Reviewing this ruling through our deferential lens, we are satisfied that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis in accordance with Rule 16, by first determining that the state’s failure to produce Mallard’s notes was inadvertent, and then concluding that Nickerson suffered no prejudice by the “mere failure to produce the underlying notes,” because defendant was in possession of Mallard’s conclusions as set forth in her report—which, we note, did not deviate from her bench notes—and had ample opportunity to further investigate those findings. In fact, defendant was aware that this case hinged on the outcome of forensic testing, because Emma was never able to identify her assailant. We also note that defendant only sought to exclude Mallard’s testimony and did not move for a mistrial. Accordingly, we are unpersuaded by defendant’s argument that he was prejudiced by the late disclosure of Mallard’s bench notes, and we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in finding that Rule 16 had not been violated in the context of this case.', '- 16 -', 'Moreover, we are equally satisfied that the trial justice correctly found that a Brady violation did not occur in this case. When addressing this facet of defendant’s argument,13 the trial justice observed that the defense did not ask to pass the case based on the alleged late disclosure. The trial justice declared that she was convinced that defendant had notice of Mallard’s conclusions—and what would be testified to—in advance of trial. The trial justice determined that, not only was the defense able to address Mallard’s conclusions at trial, but “in fact, exploited that evidence during the course of trial as well,” by eliciting from Mallard that it was impossible to determine the age of the sperm or when it was deposited on Emma’s underwear, and that, despite the samples tested by Mallard, the only evidence that incriminated Nickerson was discovered by DNA testing conducted on the underwear cutting by another witness. For these reasons, the trial justice determined that further investigation of Mallard’s bench notes would not have changed the result of the proceeding. Accordingly, because we are satisfied that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis, we decline to disturb this finding on appeal. See Burnham, 58 A.3d at 900 (the defendant has the burden of showing that “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different”) (quoting McManus, 941 A.2d at 230). 13', 'When defendant’s argument regarding the alleged Brady violation was initially raised—prior to Mallard testifying as to her conclusions—the trial justice did not address it as such, and instead focused her ruling on defendant’s argument that Rule 16 had been violated.

The defendant also argues that the trial justice incorrectly denied his motion for a new trial based on the aforementioned alleged violations of Rule 16 and defendant’s constitutional rights resulting from the disclosure of Mallard’s technical notes at trial.', 'It is well settled that “[i]n reviewing a challenge to a trial justice’s rulings on a motion for judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial, this Court ‘first conducts a review of the new- trial motion.’” State v.

In making this determination, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” Id.', '- 18 - (quoting Staffier, 21 A.3d at 290). This undertaking requires the trial justice to “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013)). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1127 (quoting State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 472 (R.I. 2002)). Furthermore, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 967 (R.I. 2005)). We employ such a “deferential standard of review because ‘a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” Baptista, 79 A.3d at 29-30 (quoting Paola, 59 A.3d at 104).', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice declared that defendant’s motion for a new trial “asks this [c]ourt principally to determine whether the weight and credibility of the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict in this case.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to thoroughly detail all of the evidence and testimony presented at trial, noting that Emma’s testimony “was very credible.” The trial justice recounted that although the defense had the opportunity to vigorously cross-examine her, Emma gave her account of the assault “in measured tones,” and “completely dispelled” any notion that the attack was fabricated. In fact, the trial justice found that after the assault, Emma’s description of what transpired never wavered, and that the state “effectively corroborated” Emma’s account with the testimony of others who saw', '- 19 - her in the immediate aftermath of the assault.', 'The trial justice specifically recounted the “credible” testimony of Dr. Goldberg, noting that the doctor’s conclusions supported the physical and sexual assaults testified to by Emma, and discounted defendant’s assertion that Emma’s injuries were more consistent with having had been in a fight than the victim of a sexual assault. The trial justice detailed that the forensic testing conducted on the samples taken by Dr. Goldberg corroborated Emma’s story, and specified that she saw no issues with the forensic evidence in the case, declaring “that there was no break in the chain of custody and no evidence of contamination such that the results of that testing and the match reference w[ere] accurate and reliable evidence for the jury to depend upon.”', 'The trial justice also found that the photographs and evidence presented at trial corroborated Emma’s account of the attack.', 'The trial justice specifically discounted the defense’s criticism of Emma’s clothing having been lost; she noted that the defense had the opportunity to photograph the clothing before it went missing, and that, because there was no forensic testing conducted on the clothing, there was no loss of evidence “of any evidentiary significance.” The trial justice concluded that, “[c]onsidering the credible trial testimony of [Emma] and the corroborative physical evidence and other testimonial evidence,” she was satisfied that the jury reached the correct verdict.', 'The trial justice also stated that she was “satisfied that the [s]tate proved the identity of the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt.” The trial justice detailed that, although Emma had given an accurate description of her assailant to Det. Muriel, defendant’s true identity could not be established before 2011—when his DNA was entered into CODIS—because she did not know him and had never seen him before the attack. The trial justice commented that, in her', '- 20 - opinion, there were no photos of anyone resembling Nickerson in the first two photo arrays shown to Emma, and further, although Nickerson matched Emma’s initial description of her attacker, Emma could not be faulted for failing to identify him in the final photo array that contained his photograph.14 The trial justice concluded that the forensic evidence presented at trial “squared” with Emma’s account of the assault, and, with her testimony and the other evidence presented, “establish the defendant as the perpetrator of the sexual and physical assaults beyond a reasonable doubt.”', 'The trial justice also commented on defendant’s defense of consent and alibi, describing it as “perfect.” However, she noted that the jury rejected this defense “wholeheartedly,” and with “good reason to do so.” The trial justice explained that “defendant’s story [was] engineered [and] self-serving[,] was not corroborated[,] and lacked credibility.” She further detailed that Nickerson’s testimony “was too carefully contrived to explain away the physical evidence and take advantage of other evidence,” and noted that, on cross-examination, defendant “had difficulty sticking to his story.” After a thorough recitation of Nickerson’s testimony, the trial justice concluded that “the jury was within its rights and indeed correct to reject the defendant’s testimony.” The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial based on insufficient evidence, and also denied—citing the analysis of her previous rulings—defendant’s motion for a new trial based on alleged errors occurring at trial.', 'After careful review of the record before us, this Court is satisfied that the trial justice correctly addressed defendant’s motion for a new trial and, based on her reasoning and thorough review of the evidence in this case, we refuse to disturb the trial justice’s decision. The trial justice independently assessed the credibility of each witness and commented upon the weight of 14', 'The trial justice, after closely examining the photo, explained that “it was not readily apparent to the [c]ourt which picture was his even with the defendant in court sitting feet away.”', '- 21 - the evidence before agreeing with the jury verdict. We also discern no error with respect to the trial justice’s conclusion that the state effectively established an unbroken chain of custody of the evidence that was tested for, and found to contain, defendant’s DNA. Moreover, we are satisfied with the trial justice’s analysis regarding defendant’s claim of Rule 16 and Brady violations, and are of the opinion that she correctly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial on these grounds. Accordingly, based on our review of the record before us, we conclude that the trial justice did not err when she rejected defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Turning now to defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, “it is well settled that when passing on ‘a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.’” Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1128 (quoting State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013)). Thus, “[a] motion for a judgment of acquittal should be granted only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 1128-29 (quoting Long, 61 A.3d at 445). “If, however, a reasonable juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion should be denied.” Id. at 1129 (quoting Long, 61 A.3d at 445).', 'In this case, the trial justice denied the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s case after a detailed recitation of the evidence and witness testimony that had been presented up to that point. The trial justice unequivocally determined that, in addition to other testimony and evidence presented, Emma’s testimony alone was sufficient to support all counts of the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. Addressing the defendant’s argument that the chain of custody was flawed, the trial justice recounted the travel of the evidence tested, concluding that it had been properly collected and transported, and specified that there was no indication of a break in the chain of custody of the underwear “sufficient to undermine its', '- 22 - reliability.”15 When the defendant renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, the trial justice—citing to the same reasoning—denied this motion as well. Because we conclude that the trial justice’s decision is without error, any further analysis of the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal is unnecessary in light of our analysis and opinion regarding the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1127 (noting that, when faced with a challenge to rulings on both a motion for a new trial and for judgment of acquittal, this Court first conducts “the more exacting analysis required for review of a ruling on a motion for a new trial”) (quoting Gaffney, 63 A.3d at 893). Accordingly, we see no reason to disturb the trial justice’s decision regarding the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we deny and dismiss the defendant’s appeal and affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction. The papers in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. 15', 'Although defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in disregarding a purported missing link in the chain of custody of the underwear—namely, why it took so long for the samples to be tested and who transported the evidence kit from the hospital to the Department of Health—we are satisfied that the trial justice addressed this contention during her rulings on defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for a new trial, determining that there was no indication that the evidence had been tampered with or contaminated. To the extent that defendant posits this as a separate argument on appeal, we are equally satisfied that the trial justice did not err in finding that the state had established that the evidence had not been disturbed. See State v. Nelson, 982 A.2d 602, 612 (R.I. 2009) (noting that a showing of a continuous chain of custody is not necessary and that the state need not eliminate all possibility of tampering, but rather that evidence may be admitted upon a showing that “in all reasonable probability the evidence has not been subjected to tampering”) (citing State v.

The mortgage identified plaintiffs as “Borrowers,” Loancity as “Lender,” and MERS as “a separate corporation that is acting solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns.” The mortgage provided that the borrower “does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS” the property.

On July 11, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) of the United States Department of the Treasury closed IndyMac and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver.

Thus, as of November 4, 2009, Deutsche Bank held both the note and the mortgage to the property.', 'Subsequently, plaintiffs failed to make the required payments in accordance with the terms of the note. At least thirty days prior to March 4, 2010, OneWest—under power of attorney for Deutsche Bank—mailed notice to plaintiffs that a foreclosure sale on the property was scheduled for March 25, 2010. In addition, the foreclosure sale was advertised in the Providence Journal. As scheduled, Deutsche Bank foreclosed on March 25, 2010, and purchased the property at the foreclosure sale for $95,066.40.

Specifically, plaintiffs argue that they were not given proper notice of the trial justice’s intention to convert the motion to one for summary judgment or an opportunity to present additional evidence in accordance with Rule 56. Based on our review of the record in this case, we reject this argument.', '“A Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings provides a trial court with the means of disposing of a case early in the litigation process when the material facts are not in dispute after the pleadings have been closed and only questions of law remain to be decided.” Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 847 (R.I. 1992). However, Rule 12(c) specifically provides that,', '“[i]f, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside', 'the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the', 'motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed', 'of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable', 'opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion', 'by Rule 56.”', 'In the case at bar, the record reveals that both parties filed voluminous supplemental materials for the Superior Court justice to consider when deciding the motion for judgment on the pleadings. We note that it was plaintiffs who initially presented materials outside of the pleadings when defending against defendants’ Rule 12(c) motion, and who continued to file a plethora of materials that the Superior Court justice considered—in an exercise of his sound discretion—and which led him to convert defendants’ motion into a Rule 56 motion. Thus, a party that first introduces, and continues to supply, the materials that serve as a catalyst for conversion in accordance with Rule 12(c) cannot then complain about lack of notice. See Ouimette v. Moran, 541 A.2d 855, 856 (R.I. 1988) (“In view of the fact that [plaintiff] clearly encouraged the trial justice to consider matters outside the scope of the complaint, he cannot now be heard to argue that the trial justice acted improperly in considering the motion as one for', '-5- summary judgment.”). Accordingly, we are satisfied that plaintiffs were not denied notice or the opportunity to present additional material when the Superior Court justice properly converted defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings to one for summary judgment.', 'Grant of Summary Judgment', 'The plaintiffs next argue that the trial justice erred when he determined that no genuine issues of material fact existed and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Additionally, plaintiffs argue that the foreclosure sale was not lawfully noticed and conducted. Finally, plaintiffs claim that the Superior Court justice impermissibly relied upon previously decided Superior Court cases in making his decision in this case.', 'It is well settled that “[t]his Court reviews a trial court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.” Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 532 (R.I. 2013) (citing Swain v. Estate of Tyre, 57 A.3d 283, 288 (R.I. 2012)). In so doing, we apply the same standard as the trial justice and “view[] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Id. (citing Beauregard v. Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 493 (R.I. 2013)). “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Swain, 57 A.3d at 288). “[T]he nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id. (quoting Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013)). Moreover, we have unequivocally stated that “we will not hesitate to affirm a grant of summary judgment if the nonmoving party ‘fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case', '-6- * * *.’” Beauregard, 66 A.3d at 493 (quoting Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 228 (R.I. 2007)).', 'The plaintiffs proffer five purported genuine issues of material fact, which they allege precluded the grant of summary judgment. We will address each issue seriatim. First, however, we note that plaintiffs supported their arguments on these points exclusively with references to the complaint. This practice flies in the face of plaintiffs’ burden to prove the existence of a disputed issue of material fact by competent evidence and the rule that a party may not rest upon mere allegations in the pleadings. Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532. Additionally, we note, yet again, that “the authority of [the foreclosing entity] to foreclose on a property or the authority of MERS to assign the mortgage are questions of law and not questions of fact to be determined by a factfinder.” Id.', 'Much of plaintiffs’ attack focuses on the travel of the mortgage and the rights of the mortgage holder.8 The plaintiffs contend that whether MERS is a mortgagee or nominee with the statutory power of sale is a question of fact. They are wrong. We resolved this issue in Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1081 (R.I. 2013). The mortgage at issue in Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1081, stated that “MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) has the right to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property * * *.” The Court concluded that “[t]he plaintiffs 8', 'We assume without deciding that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the assignments of the note and the mortgage. This Court has held that “homeowners in Rhode Island have standing to challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.” Mruk, 82 A.3d at 536. We have yet to address how this narrow exception applies to voidable, as opposed to void, assignments. In Wilson v. HSBC Mortgage Services, Inc., 744 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2014), the First Circuit concluded that homeowners must assert that the mortgage assignment is void to have standing. We recently noted in dicta, that the reasoning in Wilson is persuasive. Moura v.

The mortgage in this case contains an identical provision. Thus, as a matter of law, MERS had the statutory power of sale.', 'Next, plaintiffs claim that the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to Deutsche Bank was void and therefore Deutsche Bank did not have the ability to foreclose. We resolved this issue in Mruk. In Mruk, 82 A.3d at 538, we noted that a mortgage, which was identical to the mortgage in this case, “explicitly granted the power of sale to MERS and its successors and assigns.” We concluded that the assignee of MERS “acquired all the rights which MERS possessed” and therefore possessed “the right to exercise the power of sale.” Id. Similarly, here, Deutsche Bank acquired all the rights which MERS possessed, including the right to exercise the power of sale.', 'The plaintiffs also contend that there is a factual dispute as to the validity of the endorsement of the note in blank by IndyMac. We also resolved this issue in Mruk. In Mruk, 82 A.3d at 533, we recognized the validity of endorsements in blank and concluded that “[t]he plaintiffs[’] unsupported challenges to the validity of the endorsement in blank are not sufficient to create a disputed issue of material fact.”', 'Similarly, here, plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence to support their contention that the note was invalidly endorsed to Deutsche Bank.', 'Finally, plaintiffs allege that the foreclosure sale was not properly noticed and conducted. However, plaintiffs’ argument is premised upon their misconception of the law that only the original lender, or a lender holding both the note and the mortgage, may invoke the power of sale, and Deutsche Bank was that lender. It is clear, however, that Deutsche Bank held both the note and the mortgage at the time of the foreclosure. In accordance with their statutory power of', '-8- sale, and in compliance with the requisite notice of foreclosure, OneWest, acting under power of attorney for Deutsche Bank, properly mailed notice to plaintiffs at least thirty days prior to the sale and advertised the foreclosure sale in the Providence Journal. Therefore, the foreclosure sale was lawfully noticed and conducted.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the Superior Court justice appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

On May 3, 2011, the City of Pawtucket and the Department’s Office of Professional Standards/Internal Affairs charged Laprade in an eighteen-count complaint, alleging violations of Department rules and regulations stemming from his indecent exposure conviction as well as other incidents of alleged misconduct, including sleeping while on duty.2', 'After being notified of the disciplinary charges against him—as well as the city’s recommendation that his employment be terminated—Laprade timely filed a written request for a hearing in accordance with the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights Act (LEOBOR), as set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 28.6 of title 42. In accordance with § 42-28.6-4, a three-person hearing committee was then selected; it was composed of Patrolman Richard Ramirez (Ramirez)—a Providence police officer selected by Laprade—and Major Bruce Moreau (Moreau) from the Pawtucket Police Department, who was chosen by the city. On June 23, 1', 'Laprade was convicted of violating G.L. 1956 § 11-45-2, entitled “Indecent exposure — Disorderly conduct,” which states that “[a] person commits indecent exposure/disorderly conduct when for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or stimulation, such person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly * * * [e]xposes his or her genitals to the view of another under circumstances in which his or her conduct is likely to cause affront, distress, or alarm to that person.” Section 11-45-2(a)(1). Notably, Laprade did not appeal this conviction. 2', 'Specifically, Laprade was charged with one count of violating the code of ethics, five counts of conduct unbecoming of an officer, one count of criminal conduct, two counts of failing to obey orders, one count of failing to provide current contact information, one count of neglecting the duty to obey, one count of insubordination, one count of exerting undue influence upon others, one count of neglect of duty, one count of failing to maintain fitness for duty, one count of incompetence, one count of failing to meet job description, and one count of untruthfulness.', '-2- 2011, these two committee members selected Sergeant Arthur Lee (Lee) of the Providence Police Department to serve as the third committee member and as the chairman of the committee. Lee proceeded to contact the parties, who agreed to hold the first scheduled hearing at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, July 20, 2011.', 'On July 11, 2011—nine days before the scheduled hearing and one day after the statutory deadline set forth in § 42-28.6-5(c)—the city provided Laprade with a list of witnesses and evidence that the city planned to present at the hearing.3 That same day, Moreau returned from vacation and discovered that he had a conflict with the July 20 hearing date. Moreau also learned that a medical issue had arisen with a family member of the city’s legal counsel that also conflicted with the hearing date. Finally, Moreau was notified that the city’s delivery of the witness and evidence list would not comply with LEOBOR unless the hearing date was continued. Based on these circumstances, Moreau contacted the committee chair and requested that the hearing date be continued “a day or two” to avoid any conflicts. Moreau further stated that, if the hearing committee could not meet on one of those days, Lee should “consider drafting 3', 'The evidence and witness list was provided to respondent by a member of the city’s internal affairs office who, the record discloses, did not have experience with LEOBOR proceedings. In pertinent part, G.L. 1956 § 42-28.6-5 provides:', '“(c) Not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing date, the charging law', 'enforcement agency shall provide to the law enforcement officer:', '“(i) A list of all witnesses, known to the agency at that time, to be called', 'by the agency to testify at the hearing;', '“(ii) Copies of all written and/or recorded statements by such witnesses in', 'the possession of the agency; and', '“(iii) A list of all documents and other items to be offered as evidence at', 'the hearing.', '“* * *', '“(e) Failure by either party to comply with the provisions of subsections', '(c) and (d) of this section shall result in the exclusion from the record of the', 'hearing of testimony and/or evidence not timely disclosed in accordance with', 'those subsections.” (Emphasis added.)', '-3- a letter to the [Presiding Justice] requesting an extension of time.” Lee, however, responded that legal counsel for Laprade had objected to changing the hearing date, but had offered to hold the meeting on July 20 anytime between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. As a result, Lee confirmed that, while the timing was subject to change, the hearing would proceed on July 20 as originally scheduled.', 'On July 14, 2011, Moreau wrote to the Presiding Justice of the Superior Court, explaining that, upon opposing counsel’s objection, the committee chair had denied the city’s request for a continuance; he then asked that the statutory thirty-day timeframe for holding the first LEOBOR hearing be extended pursuant to § 42-28.6-5(b).4 Upon receiving a copy of this letter, counsel for Laprade telephoned the Presiding Justice and requested a hearing on the matter. On July 18, 2011, a hearing took place before the Presiding Justice—although no complaint or miscellaneous petition was filed in Superior Court—at which counsel for the city submitted a memorandum of law in support of the requested continuance.5 Although it was counsel for Laprade who requested the hearing, he nonetheless argued that Moreau’s letter to the Presiding Justice was inappropriate, stating that “the Court at this point in the [LEOBOR] proceedings really doesn’t have any jurisdiction to hear anything that is before it.” Counsel explained that the letter had not come from the committee as whole, but rather from one member. Counsel maintained that, when faced with Moreau’s request for a continuance, the committee chair had adhered to the July 20 hearing date—which was within the thirty-day timeframe 4', 'Section 42-28.6-5(b) provides that a LEOBOR hearing shall commence within thirty days of the selection of the hearing committee chair, that all proceedings shall be completed within sixty days thereafter, and that the hearing committee must issue a written decision within thirty days of the conclusion of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the time limits established in § 42-28.6-5(b) “may be extended by the presiding justice of the superior court for good cause shown.” 5', 'This document—captioned “City of Pawtucket v. Officer Nich[a]las Laprade”—did not bear a Superior Court filing number, and was entitled “City of Pawtucket’s petition and memorandum in support thereof for the Honorable Presiding Justice to, among other things, extend the date within which hearings must commence in the above-referenced matter.”', '-4- allowed under § 42-28.6-5. Therefore, counsel for Laprade argued that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to decide the issue, and maintained that the hearing should proceed on July 20 as planned subject only to subsequent review by the Superior Court in accordance with the appeal process specified in § 42-28.6-12.', 'Conversely, the city maintained that, pursuant to § 42-28.6-5(b), the Presiding Justice had jurisdiction to extend the time for the committee to hold its first hearing. Counsel for the city argued that the hearing date should be continued because a family medical issue had arisen that would be addressed on that date and also because Moreau had a commitment which conflicted with the July 20 hearing. The city also noted that a violation of the statutory requirements for presenting the witness and evidence list—mandating disclosure ten days prior to the hearing— had not yet arisen, and would occur only if the hearing proceeded as scheduled; therefore, he argued, the hearing should be continued to avoid potential procedural error. Faced with this argument, counsel for Laprade replied that he would agree to a continuance, as long as the hearing was treated for all purposes as if it was in fact being held on the original date of July 20.', 'On July 18, 2011, the Presiding Justice issued a written order stating that the city’s failure to present the witness and evidence list ten days prior to the scheduled hearing date did not present good cause to extend the hearing date under § 42-28.6-5(b). The order further indicated that the Presiding Justice was, however, “sympathetic to Counsel’s family medical exigency,” and ordered the parties “to agree upon another mutually convenient date for a hearing,” specifying that “the date of the hearing will still be considered as July 20, 2011 for timing purposes.”', 'The parties subsequently agreed to hold the first hearing on Friday, July 22, 2011. On this date, the city again requested that the committee reconsider a continuance of the July 20', '-5- hearing date; however, this request was denied. The hearing committee then took judicial notice of the Presiding Justice’s July 18, 2011 order, specifying that it would not be marked as evidence. Significantly, the committee refused to accept any evidence that day, despite repeated and vigorous attempts by Laprade’s counsel to introduce documents and place evidence on the record. Nonetheless, the chairman was steadfast in his refusal to take any evidence on July 22, 2011. Instead, the proceeding concluded after the committee decided to petition the Presiding Justice to appoint legal counsel to advise the committee—which was subsequently granted—and scheduled the next meeting for September 8, 2011.', 'At the September 8 hearing, the city submitted its complaint against Laprade into evidence, presented an opening statement, and attempted to call its first witness. Counsel for Laprade6 objected to the witness being called, claiming that, pursuant to § 42-28.6-5(e), the city was precluded from presenting witnesses or evidence because it had failed to provide the evidence and witness list to Laprade at least ten days in advance of July 20. In response, the city argued that the disclosure of the witness and evidence lists were in fact timely because the July 22 proceeding—which, in accordance with the Presiding Justice’s July 18 order, was treated as having taken place on July 20—did not constitute a hearing under LEOBOR because no evidence was taken at the proceeding.7 Counsel for Laprade countered that the July 22 proceeding was a hearing under LEOBOR, and, in the alternative, if the committee found that it was not a hearing, the committee would need to treat the September 8 hearing as having occurred on July 20 in order to comply with the Presiding Justice’s order, which explicitly stated that “the 6', 'Laprade did not attend the September 8, 2011 hearing, or any other subsequent proceedings. 7', 'Under the statute, a “hearing” is defined as “any meeting in the course of an investigatory proceeding, other than an interrogation at which no testimony is taken under oath, conducted by a hearing committee for the purpose of taking or adducing testimony or receiving evidence.” Section 42-28.6-1(3) (emphasis added).', '-6- date of the hearing will still be considered as July 20, 2011 for timing purposes.” (Emphasis added.)', 'After the parties’ arguments, the committee reserved decision on the issue and adjourned.', 'At the next hearing, held on September 13, 2011, the parties were informed that the committee had decided that the proceeding held on July 22 was in fact a hearing and that it would be treated as if it had occurred on July 20 based on the July 18 order of the Presiding Justice. As such, the parties were told that the committee had decided that Laprade’s motion to prohibit the city from calling witnesses or introducing evidence was granted. The city responded that, although the committee’s ruling made it impossible to prove a number of charges, the city was still able to proceed on those charges in the complaint pertaining to Laprade’s conviction for indecent exposure.', 'To do so, the city requested that—as a substitute for introducing into evidence the document reflecting the conviction—the committee take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction in accordance with § 42-28.6-10.8 The city—citing Lynch v. King, 120 R.I. 868, 878, 391 A.2d 117, 123 (1978)—also noted that, despite its own inability to introduce witnesses and evidence, “the Legislature has endowed this Committee with very broad powers to investigate allegations of police misconduct,” and “did not intend the Committee to be bound in any way by the recommendation of a charging authority.” Accordingly, the city urged the committee to subpoena Laprade—and other witnesses—and conduct an independent examination of those witnesses.', 'In response, counsel for Laprade argued that the hearing committee could not—on its own initiative and in the absence of the city’s evidence and witness list—subpoena witnesses 8', 'Pursuant to § 42-28.6-10, “[t]he hearing committee conducting the hearing may take notice of judicially cognizable facts and, in addition, may take notice of general, technical, or scientific facts within its specialized knowledge.”', '-7- and, in essence, transform itself into a prosecutorial body. Moreover, Laprade’s counsel argued that, in order for the committee to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction, the city would need to present documentation—presumably, the record of conviction from the District Court— which it was barred from doing because of the committee’s ruling precluding the city from presenting evidence.', 'Faced with these arguments, the committee reserved decision and requested that the parties provide further briefing on the issues raised.9', 'At the next hearing, held on November 18, 2011, the parties were informed that, the committee had decided, by a two-to-one vote, to reject the city’s request to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction for indecent exposure based on the advice of appointed legal counsel. The committee also denied the city’s request to subpoena Laprade to testify, as well as the city’s request that the hearing committee exercise its independent power to subpoena and examine witnesses. The committee also denied the city’s request to call and question Laprade as an adverse party despite the fact that Laprade was not listed on the city’s witness and evidence disclosure list.', 'The committee issued a written decision on December 14, 2011, which recounted the travel and rulings of the LEOBOR proceedings, and detailed the remaining charges against Laprade. This was followed by a “Findings and Conclusions” section which stated that, upon a two-to-one vote, the committee decided that due to the procedural error under § 42-28.6-5(c), the city was unable to present any witnesses or submit any documentary evidence to the committee, and was therefore unable to sustain its burden of proving the allegations. Chairman Lee noted that he “would have been inclined” to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction if the 9', 'Because the timeline given to the parties to provide additional briefing on the issues raised at the hearing brought the proceeding outside of the sixty days allowed to complete LEOBOR proceedings under § 42-28.6-5(b), the committee petitioned for—and was granted—an extension of time by the Presiding Justice.', '-8- committee’s legal counsel had so advised. The decision concluded with a dissent issued by Moreau, who stated that the majority erred by refusing to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction based on the requirement that the city—the party that was precluded from introducing evidence—submit documentation of that conviction.', 'On December 21, 2011, the city timely appealed the committee’s decision to the Superior Court under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15,10 claiming that the committee’s decision was affected by error of law and abuse of discretion. Specifically, the city argued that the committee abused its discretion by refusing to continue the initial July 20, 2011 hearing date. The city also argued that, pursuant to the July 18 order, the Presiding Justice erred by ordering the parties to agree on another date, yet to treat the proceeding as if it had occurred on July 20. Finally, the city argued that the committee’s refusal to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction was based on the erroneous advice of appointed counsel and constituted an abuse of discretion.', 'On October 17, 2012, a justice of the Superior Court issued a written decision finding that the committee’s denial of the city’s request for a continuance of the July 20 hearing date “was neither in excess of statutory authority nor an abuse of discretion.” The Superior Court justice proceeded to address the specific provisions of LEOBOR that allow the Presiding Justice to act at various points in the proceedings; notably, none of the provisions discussed by the Superior Court justice relates to the precise issue before this Court—a requested continuance during the initial thirty-day time period. Nonetheless, she determined that the aforementioned provisions “demonstrate a legislative intent to streamline appealable questions of procedure 10', 'Under § 42-28.6-12(a) of LEOBOR, “[a]ppeals from all decisions rendered by the hearing committee shall be to the superior court in accordance with [G.L. 1956] §§ 42-35-15 and 42-35- 15.1.”', '-9- during the adjudicative process so as to avoid prolonged and costly appeals on questions of technicality.” The Superior Court justice therefore determined that, because the Presiding Justice “has the statutory authority to grant the [c]ommittee relief from certain obligations with respect to deadlines, as well as to order it to take certain actions,” the July 18 order of the Presiding Justice was not appealable under the APA, and further noted that, as an interlocutory order, it was not subject to review by another Superior Court justice under the law of the case doctrine.', 'On the issue of judicial notice, the Superior Court justice stated that under LEOBOR, the committee is vested with the discretion to take judicial notice, and noted that judicial notice of a prior conviction may be taken “despite a party’s failing to formally introduce evidence of the conviction via a certified copy.” However, she did not indicate how this could be accomplished when the party was precluded from introducing any evidence. Nonetheless, she determined that the committee’s refusal to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction “was reasonable and did not amount to an abuse of discretion” based on the circumstances of the LEOBOR proceedings, and noted that, furthermore, there was “no manifest error of law in the written decision of the [c]ommittee.” The Superior Court justice denied the city’s appeal, and a final judgment entered on October 22, 2012. The city filed a petition for certiorari on November 9, 2012, which was granted by this Court on January 10, 2013.', 'Standard of Review', 'As an initial matter, we are confronted with a discrepancy between the standards of review, as advocated by each party, that apply to the issues presented in this case. The petitioner argues that, pursuant to § 42-28.6-12, which governs appeals of decisions in LEOBOR proceedings, the hearing committee is deemed an administrative agency and this Court’s review is therefore governed by the APA. Alternatively, citing to City of Pawtucket, Police Division v.', '- 10 - Ricci, 692 A.2d 678, 682 (R.I. 1997), respondent argues that in LEOBOR cases, “this Court’s review is limited to an examination of the record to determine whether there is some competent evidence to support the committee’s findings.” Based on these apparent inconsistencies, we deem it necessary to resolve this issue.', 'Enacted in 1976, LEOBOR “is the exclusive remedy for permanently appointed law- enforcement officers who are under investigation by a law-enforcement agency for any reason that could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.” In re Simoneau, 652 A.2d 457, 460 (R.I. 1995) (citing Lynch, 120 R.I. at 870 n.1, 391 A.2d at 119 n.1); § 42-28.6-15.

However, the appeal process outlined in § 42-28.6-12 and § 45-20-1.1 did not provide an officer or a charging law enforcement agency with an avenue to appellate review before this Court. In Kurbiec v.

Section 42-28.6-4(c), (d), (e), (f). Although we read this language to require the filing of a petition in Superior Court, we are also cognizant that other provisions exist within LEOBOR that provide for judicial review without specifying that a complaint must first be filed. See, e.g., § 42-28.6-1(2) (allowing presiding justice to take action “[u]pon written application” of a committee member, and upon “motion” of a party). We declare, however, that such provisions within LEOBOR are not excluded from our holding in this case that first requires the filing of a complaint or a miscellaneous petition in the Superior Court to properly invoke its jurisdiction.', '- 16 - 470, 471 (R.I. 2002) (mem.)

This well settled requirement is consistent with our rules of procedure, as well as the appeal process outlined in LEOBOR.15', 'Although the dissent suggests that—by adhering to our rules of procedure and the appellate procedure outlined in LEOBOR—the requisite filing of a complaint or miscellaneous petition in the Superior Court would lead to “untenable results and immeasurably complicate disciplinary matters under LEOBOR,” we cannot agree. LEOBOR proceedings are statutory proceedings that are strictly regulated; these proceedings are not ad hoc, informal avenues to police discipline. The statute unequivocally anticipates the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court at several stages of the proceedings. As such, the dissent’s suggestion that a filing in the Superior Court should occur only at the end of the LEOBOR proceedings—when seeking review pursuant to the APA—is without foundation and inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. Rather, our requirement that a complaint be filed prior to the Superior Court exercising its jurisdiction in a LEOBOR proceeding will streamline the process, eliminate 15', 'In the July 18 order, the Presiding Justice noted that “[a]ny evidentiary issues may properly come before the Court on appeal from either party under § 42-28.6-12.” This authority, however, is circumscribed. Section 42-28.6-12(a) of LEOBOR clearly states that “[a]ppeals from all decisions rendered by the hearing committee shall be to the superior court in accordance with §§ 42-35-15 and 42-35-15.1.”', 'Section 42-35-15(a) allows that, under certain circumstances, an initial ruling of a hearing committee may be subject to immediate review because “[a]ny preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency act or ruling is immediately reviewable in any case in which review of the final agency order would not provide an adequate remedy.” (Emphasis added.) To do so, however, § 42-35-15(b) clearly dictates that to properly invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, all such “[p]roceedings for review are instituted by filing a complaint in the superior court * * * .” (Emphasis added.)', '- 17 - piecemeal appeals, and provide a clear record for appellate review.', 'Moreover, we are convinced that a judicial proceeding occurred in this case and that the Presiding Justice was not acting in an administrative role. We are mindful that counsel for Laprade requested a hearing before the Presiding Justice concerning an issue that was contested between the parties. The Presiding Justice graciously accommodated this request and took the bench, in open court, with a stenographer present, to hear argument. The Presiding Justice then issued an order regarding a matter in which she was asked to exercise her judicial discretion. Having done so, this order was issued with the force of law. Therefore, contrary to the dissent’s belief, this was a judicial proceeding and not an administrative function.', 'As such, in the absence of a complaint or miscellaneous petition filed in the Superior Court, it is clear that the letter sent to the Presiding Justice by Moreau—as well as the telephone call made by Laprade’s counsel—were both inappropriate and insufficient means to properly invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court in this case. We therefore conclude that the Presiding Justice acted without jurisdiction.', 'Even if the Presiding Justice were authorized to proceed, we are of the opinion that she exceeded her authority by ordering the parties to select a different date and then requiring that they treat the initial hearing as if it occurred on July 20, 2011. The authority of the Presiding Justice in this area is clearly limited. Section 42-28.6-5(b) precisely—and unambiguously— states that “[t]he time limits established in this subsection may be extended by the presiding justice of the superior court for good cause shown.” Thus, at this juncture, the Presiding Justice may only become involved in the LEOBOR hearing process for the purpose of extending the time limits enumerated in § 45-28.6-5(b) beyond the statutory deadlines and only upon a showing of good cause.', '- 18 -', 'In the case at bar, after deciding that “the [c]ity’s failure to present its witness and evidence list ten days prior to the hearing does not represent good cause for an extension of the hearing date”—a standard not required for a continuance within the initial thirty-day time limit— the Presiding Justice stated that she was “sympathetic to Counsel’s family medical exigency,” and directed the parties to “agree on a mutually convenient date for [the] hearing.” In so doing, the Presiding Justice found good cause to extend the time limit beyond the thirty days set forth in § 42-28.6-5(b). However, by requiring that the date of the hearing “be considered as July 20, 2011 for timing purposes,” the Presiding Justice erred and exceeded her authority under the unambiguous language of § 42-28.6-5(b), causing the proceedings to be fatally affected by this error of law.', 'Although it is apparent to the Court that this error was the result of good intentions by a sympathetic jurist, we are constrained to hold that the Presiding Justice had no authority to order the parties to treat a hearing date as having taken place on a different date. This is a fiction in which we decline to engage. See In re Sabetta, 661 A.2d at 83 (“[W]hen the language of a statute is unambiguous and expresses a clear and sensible meaning, no room for statutory construction or extension exists, and we are required to give the words of the statute their plain and obvious meaning.”) (quoting Ellis v.

Police disciplinary proceedings under LEOBOR are matters of great public concern, such that the parties and the public should have confidence in the result. See Lynch, 120 R.I. at 874, 391 A.2d at 121 (noting that the exception that this Court may review matters outside the record on certiorari is applicable in LEOBOR proceedings, because the exception applies in “situations involving the public interest,” and “[w]e believe that, because the police act to protect persons and property and to ensure the public safety * * * the public has an interest in the validity of the mechanism whereby allegations of improper conduct by police officers are adjudicated”). Therefore, based on the errors of law committed and our holding in this case, we deem it unnecessary to reach the other issues raised on appeal.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, the decision of the Superior Court is quashed and the decision of the hearing committee is vacated. This matter may be remanded to the Superior Court with further directions to remand this matter to the hearing committee to conduct LEOBOR proceedings regarding the disciplinary charges filed against the respondent de novo and in accordance with this opinion. The rehearing may be conducted before the same hearing committee that was initially chosen to hear the charges—if the members thereof choose to reconvene—or before a hearing committee newly selected for the purpose of conducting a of Laprade’s counsel. Notably, a “hearing” is defined in § 42-28.6-1(3) as “any meeting in the course of an investigatory proceeding * * * conducted by a hearing committee for the purpose of taking or adducing testimony or receiving evidence.” (Emphasis added.) However, because we vacate the hearing committee’s decision and direct that this case be heard de novo by the hearing committee, we need not address this troubling issue.', '- 20 - LEOBOR proceeding de novo. The papers in this case may be returned to the Superior Court with our decision endorsed thereon.', 'Flaherty, J. and Indeglia, J., dissenting. After much reflection, we must respectfully dissent from the majority’s holding that the Presiding Justice acted without jurisdiction and beyond her authority and that the trial justice erred in affirming that action. We further conclude that the trial justice erred when she held that the hearing committee’s refusal to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction was reasonable.', 'While we agree with the majority that ordinarily, “[l]etters, motions, and other documents addressed or provided to justices of the Superior Court do not constitute complaints * * * nor is the jurisdiction of the Superior Court invoked by letter or by communications that do not constitute a complaint[,]” DeWitt v. Wall, 796 A.2d 470, 471 (R.I. 2002) (mem.), we note that the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) provides a unique statutory scheme for disciplinary actions against law enforcement officers. In developing this statutory system, the Legislature explicitly granted to the Presiding Justice certain administrative authority. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 42-28.6-1(2)(i) (stating that, if the two committee members selected by the officer and the agency cannot agree upon a third member, “either member will make application to the presiding justice * * * and the presiding justice shall appoint the third member” and further providing that “[u]pon written application by a majority of the hearing committee, the presiding justice, in his or her discretion, may also appoint legal counsel to assist the hearing committee”); § 42-28.6-1(2)(ii) (providing that “on motion made by either party, the presiding justice shall have the authority to make a different disposition as to what each party is required to pay toward the appointed legal counsel’s legal fee”); § 42-28.6-4(c) (stating that the Presiding Justice “upon', '- 21 - petition and for good cause shown” may permit the filing of an untimely hearing request by either the officer or the agency). We are of the opinion that, when acting under these provisions of LEOBOR, the Presiding Justice is acting in an administrative role and not exercising her traditional judicial authority.', 'We contrast the provisions setting forth the Presiding Justice’s administrative role with § 42-28.6-13(d), which provides for suspension of a law enforcement officer when that officer is charged with a misdemeanor and states that “[t]he law enforcement officer may petition the presiding justice of the superior court for a stay of the suspension without pay, and such stay shall be granted upon a showing that said delay in the criminal disposition was outside the law enforcement officer’s control.” (Emphases added.) We believe the language in that section, which sets forth the standard of review for the Presiding Justice in considering an officer’s petition for a stay, indicates that such petitions should be made via an official filing with the Superior Court. Compare § 42-28.6-1(2) (providing for the appointment of the third member of the hearing committee by the Presiding Justice if the other two members cannot agree upon a third member and either “make[s] application to the presiding justice”), with § 42-28.6-13 (stating that, if suspended without pay, the officer “may petition the presiding justice of the superior court for a stay * * * and such stay shall be granted upon a showing that said delay in the criminal disposition was outside the law enforcement officer’s control”). In determining whether “said delay in the criminal disposition was outside the law enforcement officer’s control,” the Presiding Justice would be exercising a judicial role, making a proper invocation of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court a necessary prerequisite. Section 42-28.6-13(d).', 'It is our firm belief that requiring the filing of a complaint or miscellaneous petition in the Superior Court for all matters concerning the conduct and procedures followed by the hearing', '- 22 - committee would lead to untenable results and immeasurably complicate disciplinary matters under LEOBOR.1 We can envision a situation wherein the parties are unable to agree upon a third committee member and must, according to the majority’s new rule, file an official complaint in the Superior Court in order to have the Presiding Justice appoint that member. Under the majority’s view, if the committee then later desires to request an extension of the time limits set forth in § 42-28.6-5(b), it would need to amend the earlier complaint or file a new complaint for the requested continuance. In the latter alternative, there would be two separate and discrete matters docketed in the Superior Court, both regarding different procedural aspects in the same disciplinary action. To us, this creates not only the possibility, but indeed the probability, of uncertainty and confusion for the parties, as well as for the judicial system.2 Judicial economy alone would appear to dictate that such preliminary procedural matters arising out of one disciplinary action against a particular officer should not be artificially divided into separately docketed petitions at different stages in the LEOBOR process. Consequently, we conclude that the filing of an official complaint or miscellaneous petition in the Superior Court is not necessary in these preliminary procedural matters.', 'We would further dispute the majority’s conclusion that the Presiding Justice exceeded her authority when she required the parties to treat the newly agreed-upon hearing date as if it 1', 'We pause to note that footnote 9 of the majority opinion, wherein it stated that the committee petitioned the Presiding Justice for an extension of the sixty-day limit in G.L. 1956 § 42-28.6- 5(b), which was granted, appears to be inconsistent with the majority’s holding. The majority does not clarify whether the committee officially filed with the Superior Court in order to give the Presiding Justice jurisdiction to grant that extension of time nor does the majority take issue with the validity of that extension. The majority’s holding, however, would appear to indicate that the Presiding Justice would have been acting without jurisdiction in granting the extension if the petition was made directly to her. 2', 'We would also question by what means either the officer or the agency could later appeal the final decision of the committee under § 42-28.6-12, which clearly requires filing a complaint in the Superior Court as in any other administrative appeal under the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 42 of title 35.', '- 23 - had occurred on July 20, 2011, as originally scheduled by the committee. We disagree with the majority’s characterization of the Presiding Justice’s order in concluding that she “found good cause to extend the time limit beyond the thirty days set forth in § 42-28.6-5(b).” Indeed, the Presiding Justice’s order explicitly stated that she did not find good cause to extend under § 42- 28.6-5(b). Accordingly, under the clear terms of the statute, the Presiding Justice could not then grant a continuance beyond the thirty-day limit, and she rightly did not do so. The Presiding Justice’s finding that good cause did not exist was in no way modified when she later stated that a new hearing date would be treated as of July 20 for purposes of the disclosure deadline of § 42- 28.6-5(c).', 'The majority agrees with the city’s position that the hearing committee actually convened on July 22, 2011 and that, as a result, the disclosure deadline was re-set for July 12, 2011, thus permitting the city to enter all its documents into evidence before the committee.', 'This conclusion ignores the fundamental principle of statutory construction that “individual sections [of a statute] must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections.” Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Sorenson v. Colibri Corp., 650 A.2d 125, 128 (R.I. 1994)). The majority limits its discussion to subsection (b) while passing over the disclosure deadline in subsection (c) of § 42-28.6-5 in a somewhat perfunctory fashion.', '“We have consistently held that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, [we] must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603, 611 (R.I. 2013) (quoting In re Estate of Manchester, 66 A.3d 426, 430 (R.I. 2013)). Accordingly, “when we examine an unambiguous statute, there is no room for statutory construction and we must', '- 24 - apply the statute as written.” Morel v. Napolitano, 64 A.3d 1176, 1179 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., LLP, 47 A.3d 319, 328 (R.I. 2012)). In applying these principles, we are of the opinion that the language of LEOBOR is clear and unambiguous with regard to the disclosure deadline. Section 42-28.6-5(c) states that the city “shall provide to the law enforcement officer” the evidence to be presented at the hearing “[n]ot less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing date[.]” If the deadline is not complied with, the statute is equally clear that the remedy is the exclusion of evidence not timely disclosed. See § 42-28.6-5(e). In the instant case, the July 10, 2011 disclosure date was based on the scheduling of the hearing for July 20, 2011. Once the disclosure deadline had been reached and the error made, granting a continuance of the hearing—and by extension, the disclosure deadline—would transform the disclosure deadline into a rolling one that may be extended. Indeed, we emphasize that this elasticity is the consequence of the majority’s holding in this case. However, such an extension of the disclosure deadline is clearly not permitted in the statute. Because the city failed to present its evidence by the disclosure deadline, the city could not circumvent the application of the penalty laid out in § 42-28.6-5(e).', 'We emphasize that the subsections dealing with the time limits for disclosure of evidence do not contain any provision by which those deadlines may be extended or altered. See § 42- 28.6-5(c) and (d). We contrast this with the provision establishing the time limits by which the hearing must be convened and a written decision rendered after the hearing has been completed, which explicitly provides that “[t]he time limits established in this subsection may be extended by the presiding justice of the superior court for good cause shown.” Section 42-28.6-5(b) (emphasis added).', 'It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that, when the Legislature uses a phrase in one provision of a statute but omits it in another, the omission “is', '- 25 - significant to show a different legislative intent for the two sections.” See 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 46:6 at 263-66 (7th rev. ed. 2014). Clearly, if the Legislature had intended that the ten-day disclosure deadline could be changed after it had been set and the deadline had passed, the Legislature knew how to provide for it. It is not for us to rewrite the statute to provide for an extension of the disclosure deadlines when the Legislature specifically did not do so.', 'We are not unsympathetic to the city’s position regarding this seemingly draconian result, i.e., excluding all the evidence the city wished to present as a consequence of missing the disclosure deadline by one day,3 and understand the majority’s wish to give the city the full opportunity to present all its evidence. Our sympathy for the city’s plight, however, does not permit us to step in, as the majority is apparently willing to do, to provide the city a second bite of the apple after the disclosure deadline had been missed.

In his papers to us, Laprade cites a litany of cases from the Superior Court in which the court recognized that LEOBOR was written in such a way that its rigid deadlines could not be avoided. See, e.g., Town of Westerly Police Department v. Burton, 2006 WL 2590094 at *1 n.1 (R.I. Super. Sept. 7, 2006) (in which a Superior Court justice agreed that, because the town had failed to furnish documents in a timely fashion, the documents could not be introduced at the hearing and affirmed the hearing committee’s decision finding the officer “[n]ot [g]uilty based upon lack of evidence”); International Brotherhood of Police Officers Local 369 v.

City of Providence (MP 05-3319) (R.I. Super. June 29, 2005) (in which the then-Presiding Justice upheld the firing of an officer without the benefit of a hearing due to the failure by the officer to follow one of LEOBOR’s deadlines, noting that the “statutory mandate[s] * * * go[] both ways.”).', '- 26 - irrespective of its own opinion of the wisdom, reasonableness, or necessity for the statute.”) (quoting Creditors’ Service Corp. v. Cummings, 57 R.I. 291, 298-99, 190 A. 2, 8 (1937)).', 'We reiterate that the statute does not cloak the Presiding Justice with the authority to extend the disclosure deadline, for good cause or otherwise. Consequently, the Presiding Justice, when faced with the request for a continuance, could not have changed the disclosure deadline even if she had chosen to continue the hearing date. We note that the Presiding Justice was essentially caught between Scylla and Charybdis—bound, on the one hand, by the clear language of the statute and the set disclosure deadline, and on the other hand, understandably wishing to be accommodating to the parties in dealing with “Counsel’s family medical exigency.” Under the circumstances, we believe the Presiding Justice did the only thing she could in attempting to accommodate the parties without violating the statute or unduly prejudicing the rights of either side. As such, we do not discern any error in the Presiding Justice’s order. We agree with Laprade’s suggestion that the order merely formalized a compromise between the parties “as a courtesy to the City’s counsel.” We also believe that the trial justice was correct in affirming the Presiding Justice’s order.', 'While we part company with the majority on the strictness of the disclosure deadline, we hasten to add that the city’s failure to comply with that deadline should not prohibit the city from attempting to make its case by other means. Although this issue was not reached by the majority in this case, the city sought to do so by a request that the committee take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction in the District Court; a conviction that was not appealed. We firmly believe that the committee should have taken judicial notice of that conviction.', 'Section 42-28.6-10 says, “The hearing committee conducting the hearing may take notice of judicially cognizable facts * * * .” The LEOBOR does not define “judicially cognizable', '- 27 - facts”; however, we are in agreement with the trial justice that “[t]he taking of ‘judicial notice,’ which according to Black’s [Law Dictionary] is synonymous with judicial cognizance, is governed by Rule 201 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.” As the trial justice did, we look to Rule 201, which is entitled “Judicial notice of adjudicative facts,” to inform the term “judicially cognizable fact.” Rule 201(b) says, “A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”', 'The city argues that the committee should have taken judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction because the accuracy of the District Court conviction could not reasonably have been questioned. “[T]he decision to take judicial notice of prior judgments is well supported.” In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1175 n.5 (R.I. 2008); see also In re Shawn B., 864 A.2d 621, 624 (R.I. 2005) (noting that the trial justice had taken judicial notice of the defendant’s prior conviction). On the federal level, “[i]t is well-accepted that federal courts may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts if those proceedings have relevance to the matters at hand.” Kowalski v. Gagne, 914 F.2d 299, 305 (1st Cir. 1990). In E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Cullen, 791 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1986), the First Circuit took judicial notice of a complaint filed in a state action after concluding that it had adequate legal power to do so. See St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, 605 F.2d 1169, 1172 (10th Cir. 1979) (“[F]ederal courts, in appropriate circumstances, may take notice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.”).', 'As the trial justice astutely observed, a decision to take judicial notice of a judicially cognizable fact falls within the discretion of the committee because § 42-28.6-10 says that the', '- 28 - committee “may take notice of judicially cognizable facts.” We also agree with the trial justice, and the city, that “Laprade’s conviction is a judicially cognizable fact because it is capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, namely the publicly-available records of this [s]tate.” We nevertheless depart from the trial justice’s rationale and conclude that she committed legal error when she determined that the committee’s decision to decline to take judicial notice of the conviction was a proper exercise of its discretion. In doing so, we necessarily conclude that the committee made an error of law when it declined to take judicial notice.', 'In her decision, the trial justice determined that LEOBOR prohibited the city from introducing any evidence at the hearing because the city had failed to present its witness and evidence list ten days before the hearing. Therefore, she ruled, it would have been inappropriate for the committee to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction because “§ 42-28.6-5(c) prevent[ed] the [c]ommittee from examining proof of the alleged fact in any evidentiary capacity.” Section 42-28.6-5(c)(iii) requires disclosure of, inter alia, “[a] list of all documents and other items to be offered as evidence at the hearing.” (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the failure to comply with that provision requires “the exclusion from the record of the hearing * * * evidence not timely disclosed * * * .” Section 42-28.6-5(e). Although we agree that the city could not introduce evidence after the presiding justice ruled that it had failed to meet the disclosure requirements under § 42-28.6-5(c), that did not preclude the committee from taking judicial notice of the conviction because that doctrine provides an alternative vehicle for providing information to the decision maker without the necessity of evidence.', '“Judicial notice of facts serves as a substitute for testimonial, documentary, or real evidence and relieves a proponent from formally proving certain facts that reasonable persons', '- 29 - would not dispute.” United States v. Harper, 32 M.J. 620, 622 (A.C.M.R. 1991); see also York v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 95 F.3d 948, 958 (10th Cir. 1996) (“Judicial notice is an adjudicative device that alleviates the parties’ evidentiary duties at trial, serving as a substitute for the conventional method of taking evidence to establish facts.”) (quoting Grand Opera Co. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 235 F.2d 303, 307 (7th Cir. 1956)); Wesley-Jessen Division of Schering Corp. v. Bausch & Lomb Inc., 698 F.2d 862, 865 (7th Cir. 1983) (“Judicial notice, in essence, is a substitute for evidence.”). It is our view that the committee should have taken judicial notice of the conviction because, even though the certified copy of the conviction could not have been offered in an evidentiary fashion, it nevertheless remained eligible to be reviewed for the purposes of judicial notice.4 To the extent that the committee determined that § 42-28.6- 5(e) precluded it from taking judicial notice, we conclude that that determination was an error of law. It is therefore our opinion that the trial justice erred when she concluded that the committee acted reasonably in declining to take notice of the conviction because nothing in § 42-28.6-5 prevented the committee from doing so.', 'Conclusion', 'Therefore, we dissent from the majority’s holding that the Presiding Justice acted without jurisdiction and in excess of her authority in ordering the parties to treat the new hearing date as if it occurred on July 20, 2011. Accordingly, we also dissent from the majority’s mandate that the hearing be conducted de novo; rather, we conclude that the matter should be remanded for the committee to take judicial notice of Laprade’s conviction in District Court and issue a new written decision. 4', 'We note that judicial notice of the conviction for “disorderly conduct/indecent exposure” may not persuade the committee to sustain the charges against Laprade.

The defendant appeals that decision,3 contending that the trial justice erred in: (1) denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial on the claim of maintenance and cure because the trial justice, sua sponte, gave what the defendant considers to be an improper instruction to the jury with respect to “unearned wages;” (2) granting the plaintiff a new trial on the issues of negligence under the Jones Act and breach of the warranty of seaworthiness because, in the defendant’s view, the trial justice “overlooked” and “misconstrued” testimony, resulting in a decision which was “clearly wrong;” and (3) applying Rhode Island’s prejudgment interest statute, as codified in G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10, as opposed to the principles of general federal maritime law pertaining to prejudgment interest.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to the claim for maintenance and cure. We likewise vacate the trial justice’s grant of plaintiff’s motion for a new trial on the claims of negligence under the Jones Act and breach of the warranty of seaworthiness.

The complaint contained a claim for maintenance and cure4 (Count One); a claim for negligence under the federal Jones Act (Count Two); and a claim for breach of the “warranty of seaworthiness” (Count Three).

However, upon a review of the record, there is nothing to indicate that defendant ever submitted such a proposed instruction. 6', 'We are aware that plaintiff was not the first witness to testify; but, in the interest of clarity, we believe it helpful to recount the relevant aspects of his testimony at the outset.', '-3- It was his testimony that during that time period he went on multiple fishing trips and earned approximately $54,000. When asked how he “would * * * know who was going on * * * the next trip,” it was Mr. King’s testimony that he would do “boat duty to follow the trip that [he] just finished and Kyle [Goodwin][7] would make the list out and determine who was going on that trip and who was going to stay on shore.”', 'According to Mr. King’s testimony, on May 31, 2006, he arrived at the Persistence for “boat duty” (because the vessel was in between fishing trips), and he was assigned painting duty. He stated that he was assigned to paint the “coaming,”8 which was located “in between the second and third floor hatch;” Mr. King further explained that the coaming was on the ceiling of the “fish hold deck” and on the floor of the room above (the “packing room”). It was his testimony that he placed a “stepladder” on the “cement floor of the fish hold;” he added that he “didn’t believe [the stepladder] was on a slant.” He indicated in this testimony that, as he reached the second rung of the stepladder, it “seemed to come out from underneath [him] and [he] fell” to his left. When asked if he knew why the stepladder came out from underneath him, he responded: “No. I do not.” It was also his testimony that, after he fell, but on the same day as the fall, he noticed that the stepladder had “two deep gouges or cuts” on the “bottom rung.”', 'Mr. King testified that after the fall he experienced pain in his left arm from his “wrist all the way to [his] shoulder,” but he said that he “attempted to continue to finish [his work that] day.” He added that he had never seen a stepladder “lashed” or “blocked” on the Persistence and that he had never observed a “spotter” being employed.

He further testified that he underwent two surgeries on his left shoulder to repair the rotator cuff. When asked at trial about his expenses, his testimony indicated that the cost of his mortgage and utilities was approximately $37 per day, while his expenses for food were approximately $15 per day. He acknowledged that defendant had made payments to him for “maintenance” and had also paid him what he characterized as an “advance,” but he added that those payments stopped in February of 2008. The plaintiff contends that the maintenance payments should not have been halted because, as Dr. Gary Perlmutter testified at his deposition, plaintiff did not reach his “maximum medical end result” until March 9, 2010.9 Albert Sabello, a “vocational rehabilitation counselor,” testified at trial that, due to the injury to plaintiff’s left arm, he would not be able to return to work as an offshore fisherman; he stated that the duties of a fisherman were “beyond [plaintiff’s] physical ability for lifting, using manual motor coordination, [and] dexterity.”', 'On cross-examination, plaintiff testified that, after he positioned the stepladder on the day of the accident, it was “as level as it could possibly be,” but he acknowledged that the floor of the fish hold was “pretty rutted” and had a “tiny * * * bow.” He further testified that, if one of the other individuals working on the Persistence that day saw something wrong with the placement of his stepladder, that person “should have said something” to him.', 'ii.', 'The Testimony of Christopher Weisensee', 'Christopher Weisensee testified that he was a “[d]eckhand” working on the Persistence on the day that plaintiff fell. He further stated that the vessel was tied up at the dock on that day; 9', 'According to plaintiff’s testimony, Dr. Gary Perlmutter was his treating physician when he underwent a second surgery to repair the tear in his rotator cuff. As plaintiff states in his brief, Dr. Perlmutter’s videotaped deposition was played for the jury at trial. The transcript of Dr. Perlmutter’s deposition reflects that, by March 9, 2010, he considered plaintiff to have reached his “maximum medical end result” and concluded that “no further treatment was warranted.”', '-5- and, when he was then asked if the vessel moved back and forth when tied to the dock, he responded: “Not noticeably usually.” It was Mr. Weisensee’s testimony that the captain made the decision as to who would go on each fishing trip; he stated that the captain “picks who he feels deserves to go.” It was his further testimony that the composition of the crew was not the same from trip to trip.', 'Mr. Weisensee testified that he was working with plaintiff in the fish hold on the day of plaintiff’s fall. He stated that he was about twenty feet away from plaintiff and that he saw him place the stepladder on a “slant” because the fish hold was not “completely straight in all areas.” At trial, he claimed that he had not seen plaintiff climb the stepladder or fall from it; he explained that, although he had said in his deposition that plaintiff was on the second step of the stepladder when he fell, he had merely “assumed” that plaintiff was on the second step “based on how much time it took at the time.” During cross-examination, he clarified the latter statement by testifying that “two or three” seconds elapsed between the moment when he “glanced” over and saw plaintiff setting up his stepladder and the eventual fall. According to Mr. Weisensee’s testimony, plaintiff fell to his left.', 'Mr. Weisensee also stated that setting up the stepladder on a slant was “not smart.” However, he explained that he did not say anything to plaintiff about the slanted stepladder—not because he did not “care,” but rather because he did not know that plaintiff was going to “climb up and hurt himself.” He then acknowledged that in his deposition he had stated:', '“We’re in harm’s way all the time. Somebody’s doing something', 'stupid, they’re just being stupid. I don’t really care. It’s not my', 'problem. Go hurt yourself. I don’t care.

His testimony indicated that he could see Mr. King through an open central hatch. He testified that he was painting, and he added that there was “sufficient ventilation” so that there were not any “dangerous vapors.” He further stated that the paint was not making his eyes “red and glossy.” However, plaintiff’s counsel confronted him with his deposition testimony, in which he had stated that the paint vapors were “kind of” making his eyes red and glossy. It was further his testimony that, when plaintiff fell, he was carrying “his paint brush and his container in his hands * * * .” He testified that plaintiff climbed to the third step and that the stepladder toppled to the right, while plaintiff fell to the left.', 'iv.', 'The Testimony of Allan Feldman', 'Allan Feldman testified that he was an “emeritus professor” at Brown University, having worked in the Economics Department since 1971. He testified at trial with respect to plaintiff’s economic loss. In his testimony he explained that he projected lost income for plaintiff as a fisherman at $54,500 per year for the four and a half years between plaintiff’s injury and the trial. It was his further testimony that that resulted in his calculating the “total lost earnings over the period starting in the year 2006, the date of the accident, through the [date of the trial]” to be', '-7- $254,166. He further testified that he calculated plaintiff’s potential earnings “from the end of the current year until the end of [plaintiff’s] work life expectancy” to be “$642,836.”', 'v.', 'The Testimony of Grant Parker', 'Grant Parker, a “sea captain” with thirty-five years of experience, who was qualified as an expert, testified that a stepladder was an “inherently unsafe” item to use on a vessel; he added that “a platform ladder” or “a vertical ladder” should have been used. He further indicated in his testimony that the specific stepladder used by plaintiff on the day of his fall should have been “taken out of service” (i.e., removed from the vessel) because there were “cuts in the bottom rung.” In the course of his testimony, Captain Parker opined that every employee on a vessel has a responsibility to maintain a safe work environment; he stated that the “reasonable prudent seaman” is obligated to “alert [another seaman] that he’s standing in harm’s way and to remove the hazard or alert the seaman that he’s then standing in harm’s way and not allow that unsafe act to continue.”', 'He added that crew members should be instructed “about the safe working procedure.” Finally, when asked whether or not he had “an opinion to a reasonable degree of certainty whether the fishing vessel Persistence was a reasonably safe place to work as it lay at the dock on May 31, 2006,” he responded as follows: “I would have to say none [sic] due to the ladder condition and the disposition of the seaman not willing to stand and alert his fellow seaman that there’s an unsafe condition.”', 'Captain Parker acknowledged on cross-examination that a vessel tied to a dock, as the Persistence was when plaintiff fell, is very stable.', '-8-', '2', 'The Defendant’s Witnesses', 'i.', 'The Testimony of Glenn Goodwin', 'Glenn Goodwin testified that he was “a part owner and the captain of the fishing vessel Persistence;” he added that he was a captain full-time from 1986 to 1994 and thereafter continued to captain the vessel on a part-time basis. He testified that stepladders were used “all the time just to let us do overhead activities, wires being run and painting and all * * * .” When asked whether, “based on [his] experience as a captain on a fishing vessel and the fishing vessel Persistence for 25 years [he] believe[d] that * * * a crewman on a vessel [who] would not come to the aid of a fellow crewman intentionally ha[d] a place on * * * [that] vessel,” he responded in the negative. However, when asked if he were to see “someone in the process of setting up a ladder and [he] glanced over and while they were setting it up [he] saw it slanted, would you * * * warn them before * * * you knew they were getting on the ladder,” he replied as follows: “When they were setting the ladder up I don’t know if I would warn them at that point.” Captain Goodwin added that he possibly would not do so because he “wouldn’t be really convinced that that was where [the ladder] was going to be used.”', 'ii.', 'The Testimony of David Webb and JoAnn Greene', 'David Webb testified that he was working as a “deckhand” on the Persistence on May 31, 2006. It was his testimony that on that date the fish hold was “dry;” he added that he was working in the “forward section” of the fish hold on that day and was not “affected” by the paint fumes. He further stated that the vessel was “stationary.” It was his further testimony that he had “[m]any times” used the same stepladder that Mr. King was using on May 31, 2006.', '-9-', 'JoAnn Greene, a “bookkeeper” for defendant, testified that plaintiff went on “sixty-two and a half percent” of the Persistence’s fishing trips from 2005 to 2006; she added that, in the over twenty years that she had worked for defendant, only one crewman (as contrasted with “captains or engineers”) had worked beyond the age of fifty.', 'B', 'The Jury Instructions, Closing Arguments, and Verdict', 'In the course of instructing the jury with respect to the count for maintenance and cure (Count One), the trial justice stated:', '“If Mr. King is entitled to maintenance and cure, then you should', 'also award him unearned wages from the date of Mr. King’s injury', 'until the end of the period for which * * * Huntress agreed he', 'would work, that is, when he was serving the ship.” After the jury instructions had been given, but before closing arguments, defense counsel raised an issue concerning the trial justice’s instruction on unearned wages; at sidebar, he addressed the trial justice as follows:', '“On the wages you mentioned that he’s entitled to maintenance', 'and cure and he’s entitled to unearned wages.

It also contended that the jury must have “misunderstood” the court’s instruction because it awarded “five times” the amount of damages that plaintiff was seeking for maintenance. (Emphasis in original.) In the alternative, defendant sought a remittitur of the judgment to $30,000—that amount being what defendant argued plaintiff was entitled to for maintenance after his wife’s financial contribution to the household was taken into account.', 'The plaintiff for his part moved for a new trial with respect to Counts Two and Three (negligence under the Jones Act and breach of the warranty of seaworthiness). The plaintiff’s counsel recounted the evidence (some of which he claimed was unchallenged) that he believed would support defendant’s liability on Counts Two and Three; he then set forth a number of alleged errors, none of which are at issue in this appeal. In a memorandum filed after the court held a hearing on the new trial motions but before it ruled on those motions, plaintiff’s counsel argued that “[r]easonable individuals could not have come to the conclusion reached by the jury” with respect to Counts Two and Three and that, therefore, he was entitled to a new trial on those counts.', '- 13 -', 'On January 24, 2011, each party having objected to the other party’s motion for a new trial, a hearing was held, at which the parties were given the opportunity to present argument with respect to their respective motions for a new trial as well as the issue of prejudgment interest. With respect to prejudgment interest, plaintiff’s counsel argued that the Rhode Island prejudgment interest statute, as codified in § 9-21-10, should be applied; he stated that the act of calculating prejudgment interest was “ministerial,” “not discretionary.” The plaintiff’s counsel further argued that the “status quo” would be preserved if the court were to employ the 12 percent prejudgment interest set forth in § 9-21-10; and, with respect to his “status quo” contention, he stated: “If that is to be disrupted, * * * it is for the defendant to do it, if the defendant seeks to do it. [The plaintiff is] perfectly happy with the status quo being maintained.” In contrast, defense counsel contended that the issue of prejudgment interest was a “substantive area of law” and that, “by virtue of the federal common law of admiralty,” the awarding of prejudgment interest was properly in “the discretion of the jury.” He stated that the rule that prejudgment “interest must be submitted to the jury [was] the accepted rule of admiralty jurisprudence.”', 'At the January 24, 2011 hearing, the trial justice issued a decision from the bench with respect to the issue of prejudgment interest.

In order to properly decide the issues presented to us on appeal we must discuss, at some length, the trial justice’s June 1 decision on the motions for a new trial.', 'The trial justice began by addressing defendant’s motion for a new trial concerning the issue of maintenance. In compliance with the standard articulated by this Court with respect to motions for a new trial, the trial justice initially reviewed the evidence presented to the fact- finders. He addressed the testimony of plaintiff, Mr. Sabella, Dr. Feldman, and Dr. Perlmutter. With respect to the jury’s award of damages for maintenance, he stated:', '“While this is more than the amount calculated by Dr. Feldman,', 'the jury was attentive and considered all of the evidence. It was', 'within its province to consider the extent of Mr. King’s harm, and', 'to weigh other factors, such as how many fishing journeys he may', 'have attended, or the varying success of each fishing trip. The', 'jury’s result was reasonable.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to discuss defendant’s contentions with respect to whether the jury instruction relative to unearned wages was in error. The trial justice pointed out that he had told the parties that “an admiralty personal injury case was novel for a Superior Court trial” and that he had requested that the parties file pretrial memoranda. He added that he did not receive any such memorandum or a request for jury instructions from defendant until the trial was nearly over—even though, according to the trial justice, plaintiff had filed an extensive request for instructions a “week before trial,” in which plaintiff included a “request [for] an award for lost', '- 15 - earnings.”11 The trial justice further stated that, with reference to the jury instruction concerning unearned wages, defendant’s “objection on ‘wages’ if it was an objection, was obscure.” He continued by referencing Rule 51(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure,12 which deals with objections to jury instructions; and he then found that defendant had not stated “distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial on the issue of maintenance, stating: “There was no clear explanation or objection. Hence, Huntress cannot assign the instruction as error.”', 'The trial justice then turned to a discussion of plaintiff’s motion for a new trial with respect to Counts Two and Three. He noted that, “[w]hile Mr. King presented a significant case on liability it was not iron-clad;” he then proceeded to discuss the testimony of Mr. Weisensee, deeming it “worthy of extensive comment.” The trial justice found that, after Mr. Weisensee testified that “Mr. King’s ladder was not positioned on a level floor” and that Mr. Weisensee was aware of that fact before Mr. King climbed the ladder, Mr. Weisensee’s “demeanor significantly changed and he became uncooperative * * * .” In the view of the trial justice, Mr. Weisensee’s 11', 'The trial justice added: “No citations were provided to the court regarding how to compute the damages for maintenance, until after the verdict was received and the jury was discharged.” 12', 'Rule 51(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides as follows:', '“At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial', 'as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests', 'that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the', 'requests. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to', 'give an instruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury', 'retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which', 'the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.', 'Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing', 'of the jury.”', '- 16 - “reluctance * * * to respond to questions posed by Mr. King’s counsel at the trial” was the reason for portions of his deposition being read into the record. The trial justice made specific reference to the portion of that deposition where Mr. Weisensee stated:', '“We’re in harm’s way all the time. Somebody’s doing something', 'stupid, they’re just being stupid. I don’t really care. It’s not my', 'problem. Go hurt yourself. I don’t care. It’s not my problem.”', 'Turning next to the testimony of Captain Parker, the trial justice pointed out that Captain Parker testified that “the standard of care is for a seaman to help another seaman in harm’s way, and not allow an unsafe operation to continue”—testimony which, according to the trial justice, was not “questioned on cross-examination” and was “acknowledged” by Glenn Goodwin in his testimony at trial. Consequently, in the trial justice’s judgment, Mr. Weisensee’s “failure to warn violated the standard of care” and “proximately caused the harm” at issue in the case. Accordingly, the trial justice stated that he could not “conclude that Huntress, and its staff, had no negligence at all” because “[a] poorly trained or unfit crew constitute[d] unseaworthiness.” The trial justice found that, “[t]o the extent Mr. Weisensee failed to warn and knew he should do so, Huntress was negligent;” he further found that, “[i]f Mr. Weisensee did not know his obligation to warn, then he was inadequately trained for his employment in the fishing industry.” The trial justice concluded his analysis of plaintiff’s motion for a new trial as follows:', '“In consideration of the testimony of the witnesses regarding the', 'factual events, the expert testimony adduced and the materials', 'submitted as evidence, and the reasonable inferences drawn', 'therefrom, the jury’s verdict is against the fair preponderance of', 'the evidence. The verdicts relative to the negligence and', 'unseaworthiness counts failed to do justice or respond to the merits', 'of the controversy. * * * Reasonable minds could not have come to', 'the conclusion reached by the jury.

While unearned wages are awardable only to the end of the voyage on which the seaman is injured or for the duration of his or her employment contract (if there is one), future lost wages could conceivably be recoverable under a negligence or breach of the duty of seaworthiness claim for the duration of a seaman’s work life expectancy. See Jones, 155 F.3d at 592. The court in Vickers v. Tumey, 290 F.2d 426, 434-35 (5th Cir. 1961) explained the distinction as follows:', '“[A] classic element of damages in any personal injury claim', 'where the standard of recovery is a pecuniary loss, is the inability,', '- 28 - Cruises, Ltd., 93 F.

Thus, we hold that Mr. King was only entitled to recover unearned wages as part of his claim for maintenance and cure for either: (1) the duration of the voyage on which he was injured (which is not relevant here since the Persistence was docked when Mr. King’s injury occurred); or (2) for the duration of an employment contract between Mr. King and defendant, if there was such a contract.', 'The plaintiff relies on Robinson v.

The opinion in Robinson is silent as to whether there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant which might have entitled him to unearned wages until the end of the fishing season; additionally, other than the just-quoted sentence, the Robinson opinion contains no further discussion of the issue. Id.', 'Importantly, in support of the just-quoted sentence, the Court in Robinson cited to Vitco v. Joncich, 130 F. Supp. 945 (S.D. Cal. 1955), which was affirmed by Joncich v. Vitco, 234 F.2d 161 (9th Cir. 1956). Robinson, 477 F.2d at 1051. The cited district court opinion in Vitco provides that “[a]long with the obligation to provide maintenance and cure, the maritime law attaches to the seaman’s contract of employment the right to receive his agreed wages throughout the period of employment * * * which historically has meant to the end of the voyage, since the general custom in ships, other than the coastwise trade, is to sign on for a voyage rather than for a fixed period.” Vitco, 130 F. Supp. at 949 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court in Vitco held that the seaman was entitled to unearned wages (or a share of the catch) until the end of the fishing season when, unlike in the instant case, there had been an oral invitation by the defendant to the plaintiff to join the crew for the tuna fishing season. Accordingly, we are not swayed by the passing reference to the fishing season in Robinson, especially given the clarity in federal maritime law with regard to when a seaman is entitled to unearned wages as part of a claim for maintenance and cure.', 'It is abundantly clear from a review of the testimony and evidence presented at trial in the instant case that at no relevant time was there an employment contract between Mr. King and', '- 30 - defendant. Mr. King himself testified that he would do “boat duty to follow the trip that [he] just finished and Kyle [Goodwin] would make the list out and determine who was going on that trip and who was going to stay on shore.” Mr. Weisensee testified that the captain would decide who would go on each fishing trip and that the captain “pick[ed] who he fe[lt] deserve[d] to go;” he added that the composition of the crew was not the same from fishing trip to fishing trip. Moreover, JoAnn Greene testified that, during the years when Mr. King worked for defendant, he only went on “sixty-two and a half percent” of the Persistence’s fishing trips. The plaintiff, who had the burden of proving that there was an employment agreement of a specified duration between defendant and him, did nothing to rebut that evidence. In fact, he did not enter a contract into evidence at all;25 and, as defendant points out, “[p]erhaps more compelling, [when plaintiff testified, he] was never even asked about any such agreement by his attorney.” 26 There was simply no evidence at trial that a contract existed between Mr. King and defendant; as such, in accordance with the applicable federal maritime law, Mr. King was not entitled to any unearned wages. See Farrell, 336 U.S. at 520-21.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s jury instruction with respect to unearned wages was given in error in that it was an incomplete and insufficient statement of the law. The trial justice stated that, if the jury awarded maintenance and cure, it “should also award * * * unearned wages * * * when [Mr. King] was serving the ship.” The trial justice was correct that plaintiff was entitled to be compensated under maintenance and cure for the duration 25', 'We note that, in the course of the hearing on the parties’ motions for a new trial, plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged that “[t]he jury positively never had a contract” before it. 26', 'It is further noteworthy that there was also no evidence presented at trial to support plaintiff’s statement on appeal that the jury must have found that there was an implied-in-fact contract between him and defendant.', '- 31 - of his employment contract; i.e., when “he was serving the ship.” However, the trial justice failed to explain that plaintiff was “serving the ship” only if he was on a voyage or had an employment contract for a specified duration.

It is further our view that, because the unearned wages jury instruction was somewhat ambiguous in the eyes of this Court, it is quite probable that it was even more so for the lay jurors. See Baccari, 741 A.2d at 264.', 'The fact that the incomplete jury instruction given by the trial justice with respect to unearned wages “misled” the jury is evident when one considers the jury award—the $257,500 jury award for maintenance and cure is simply not supported by the evidence. Botelho, 970 A.2d at 545 (internal quotation marks omitted). Since plaintiff was not entitled to unearned wages and the parties agreed that cure had already been paid, plaintiff was entitled only to compensation for his food and lodging from the date of his injury until his maximum medical recovery on March 9, 2010. Moreover, as plaintiff acknowledged, much of those maintenance expenses had already been paid by defendant. In fact, plaintiff’s testimony reflects the fact that he was only seeking $37 per day for his mortgage and utilities and $15 a day for his food expenses from February of 2008 (when defendant stopped paying) until March 9, 2010. On the basis of this Court’s rough calculations, that does not amount to a sum close to $257,500. Thus, there was no basis for the jury’s award of $257,500 unless the jurors, incorrectly, took into account plaintiff’s unearned wages.27 Therefore, it is our decided opinion that the trial justice’s erroneous jury instruction 27', 'We deem it entirely possible that, when the unearned wages jury instruction is considered in the context of the entirety of the jury instructions, the jury did not properly fathom the distinction between the lost wages (on which there was testimony by Dr. Feldman) that it could', '- 32 - “misled” the jury “to the resultant prejudice” of defendant.', 'Id.

It argues that, “had [the trial justice] conducted the correct analysis in light of the correct law, the excessiveness of the jury’s award would have been evident.” The majority of the trial justice’s decision on defendant’s motion for a new trial was devoted to addressing the reasons why he was of the opinion that any challenge to the jury instruction concerning unearned wages was waived.', 'However, due to the fact that we have already determined that a new trial should be held on plaintiff’s claim for maintenance and cure, we need not discuss whether the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or was otherwise clearly in error in the portion of his discussion which related to the jury’s award on the claim of maintenance and cure.

The defendant additionally avers that the trial justice misconstrued the testimony on which he did rely and impermissibly considered portions of Mr. Weisensee’s deposition testimony which were not read into the record at trial and, accordingly, were not before the jury. The defendant concludes its argument by stating: “[T]he trial evidence shows the error in the [trial] judge’s decision.

Our several reasons for reaching that conclusion are detailed below.', 'We begin by noting that a review of the record indicates that defendant’s contention that the trial justice relied on portions of the deposition testimony of Mr. Weisensee which were not in evidence at the trial is correct. In fact, plaintiff concedes that point in his brief to this Court, stating: “Without doubt the trial justice referred to a deposition that had not been before the and Seaworthiness, 75 Yale L.J. 1174 (1966); LaVerne Evans, Maritime Personal Injuries and the Doctrine of Seaworthiness, A Matter of Status, 19 JAG J. 13 (1964).', '- 37 - jury * * * .”30 The plaintiff contends that the references by the trial justice are cumulative and, therefore, harmless.

The first occurs when the trial justice quotes as follows:', '“A: No, I didn’t say anything about it.', '“Q: Why didn’t you say anything?', '“A: We’re in harm’s way all the time.

Ultimately we held in Greensleeves that, while it was “imprudent” for the trial justice to have relied on evidence outside the record, such reliance was “harmless” in that case. Id. In view of our reasoning in Greensleeves, plaintiff’s argument that the trial justice’s reliance on Mr. Weisensee’s deposition testimony was harmless is not entirely without merit. However, even if the trial justice’s references to the portions of Mr. Weisnesee’s deposition testimony which were not presented to the jury at trial would not suffice in and of themselves to necessitate vacating the trial justice’s decision, they do tend to suggest that his broader consideration of the evidence may also have been based upon inaccuracies—resulting in, as we discuss infra, the overlooking and mischaracterizing of material evidence by the trial justice and, consequently, clear error.31', 'It does not require an exhaustive review of the trial justice’s decision to arrive at the ineluctable conclusion that he did, in fact, overlook and mischaracterize material evidence. In the course of ruling on plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice discussed only the testimony of Mr. Weisensee and Captain Grant Parker, with a passing reference to the testimony of Glenn Goodwin. The trial justice overlooked the material testimony of David Reposa, David 31', 'We further point out that the trial justice stated in his decision that Mr. Weisensee’s testimony was “worthy of extensive comment” due to the fact that he “was the only person in the fishhold with Mr. King at the time of the fall.” However, this statement is inconsistent with other testimony in the record. David Webb, a deckhand on the Persistence, testified that he was “painting” in the “forward section” of the “fish hold” on the day in question and was “20 feet” away from plaintiff when he fell. (Emphasis added.)

See Panarello v. State, Department of Corrections, 88 A.3d 350, 373 (R.I. 2014) (stating that, whereas a trial justice is not required to “expressly reference every last bit of the evidence * * * [he or she] need only discuss sufficient evidence for it to be clear to this Court that the standard applied was appropriate”). In our judgment, by failing to consider the material testimony of the three above-mentioned witnesses, the trial justice failed to reference enough evidence for this Court to be satisfied that he applied the correct standard. See id.; Anderson v. Johnson, 59 R.I. 241, 247, 195 A. 240, 243 (1937) (holding that a trial justice erred when he, without “sufficient reason[,] * * * completely ignor[ed] the testimony of one group of interested witnesses, who were apparently believed by the jury, and in accepting the testimony of the other equally interested group, whom the jury did not believe”).', 'In addition to overlooking the testimony of Mr. Reposa, Mr. Webb, and plaintiff, the trial justice, in rendering his decision, also critically overlooked portions of Mr. Weisensee’s own testimony. The trial justice focused almost exclusively on the following statement made by Mr. Weisensee at his deposition and read into the record at trial: 32', 'For example, the trial justice did not discuss the portions of plaintiff’s testimony which reflected the fact that plaintiff did not think the stepladder was placed on a slant (although he acknowledged that the fish hold was “pretty rutted”). This testimony was particularly relevant in view of the consideration that (as defense counsel suggested in his cross-examination of Mr. King), if the stepladder was not placed on a slant, there was nothing wrong with the stepladder which Mr. Weisensee could have noticed and warned plaintiff about.', 'The trial justice also neglected to weigh the fact that, despite plaintiff’s testimony that he was not carrying anything when he climbed the stepladder, Mr. Reposa testified that, when plaintiff went up the stepladder, he was carrying “his paint brush and his container * * * of paint.” (Therefore, presumably, plaintiff could not have grasped the stepladder for balance.) The trial justice further ignored testimony by David Webb to the effect that he had “[m]any times” used without incident the same stepladder that Mr. King used on the date in question. Even these examples, which only scratch the surface of the overlooked testimony, tellingly illustrate the fact that the trial justice clearly erred in overlooking material evidence in this case.', '- 40 -', '“We’re in harm’s way all the time. Somebody’s doing something', 'stupid, they’re just being stupid. I don’t really care. It’s not my', 'problem. Go hurt yourself. I don’t care. It’s not my problem.” The trial justice used that statement by Mr. Weisensee, coupled with testimony by Captain Parker that stepladders were “inherently unsafe” on any vessel and that (in the words of the trial justice) “the standard of care among sea vessels is that each member of the crew is responsible for the safety of each other member,” as predicates for his holding that Mr. Weisensee’s failure to warn plaintiff of his slanted stepladder deviated from the standard of care. The trial justice further stated that, if Mr. Weisensee did not know of his duty to warn, then defendant deviated from the standard of care because Mr. Weisensee had been inadequately trained.', 'It was consequently the opinion of the trial justice that he could not “conclude that the negligence count fails completely” and that “[t]o the extent Mr. Weisensee failed to warn and knew he should do so, Huntress was negligent.” The trial justice determined that the jury’s verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and that “[r]easonable minds could not have come to the conclusion reached by the jury.”', 'What the trial justice neglected to consider was contradictory testimony from Mr. Weisensee’s own lips suggesting that he did not simply fail to warn plaintiff with respect to his slanted stepladder because he did not “care” or because it was not his “problem.”', 'To begin with, it was Mr. Weisensee’s testimony at trial that he did not see plaintiff climb the stepladder after placing it on a slant and that he did not see plaintiff fall. 33 On direct examination at trial, 33', 'It should be recalled that Mr. Weisensee explained at trial that, although he had said in his deposition that plaintiff was on the second step of the stepladder when he fell, he had merely “assumed” that plaintiff was on the second step “based on how much time it took at the time.” He clarified that statement during cross-examination when he testified that “two or three” seconds elapsed between the moment when he “glanced” over and saw plaintiff setting up his stepladder and plaintiff’s eventual fall.', '- 41 - before a portion of his deposition testimony was read into the record, the following exchange occurred:', '“[Plaintiff Counsel]: * * * [W]hat, if anything, did you say to [Mr.', 'King] about straightening out the ladder?', '“[Mr. Weisensee]: I never said anything to him about it.', '“[Plaintiff Counsel]: Now, he was walking in harm’s way and you', 'said nothing?', '“* * *', '“[Mr. Weisensee]: I didn’t realize he was in harm’s way.', '“* * *', '“[Mr. Weisensee]: I said I didn’t realize at the time that he was', 'going to climb on it like that and fall down.', '“* * *', '“[Plaintiff Counsel]: Why was it that you didn’t warn Mr. King?', '“[Mr. Weisensee]: * * * I glanced up and I saw him setting up the', 'ladder and to me the way it looked like he was setting it up, it', 'didn’t look like it was straight up and then I just glanced back just', 'to do what I was doing.

On cross-examination, Mr. Weisensee was asked: “At the time that you glanced at [Mr. King] when you turned to your right, did you know that Mr. King was going to climb the ladder while it was [slanted]?” He replied: “No, I just saw him setting it up. I didn’t think that he -- I thought he would use his own sense and he would see what I saw, that it was slanted * * * .”', 'After an exhaustive review of the record in this case and particularly the testimony of Mr. Weisensee, it appears to us that Mr. Weisensee gave inconsistent testimony at trial and at his deposition regarding Mr. King’s fall and why he did not warn Mr. King about the slanted stepladder. We have repeatedly held that “neither a witness’s prior contradictory statements nor the inconsistencies in his testimony inhibit a fact finder’s right to accept the witness as credible,', '- 43 - and to pick and choose from his testimony what portions he deems worthy of belief.” Russian v.

It is clear that the above-quoted testimony of Mr. Weisensee, which was inconsistent with the portion of the testimony on which the trial justice relied, was not referred to in the trial justice’s decision. The only arguable reference comes in footnote two of the trial justice’s decision, where he states as follows:', '“Mr. Weisensee also suggests he did not see Mr. King go up the', 'ladder which is blatantly contradictory to the testimony he gave', 'weeks earlier. Such self-serving statements lack credibility.” This statement serves to further illustrate the trial justice’s error in not taking into account Mr. Weisensee’s testimony about not knowing that Mr. King was going to climb the stepladder; the trial justice discussed only the portions of Mr. Weisensee’s testimony that he deemed to be credible, overlooking the rest. In this Court’s judgment, members of the jury, acting in their capacity as fact-finders, were well within their discretion to credit certain portions of the contradictory testimony of Mr. Weisensee, even if the portions which they chose to find credible differed from those that the trial justice was inclined to find credible. See Russian, 103 R.I. at 464, 238 A.2d at 371.', 'By ignoring testimony which did not support his determination, the trial justice in the instant case overlooked material evidence in finding that reasonable jurors could not differ and', '- 44 - that the verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence. In the situation presented in this case, where there was inconsistent testimony from a specific witness some of which the jurors could have found to be credible and some of which the trial justice found to be credible, one simply cannot say that reasonable minds could not differ on the outcome of the case; thus, it is our judgment that in this case reasonable minds could, and did, differ.34 Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice committed clear error in granting plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. See 34', 'On June 30, 2011 (twenty-nine days after his June 1 decision on the motions for a new trial), the trial justice ruled on plaintiff’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. See Super. R. Civ. P. 50. The plaintiff contended that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count Two (negligence under the Jones Act). In the course of denying plaintiff’s motion, the trial justice stated:', '“Mr. King’s motion relies on the testimony of Mr.', 'Weisensee, who testified that he did not warn. However, Mr.', 'Weisensee’s credibility was very much in issue – which led to the', 'admission of his deposition testimony. Mr. Weisensee was a key', 'witness to the negligence.

If it is discounted', 'completely, Mr. King’s case is not as clear. Reasonable jurors', 'could have reached different conclusions concerning Mr.', 'Weisensee’s credibility and what actually happened as Mr. King', 'climbed the ladder.” We recognize that the trial justice, in ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law (rather than a motion for a new trial), was not authorized to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and was required to draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. See Oliveira v. Jacobson, 846 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2004). However, we note that the trial justice, when ruling on the motion for judgment as a matter of law, also did not reference Mr. Weisensee’s testimony at trial which tended to suggest that he did not see Mr. King climb the stepladder and did not warn Mr. King about the slanted stepladder because he did not know that he was going to climb the stepladder and fall.', 'The trial justice’s decision also emphasizes how crucial the credibility of Mr. Weisensee’s inconsistent testimony was to this case. We have held that, in such situations, it is the prerogative of the fact-finder to “pick and choose” which testimony it deems to be believable. Russian v. Lipet, 103 R.I. 461, 464, 238 A.2d 369, 371 (1968). The trial justice is not free to disregard the decision of the jurors simply because he would find different portions of the inconsistent testimony to be credible.', '- 45 - Botelho, 970 A.2d at 545 (“If the trial justice determines that the evidence is evenly balanced or is such that reasonable minds in considering the same evidence could come to different conclusions, the trial justice must allow the verdict to stand.”); see also Bajakian, 880 A.2d at 851; Marcotte v. Harrison, 443 A.2d 1225, 1232 (R.I. 1982).', 'In addition to overlooking material evidence, the trial justice also misconceived the evidence on which he did rely. He interpreted the statement of Mr. Weisensee on which he relied—namely, Mr. Weisensee’s deposition testimony that he did not care if a fellow crew member was injured—to mean that Mr. Weisensee, when he looked over and saw that Mr. King’s stepladder was slanted, “appreciated the risk” and made a conscious choice not to warn Mr. King about the apparent danger. However, that conclusion required a large inferential leap on the part of the trial justice. The statement itself reflects nothing more than a general lack of concern for the safety of his fellow crew members; Mr. Weisensee did not specifically state, that, because he generally lacks concern for their safety, he deliberately failed to warn Mr. King on May 31, 2006 that his stepladder was on a “slant.” Moreover, there is no testimony by Mr. Weisensee indicating that he knew that Mr. King would climb the stepladder and be at risk of injuring himself. It is clear to this Court that a jury could have heard the same statement as the one on which the trial justice relied and come to the conclusion that Mr. Weisensee did not knowingly opt not to warn Mr. King in this particular instance, leading us once again to the conclusion that reasonable minds could differ. See Botelho, 970 A.2d at 545. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the trial justice misconceived Mr. Weisensee’s testimony.', 'One final point supports our conclusion—namely, that the trial justice’s determination that Mr. Weisensee’s breach of the duty to warn was a proximate cause of the harm (which determination was also extrapolated from the same just-discussed small portion of Mr.', '- 46 - Weisensee’s deposition testimony on which the trial justice relied), was in error. Even though the threshold for proving proximate cause in a claim under the Jones Act is very low, the trial justice overlooked evidence that could indicate a different proximate cause for Mr. King’s fall and injury.

We refer to Mr. Reposa’s testimony that plaintiff was climbing the stepladder while holding a paintbrush and a container of paint.', 'Once again, depending on which testimony is deemed more credible, reasonable minds could certainly differ in determining what proximately caused Mr. King’s fall.', 'The varying testimony of Mr. Weisensee and the other witnesses at trial regarding the circumstances of plaintiff’s fall leads us to conclude that the trial justice’s determination that “Mr. Weisensee’s reluctance to warn had significant ramifications which the jury failed to appreciate” was without support and, thus, was clearly erroneous.', 'In view of the just-discussed incidents where the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence, it is clear to this Court that the trial justice committed clear error when he determined that the verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and granted plaintiff’s motion for a new trial on Counts Two and Three for negligence under the Jones Act and breach of the warranty of seaworthiness. Accordingly, we vacate the trial justice’s decision in that regard.', 'C', 'Prejudgment Interest', 'The last issue which defendant raises on appeal is its contention that, in ruling about the prejudgment interest issue, the trial justice erred when he relied upon Rhode Island’s prejudgment interest statute35 as opposed to the pertinent principles of federal maritime law. 35', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-21-10(a) reads as follows:', '- 47 - According to defendant, in an action based on federal maritime law, states may not apply their own substantive law when it is in conflict with substantive federal maritime law. The defendant contends that federal maritime law on prejudgment interest is substantive (not procedural) and that, therefore, the question of whether or not to award prejudgment interest (and how much, if any, to award) was one for the jury to determine. The defendant states: “[T]he trial judge’s decision to apply * * * Rhode Island’s prejudgment interest statute to plaintiff’s award is * * * without precedent in any state or federal court.” Additionally, defendant posits that it was improper for the trial justice to determine that defendant bore the burden of requesting that the question of whether or not to award prejudgment interest (and how much, if any, to award) be presented to the jury, rather than allocating that burden where defendant contends it belongs—namely, with plaintiff.', 'The plaintiff responds by contending that preemption (which is how plaintiff has chosen to characterize defendant’s argument) is an affirmative defense—which defendant failed to plead and, consequently, may not raise now. He further contends that any issue with respect to prejudgment interest was waived by defendant because defendant failed to object before the jury left the courtroom to begin deliberations. Finally, plaintiff avers that federal maritime law leaves the awarding of prejudgment interest to the discretion of the trial justice.', '“In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a', 'decision made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the', 'clerk of the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of', 'twelve percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of', 'action accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered', 'therein. Post-judgment interest shall be calculated at the rate of', 'twelve percent (12%) per annum and accrue on both the principal', 'amount of the judgment and the prejudgment interest entered', 'therein. This section shall not apply until entry of judgment or to', 'any contractual obligation where interest is already provided.”', '- 48 -', 'In our judgment the following explanation of the concept of prejudgment interest is particularly well articulated:', '“If justice were immediate, there would never be an award', 'of prejudgment interest.[] The injured party would receive an', 'enforceable judgment immediately, with no loss in value from the', 'time value of money. Because justice often takes many years to', 'achieve, interest is added to the original judgment to ensure that', 'compensation is complete.[] These calculations are ubiquitous,', 'since the laws of most U.S. jurisdictions provide for interest on', 'legal judgments from the time the claim arose until the date of', 'judgment.[] Such interest is called prejudgment interest.” Michael', 'S. Knoll, A Primer on Prejudgment Interest, 75 Tex. L. Rev. 293,', '294 (1996) (footnotes omitted).', 'The question before us with respect to prejudgment interest in the instant case is twofold. First, we must address whether or not the trial justice properly invoked Rhode Island statutory law relative to prejudgment interest or whether he should have applied federal maritime law. Second, (based on what will ultimately be our conclusion that the trial justice should have applied federal maritime law) we must address how the principles of federal maritime law with respect to prejudgment interest should have been applied in this case.', 'We begin our analysis with the question of whether state law or federal maritime law with respect to prejudgment interest should have been applied. The United States Supreme Court has held that the “savings to suitors clause,”36 which gives state courts jurisdiction (albeit not exclusive jurisdiction) over a federal maritime claim, “allows state courts to entertain in personam maritime causes of action, but in such cases the extent to which state law may be used to remedy maritime injuries is constrained by a so-called reverse-Erie doctrine which requires that the substantive remedies afforded by the States conform to governing federal maritime standards.”', 'Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U.S. 207, 222-23 (1986) (internal 36', 'The “savings to suitors clause” is set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1). See generally, Grant Gilmore & Charles L. Black, Jr., The Law of Admiralty, ch. I, § 1-13 at 37 (2d ed. 1975).', '- 49 - quotation marks omitted). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit likewise has stated: “It is well settled that by force of the Constitution itself, when a common law action is brought, whether in a state or in a federal court, to enforce a cause of action cognizable in admiralty, the substantive law to be applied is the same as would be applied in an admiralty court—that is, the general maritime law * * * .” Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc., 477 F.2d 1048, 1052-53 (1st Cir. 1973); see also Carey v. Bahama Cruise Lines, 864 F.2d 201, 207 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that states may not “modify or displace essential features of the substantive maritime law”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The principle which we draw from those cases is that, in an admiralty action in state court, issues which would be considered “substantive” are governed by federal maritime law. Therefore, if prejudgment interest is a substantive issue, then the trial justice in the instant case was required to apply federal maritime law, rather than Rhode Island statutory law.', 'We find guidance in our own jurisprudence, which, while not directly on point, provides some enlightenment as we endeavor to determine whether prejudgment interest is a substantive issue. In L.A. Ray Realty v. Town Council of Cumberland, 698 A.2d 202, 213-14 (R.I. 1997), this Court, applying federal law in an action based on 42 U.S.C. § 1983, stated that “federal courts in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 litigation generally view the availability of prejudgment interest as a question of federal law.” We proceeded to state as follows:', '“[S]tate law requirements may not be applied if their application', 'would contravene the purpose of a federal law or policy, or if', 'different outcomes would result depending on whether 42 U.S.C.', '§ 1983 claims were brought in federal or state court, thereby', 'thwarting the federal interest in uniformity. * * * Therefore, a state', 'limitation on the availability of prejudgment interest may not be', 'applied if such a limitation would contravene the goal of § 1983 to', 'fully compensate the injured party.” L.A. Ray Realty, 698 A.2d at', '214.', '- 50 -', 'The concerns which we expressed in L.A. Ray Realty with respect to “the federal interest in uniformity” and the goals of state and federal law are also present in this case. Federal maritime law leaves the issue of whether to award prejudgment interest (and in what amount, if any) to the discretion of the fact-finder (see infra). In contrast, Rhode Island’s statute with respect to prejudgment interest provides for the application of 12 percent interest by the clerk in any “civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision made for pecuniary damages;” it is a ministerial act which does not allow for any discretion by the judge or the jury. Section 9-21-10. Thus, applying state law in this context would result in “different outcomes”—depending on whether a particular federal admiralty action was brought in federal or state court. L.A. Ray Realty, 698 A.2d at 214; see Gilmore & Black, ch. I, § 1-17 at 48 (“[S]tate legislation is clearly invalid where it actually conflicts with the established general maritime law * * * .”); see also Carey, 864 F.2d at 207.', 'The real possibility of such “different outcomes” indicates that prejudgment interest should be considered a substantive issue, in order to provide uniformity and prevent forum shopping. On that point, we are in agreement with the following statement by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in reference to the issue of whether state or federal law should be applied in an admiralty case with respect to the awarding of prejudgment interest:', '“Maintaining disparate rules between the State and Federal', 'courts * * * would foster inconsistent results on a substantive', 'matter which often constitutes a considerable portion of the', 'damages recovered. In turn, the guarantee of prejudgment interest', 'to a successful plaintiff in a State court [as would be the case under', 'Massachusetts state law] would encourage forum shopping.”', 'Militello v. Ann & Grace, Inc., 576 N.E.2d 675, 679 (Mass. 1991);', 'see Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 468 (1965) (discussing Erie', 'Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938) and stating that “the', 'twin aims of the Erie rule [are] discouragement of forum-shopping', 'and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.”).', '- 51 - In addition to the application of state law resulting in a lack of uniformity and forum shopping, the goals of Rhode Island state law and federal maritime law with respect to awarding prejudgment interest are inconsistent; unlike the federal law, which leaves to the fact-finder the issue of whether or not prejudgment interest (and how much, if any, to award) is equitable in a particular case, one of the purposes of the Rhode Island state statute is to “encourag[e] the early settlement of claims.” Martin v. Lumbermen’s Mutual Casualty Co., 559 A.2d 1028, 1031 (R.I. 1989); see Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 930 (R.I. 1981). For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court’s precedent strongly suggests that prejudgment interest should be considered a substantive issue.', 'In addition, our review of federal case law and the case law from other jurisdictions clearly indicates that prejudgment interest has been considered to be a substantive issue by numerous courts. We first note that, although it has not specifically addressed prejudgment interest in the context of an admiralty action, we find some helpful guidance in the teachings of the United States Supreme Court; it has held that the “proper measure of damages is inseparably connected with the right of action,” suggesting that any issues relating to damages are substantive. Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. Kelly, 241 U.S. 485, 491 (1916). The First Circuit has specifically held that any issue which affected the “amount of damages” was substantive and required the application of federal law. Robinson, 477 F.2d at 1053 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Robinson v. Watts Detective Agency, Inc., 685 F.2d 729, 741 (1st Cir. 1982) (“Because Count I of the complaint stated a cause of action arising under [a federal] Act, whether or not the trustee is entitled to prejudgment interest as an element of damages is a matter of federal law.”). The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has similarly stated: “Federal and State courts agree that because it concerns a substantive remedy,[] the questions', '- 52 - whether to, and who may, award prejudgment interest are governed by the Federal maritime law and not State law.” Militello, 576 N.E.2d at 678 (footnote omitted). Indeed, numerous scholarly writings have echoed the just-referenced holdings of the First Circuit and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. See, e.g., Norman M. Stockman, Admiralty Law for the Land-Side Alabama Lawyer, 71 Ala. Law. 296, 303 (2010) (“[T]he availability of prejudgment interest is a matter of substantive admiralty law.”); Michael F. Sturley & David C. Frederick, Prejudgment Interest in Seaman’s Personal Injury Cases: Supreme Court Precedent Lost in a Sea of Procedural Confusion, 33 J. Mar. L. & Com. 423, 427 (2002) (“The awarding of prejudgment interest has long been held * * * to be part of the substantive law applied by the trial court * * * .”).', 'After careful consideration of the state of the law with respect to prejudgment interest in an admiralty action, we now hold that in such an action prejudgment interest is a substantive issue. Accordingly, it was error for the trial justice to apply Rhode Island state law on such a substantive issue. The trial justice should have applied federal maritime law. In order to provide clarity with respect to this somewhat complicated issue, we proceed by discussing what federal maritime law demands with respect to prejudgment interest.', 'As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, “[t]hroughout our history, admiralty decrees have included provisions for prejudgment interest.” City of Milwaukee v. Cement Division, National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S. 189, 194 (1995); see also The Amiable Nancy, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 546, 562-63 (1818) (augmenting the damages awarded by a lower court and directing that the additional funds bear prejudgment interest); Del Col v. Arnold, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 333, 334 (1796) (affirming a decree which provided for interest from “the day of capture”). However, as plaintiff recognizes, there is no consensus among the federal circuits as to the type of admiralty', '- 53 - cases which are eligible for the awarding of prejudgment interest, who is responsible for determining if prejudgment interest should be awarded, and who has the discretion to determine how much prejudgment interest is to be awarded. See 80 A.L.R. Fed. Recovery of Prejudgment Interest in Actions under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act or Jones Act 185, § 11, § 15 at 217, 226 (1986) (recognizing that some courts allow prejudgment interest to be awarded in actions under the Jones Act and some do not); see, e.g., Jones v. Spentonbush-Red Star Co., 155 F.3d 587, 593 (2d Cir. 1998) (stating that “pre-judgment interest should be awarded in admiralty cases absent exceptional circumstances”); Wyatt v. Penrod Drilling Co., 735 F.2d 951, 956 (5th Cir. 1984) (stating that prejudgment interest may not be awarded on a claim under the Jones Act, but may be awarded on a “maritime claim”); Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc., 477 F.2d 1048, 1053 (1st Cir. 1973) (holding that the jury has discretion as to whether or not to award prejudgment interest in an admiralty action); 2 Am.Jur.2d Admiralty § 215 at 694 (2004) (stating that “[a] court has discretion to award prejudgment interest in an admiralty case”).37 In our judgment, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit articulated the most sensible approach in Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc., 477 F.2d 1048, 1052-53 (1st Cir. 1973), and it is that approach which this Court will follow.', 'In Robinson, the court was confronted with an action brought by an injured seaman against the company which chartered the vessel on which he was injured; the action was brought under the Jones Act and also included claims for “unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure under the general maritime law.” Id. at 1049. The company that chartered the vessel argued on 37', 'The lack of uniformity with respect to the awarding of prejudgment interest in a federal maritime action has been noted in admiralty scholarship.

Id. at 1052. After holding that federal law must be applied on the issue of prejudgment interest, the First Circuit proceeded to hold that prejudgment interest in a federal maritime action is properly left to the discretion of the jury. Id. at 1052-53; see also Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, 922 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1990) (“There can be no doubt that in this circuit the decision to award prejudgment interest in a federal question case lies within the sole province and discretion of the jury.”). Even though the plaintiff had included “demands for interest in his complaint,” since the award of prejudgment interest was in the jury’s discretion and “[the plaintiff] did not request that the jury be instructed that it might, in its discretion, add pre-judgment interest to its award,” the court modified the trial justice’s judgment by “striking out the award of pre-judgment interest.” Robinson, 477 F.2d at 1053.', 'We further note that the holding of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in its decision in Militello, 576 N.E.2d at 678-79, was substantially similar to the holding of the First Circuit in Robinson.38 In Militello, the court held, that “in an action * * * in which both Jones Act and unseaworthiness claims are tried before a jury, the questions whether to award prejudgment interest, and at what rate, are to be decided by the jury.” Id. at 678. The court further held that, “[b]ecause the plaintiff in this case did not correctly pursue prejudgment interest [in the form of a jury award], he may not now recover it.” Id. at 679. We are in agreement with the holdings in Robinson and Militello. 38', 'The plaintiff’s attempt to distinguish Militello v. Ann & Grace, Inc., 576 N.E.2d 675, 679 (Mass. 1991), by arguing that in that case the defendant requested a jury instruction on prejudgment interest before the jury retired to deliberate is unavailing. The defendant in the instant case did not have the burden of requesting such a jury instruction; that burden was unquestionably plaintiff’s.', '- 55 -', 'The plaintiff avers that defendant, by not requesting a jury instruction until after the jurors left the courtroom to deliberate, thereby waived any contention that the issue of prejudgment interest should have been presented to the jury.39 We find that assertion to fly in the face of both common sense and the foundational principles of our adversary system; requiring defendant to ask for a jury instruction which could ultimately lead to that same defendant being required to pay an even higher damages award to plaintiff is, in our estimation, more than quixotic; that approach would be utterly inconsistent with the traditional thesis-antithesis method which characterizes the Anglo-American litigation process. It was plaintiff who would have benefited from prejudgment interest on any jury award in his favor; it logically follows that it was plaintiff who was responsible for requesting a jury instruction with respect to prejudgment interest.

OPINION Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this appeal, we revisit an ongoing dispute between two commercial landowners over the existence of a prescriptive easement used by delivery trucks to access a loading dock. The plaintiffs, Butterfly Realty and Dairyland, Inc. (plaintiffs), appeal from a Superior Court judgment denying their claim for a prescriptive easement on the property of the defendant, James Romanella & Sons, Inc. (JR & Sons or defendant). This case came before the Supreme Court on December 10, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing their written submissions, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel The facts of this case were previously discussed in this Court’s recent opinion, Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584 (R.I. 2012) (hereinafter, Butterfly I). In -1- that decision, we vacated a judgment in favor of defendant and remanded the matter to the Superior Court. Upon remand, the parties waived the presentation of additional evidence. Accordingly, the facts provided in this opinion come from the one and only trial conducted in this case. We briefly recount below those facts relevant to the instant appeal. The property at the center of this dispute consists of three commercial lots located in the Town of Westerly where East Avenue meets Granite Street and which are identified on assessor’s plat No. 77 as lots Nos. 330, 331, and 332. JR & Sons owns the most southerly of the three parcels, lot No. 330, which has frontage on East Avenue. At all times relevant to this appeal, a commercial building containing a laundromat has occupied the northern portion of lot No. 330. Lot No. 331, which is owned by Dairyland, Inc., lies immediately to the north of lot No. 330 and has frontage on Granite Street. Lot No. 332 sits immediately to the north of lot No. 331 and also has frontage on Granite Street. On August 8, 1985, Albert Romanella, then- president of JR & Sons, conveyed lot No. 332 by warranty deed to Butterfly Realty (Butterfly). That same day, Albert Romanella also assigned his lease for lot No. 331 to Butterfly. Butterfly owns a single commercial building that occupies most of lots Nos. 331 and 332. 1 The southwestern corner of the building houses a loading dock, the door to which faces southward towards JR & Sons’s lot. Because the building sits nearly on top of the boundary line between lots Nos. 331 and 330, delivery trucks cannot access the loading dock without entering onto JR & Sons’s property. Accordingly, on August 16, 1985, JR & Sons granted Butterfly an express easement, recorded in the Town of Westerly’s land evidence records, which “permit[s] ingress and egress to and from the loading dock at the southwest corner of [Butterfly’s] building[.]” The terms of the easement, however, expressly prohibit deliveries by “semi- 1 Part of the southwest corner of the building actually encroaches upon JR & Sons’s lot No. 330. -2- trailers.” The southern boundary of the easement runs roughly parallel to the side of Butterfly’s building and becomes wider as it moves from east to west. From 1985 onward, Butterfly’s building housed a succession of businesses, all of which made some use of the loading dock. A liquor store operated out of the building from 1985 to 1989. After the liquor store vacated the premises, Butterfly leased a portion of the building to an auto parts store. From 1993 through 2010, another tenant of Butterfly’s, Auto Audio, also operated a business out of a different portion of the building. The various businesses received deliveries from trucks of different sizes and with differing frequencies. In general, however, the delivery trucks would drive over JR & Sons’s lot, beyond the bounds of the express easement, to access the loading dock. In May 2010, JR & Sons hired an engineer to determine the precise location of the express easement’s southern boundary after a delivery truck damaged a building on JR & Sons’s lot. JR & Sons then ordered the installation of “concrete pylons” along the southwestern boundary of the express easement. With the pylons in place, it was nearly impossible for delivery vehicles to directly access the loading dock. On June 14, 2010, Butterfly 2 responded by filing a complaint in Washington County Superior Court, claiming a prescriptive easement over JR & Sons’s lot. 3 The defendant filed a counterclaim for a permanent injunction to compel Butterfly to comply with the terms of the express easement. A two-day bench trial on the parties’ claims commenced on December 8, 2010. The testimony and exhibits presented at trial indicated that delivery trucks typically used one of two routes to access the loading dock. These two paths were referred to as the “brown route” and the 2 A later amended complaint included Dairyland, Inc. as a plaintiff. 3 Butterfly and Dairyland also filed claims for an implied easement, an easement by necessity, an easement by implication, an easement by acquiescence, and adverse possession. The only claim before the Court in the instant appeal is plaintiffs’ claim for a prescriptive easement. -3- “green route” at trial. See Appendix. 4 When following the brown route, a truck would enter lot No. 330 from a curb cut on East Avenue and then drive westward, in between the laundromat and the Butterfly building, before making a left turn behind the laundromat. The delivery truck would then back up to the loading dock. When using the green route, a delivery truck would enter lot No. 331 from a curb cut on Granite Street, then drive southwestward across several painted parking spaces, 5 and cross onto lot No. 330, where it would continue along the brown route to reach the loading dock. At trial, both parties presented several witnesses who testified about the delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s lot. We summarize below the relevant testimony. 6 Shawn Martin, a part-owner of Butterfly, testified on behalf of plaintiffs. He explained that his partner, an attorney, had negotiated the exact terms of the express easement in 1985 but stated that he “roughly” understood where the boundaries of the express easement were located. According to Mr. Martin, neither Albert Romanella nor Albert Romanella’s partner, Charles Sposato, had ever voiced any objections about the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. The plaintiff also presented Mr. Martin’s wife, Rita Martin, who managed the liquor store from the time it opened in 1985 until the time it closed in 1989. During the many hours that she spent at the store, Mrs. Martin personally observed trucks make deliveries to the loading dock. She estimated that the liquor store received approximately twelve to fifteen deliveries per week. Mrs. Martin further estimated that the trucks’ use of the brown and green routes was either roughly equal or that the brown route received slightly more use than the green route. She indicated that she had never received any written or oral communications from anyone affiliated 4 An engineering drawing, appended to this opinion, depicts the “brown” and “green” routes testified to at trial. The express easement appears on the drawing as a dotted line. 5 Some of the parking spaces actually straddle the boundary line between lots Nos. 330 and 331. 6 Three pretrial depositions were additionally admitted into evidence as full exhibits. -4- with JR & Sons about the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. Mrs. Martin testified that she and her husband had a “friendly relationship” with Mr. Sposato. Mrs. Martin explained that, for approximately one month each year, one or more tenants of JR & Sons would sell Christmas trees alongside the northern exterior wall of the laundromat. She testified that the actual dimensions of the area occupied by the trees would vary slightly from one year to another. Nonetheless, according to her recollection, the trees never impeded the trucks’ abilities to make deliveries. Paul Williams also testified on plaintiffs’ behalf. Mr. Williams worked in the auto parts store from 1991, approximately two years after the store opened, until 2006. 7 He explained that the auto parts store usually received deliveries at the loading dock on a weekly basis. According to Mr. Williams, those deliveries arrived by semi-trailer trucks which were approximately fifty feet in length. He also testified that sometimes a garbage truck would pick up trash from the loading dock or a United Postal Service (UPS) truck would deliver a large item to the loading dock. Mr. Williams estimated that the delivery trucks’ use of the brown and green routes was roughly equal, but he clarified that a truck driver’s ability to use the green route depended on whether cars were parked in the parking spaces located southeast of Butterfly’s building. See Appendix. Mr. Williams testified that the annual Christmas tree sales did not prevent the delivery trucks from entering through the curb cut on East Avenue and reaching the loading dock. 7 The record is somewhat vague concerning delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 during the time period from 1989 to 1991. As we explained in our previous opinion, this ambiguity is not necessarily fatal to plaintiffs’ claim because the time from 1991 forward could satisfy the statutory ten-year period for a prescriptive easement. See Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584, 587 n.2 (R.I. 2012) -5- The plaintiffs’ final witness was Craig Jackson, the owner of Auto Audio. Mr. Jackson testified that he personally supervised about half of Auto Audio’s deliveries. According to Mr. Jackson, UPS trucks made deliveries to the loading dock about twice per day and used both the brown and green routes. Approximately once every two weeks, a garbage truck would use the loading dock to pick up both Auto Audio’s and the auto parts store’s trash. Consistent with Mr. Williams’s testimony, Mr. Jackson testified that he observed semi-trailer trucks accessing the loading dock on a weekly basis to make deliveries to the auto parts store. He confirmed that the average size of the area occupied by the Christmas trees varied from year to year but maintained that the only time he could recall deliveries being impeded is when the concrete pylons were installed in 2010. Charles Sposato, a 50 percent owner of JR & Sons, testified for defendant. In a deposition submitted into evidence at trial, Mr. Sposato stated that he was unaware of the exact location of the express easement until May 2010 when the survey was completed. Mr. Sposato further indicated in his deposition that he had previously believed that Albert Romanella had an oral, rather than a written, agreement with Butterfly that delivery trucks were allowed to cross over JR & Sons’s property to reach the loading dock. Accordingly, he testified at trial that he was surprised in May 2010 when he saw for the first time the deed granting Butterfly an express easement. He insisted that, since 1985, he had consistently believed that Butterfly should pay for its use of JR & Sons’s lot. Approximately twenty-five years ago, he expressed this belief to Albert Romanella. After Albert Romanella passed away in 2004, Mr. Sposato considered requesting that Butterfly pay rent but ultimately did not approach anyone from Butterfly at that time. He did not demand rent from anyone at Butterfly until approximately six months before trial when he telephoned Paul Martin, Shawn Martin’s brother. According to Mr. Sposato’s -6- recounting of the telephone conversation, he requested that Butterfly pay $900 per month for its tenants’ use of lot No. 330. According to Mr. Sposato, delivery trucks had more than once caused damage to JR & Sons’s property. On those occasions, Mr. Sposato spoke directly with the drivers of the trucks, but he did not tell anyone from Butterfly, Dairyland, or the auto parts store that the delivery trucks could no longer use JR & Sons’s lot. When asked at trial why he never forbade the delivery trucks from entering upon JR & Sons’s property, Mr. Sposato explained, “I just wanted to be a good neighbor I guess. I just never did.” Mr. Sposato also testified about his personal observations of the delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s lot. He indicated that, since 1995, he has visited JR & Sons’s property on a daily basis, except for several weeks each year that he spends in Florida. During his time at the property, Mr. Sposato personally observed semi-trailer trucks making deliveries to the loading dock. According to Mr. Sposato, the trucks mostly used the brown route. He clarified, however, that there are “many different trucks that come [into] this property. They are not all trailer trucks. They don’t all use that brown [route] at all. * * * They come in our property * * * all ways that I have noticed.” Mr. Sposato recalled a dozen or more instances when he had moved his car to accommodate the delivery trucks. He explained that the truck drivers did not ask him to move his car, but he would voluntarily do so if he noticed that the trucks were holding up traffic. Mr. Sposato confirmed that the Christmas tree sales took place on the northern side of the laundromat almost every year from 1985 to 2006 and lasted from approximately Thanksgiving through December 23 or 24. -7- James Romanella also testified for defendant. James 8 served as vice president of JR & Sons until 2004, when he became president. He recalled a telephone conversation that he had with the manager of the auto parts store about the Christmas trees. According to James’s recounting of the conversation, the manager was concerned that the size of the area occupied by the trees was making it difficult for the delivery trucks to reach the loading dock. In response, James suggested that the delivery drivers use smaller trucks. He also informed the manager that the tree sales “would continue as long as [his] tenant wanted to do it.” James had no recollection of when this conversation occurred other than that it had taken place sometime between 1985 and 2005. The trial justice denied plaintiffs’ claim for a prescriptive easement in a written decision filed on March 18, 2011. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. In an opinion issued on June 27, 2012, we concluded that the trial justice had committed an error of law because he “inappropriately required Butterfly’s tenants’ use of the disputed land to be inconsistent with JR & Sons’s use * * *.” Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 589. Accordingly, we vacated the trial justice’s decision and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Id. at 592. We additionally instructed that on remand the trial justice should address certain inconsistent findings he had made with regard to the Christmas trees’ impact on Butterfly’s continuous use of the prescriptive easement. Id. at 591. Finally, we directed the trial justice to determine whether the various tenants’ use of lot No. 330 could be imputed to Butterfly for the purposes of establishing a prescriptive easement. Id. at 591-92. Upon remand and after the parties waived the presentation of additional evidence, the trial justice issued a second written decision on November 9, 2012 in which he again denied 8 To avoid confusion, we refer to James Romanella by his first name. In so doing, we intend no disrespect. -8- plaintiffs’ claim for a prescriptive easement. In his second decision, the trial justice found that the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 was actual, open, and notorious. He concluded, however, that such use was not sufficiently hostile to establish an easement by prescription. According to the trial justice, JR & Sons had given permission for the delivery trucks to traverse its lot in order to access the Butterfly building’s loading dock. He also concluded that the Christmas tree sales had interrupted the continuous use of the disputed area. The trial justice did not address whether the various tenants’ use of lot No. 330 could be imputed to Butterfly. Judgment entered on November 20, 2012. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court. Additional facts will be provided, as needed, to resolve the issues raised on appeal. II Standard of Review We afford “much deference to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil case.” DiPippo v. Sperling, 63 A.3d 503, 507 (R.I. 2013) (quoting McGarry v. Coletti, 33 A.3d 140, 144 (R.I. 2011)). We will not disturb the trial justice’s factual findings “unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.” Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 68 A.3d 425, 433-34 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009)). “If the trial justice’s decision ‘reasonably indicates that [he or she] exercised [his or her] independent judgment in passing on the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses it will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly wrong or otherwise incorrect as a matter of law.’” Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 86 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Now Courier, LLC v. Better Carrier Corp., 965 A.2d 429, 434 (R.I. 2009)). Furthermore, the trial justice may “draw inferences from the testimony of witnesses, and such -9- inferences, if reasonable, are entitled on review to the same weight as other factual determinations.” Id. (quoting DeSimone Electric, Inc. v. CMG, Inc., 901 A.2d 613, 621 (R.I. 2006)). In contrast, “we review de novo the trial justice’s conclusions of law.” Greensleeves, 68 A.3d at 434 (citing State v. Gianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 2011)). III Discussion A few years ago, this Court observed that the “ancient roots and arcane rationale” of prescriptive land rights have become increasingly difficult to “square[] with modern ideals in a sophisticated, congested, peaceful society.” Cahill, 11 A.3d at 88, 87 (quoting Finley v. Yuba County Water District, 160 Cal.Rptr. 423, 427 (Cal. Ct. App. 1979)). Although claims for adverse possession and prescriptive servitudes have continuing vitality in this jurisdiction, our jurisprudence on prescriptive rights in recent years has charted a consistent path by showing solicitude for the rights of record owners, and, correspondingly, guarding against the potential for uncompensated loss by holding claimants to a high burden of proof. See Drescher v. Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218, 1227 (R.I. 2012); Cahill, 11 A.3d at 88; see also Pelletier v. Laureanno, 46 A.3d 28, 35-36 (R.I. 2012) (rejecting claim for easement appurtenant). A claimant of an easement by prescription “must show actual, open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use under a claim of right for at least ten years.” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1227 (quoting Hilley v. Lawrence, 972 A.2d 643, 651-52 (R.I. 2009)). A plaintiff claiming an easement is held to a higher standard of proof than a plaintiff in an ordinary civil case. Pelletier, 46 A.3d at 35. He or she bears the heavy burden of proving “each element by a preponderance of clear and convincing evidence.” Carpenter v. Hanslin, 900 A.2d 1136, 1146 (R.I. 2006); see also Hilley, - 10 - 972 A.2d at 652 (each element for a prescriptive easement must be proven by “clear and satisfactory evidence”). Any analysis of a claim for a prescriptive right must take for its point of origin the principle that such rights “are not favored in the law, * * * since they necessarily work corresponding losses or forfeitures on the rights of other persons[.]” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1227 (quoting 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses § 39 at 536 (2004)); Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 592 n.8 (stating same). “The burdens of prescription * * * fall onto the shoulders of the subservient estate.” William G. Ackerman & Shane T. Johnson, Outlaws of the Past: A Western Perspective on Prescription and Adverse Possession, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. 79, 92 (1996). Those burdens include the “infringement of a landowner’s rights, a decrease in value of the servient estate, * * * the generation of animosity between neighbors, a source of damages to land * * * and the creation of uncertainty for the landowner.” Cahill, 11 A.3d at 87-88 (quoting Ackerman, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. at 92). These foundational principles are equally applicable when the holder of an express easement seeks to expand that easement by prescription. An attempt by the holder of an express easement to unilaterally “expand the physical size, purpose or use of the easement beyond the terms as contained in the original grant * * * unduly interferes with the reserved rights of the owner of the servient tenement.” 28A C.J.S. Easements § 231 at 449 (2008). In cases such as this one where the easement holder seeks to change not only the frequency or type of use, but also the dimensions of an express easement, the enlargement “‘does more than merely increase the burden upon the servient estate; it has the effect of enveloping additional land,’”—land which the owner has purposely reserved for him or herself. Northwest Pipeline Corp. v. Luna, - 11 - 241 P.3d 945, 948 (Idaho 2010). Here, Butterfly seeks to expand a limited express easement into an amorphous prescriptive easement that will envelop nearly the entirety of JR & Sons’s lot. 9 An enlargement of an express easement by prescription must satisfy all the traditional requirements for acquiring a prescriptive right. See Jon W. Bruce & James W. Ely, Jr., The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land, § 8:16 (2014). 10 In the instant case, the trial justice found that Butterfly had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that its use was hostile to the record owner or that it was continuous for the statutory period. Butterfly challenges both of these findings on appeal. Before turning our attention, however, to the merits of the trial justice’s analysis of the element of hostility, we briefly address plaintiff’s threshold contention that the trial justice was prohibited upon remand from performing any analysis of the element of hostility. 9 Despite the designation of the “brown” and “green” routes, the witnesses’ collective testimony at trial clearly indicated that trucks took all different paths to navigate around the maze of cars, Christmas trees, buildings, and other obstacles that from time to time littered this small parking lot. Accordingly, although Butterfly attempts to confine its claimed easement to the “brown” and “green” routes, the reality is that every time a large truck tries to navigate those pathways and finds a car or other obstacle in its way, it will stray from the designated routes and envelop even more of JR & Sons’s property. Granting such an easement would be difficult to square with “this Court’s obligation to create the least burdensome easement possible[.]” Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 839 (R.I. 2001) (Goldberg, J., dissenting). 10 It has been said that “[e]nlargement by prescription of an express easement is rare” due to “a lack of the elements necessary to create it.” Turner v. Bouchard, 32 A.3d 527, 534 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2011) (quoting Annot. 110 A.L.R. 915, 916 (1937)). For example, in a case factually similar to the one presently before this Court, a commercial landowner had an express easement, dating back to 1910, over part of the neighboring defendant’s property to allow trucks to access a loading dock. Mensch v. Netty, 408 N.W.2d 383, 384 (Iowa 1987). Modern-sized trucks and semi-trailers, however, could not back up to the loading dock within the narrow bounds of the express easement and therefore began to encroach farther onto the defendant’s land. See id. at 384-85. After a truck damaged the defendant’s building, the defendant refused to permit the trucks to continue to use his land to reach the loading dock. See id. at 385. Consequently, the plaintiff sought to establish that he had acquired a prescriptive easement for the additional footage. See id. The Iowa Supreme Court held that the plaintiff could not meet his burden of proof on the element of hostility because “[t]he fact that truck drivers had used the additional space to enter the alley at most shows permissive use.” Id. at 387. - 12 - A Scope of Remand According to Butterfly, the trial justice exceeded the scope of this Court’s remand by revisiting the element of hostility. Butterfly argues that this Court had “already ruled that the trial justice had applied an incorrect legal standard in determining whether Butterfly had proven hostility, and did not invite the trial justice to revisit this element of proof.” 11 As we have explained, “lower courts * * * that receive our remand orders may not exceed the scope of the remand or open up the proceeding to legal issues beyond the remand.” Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 960 A.2d 216, 223 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Willis v. Wall, 941 A.2d 163, 166 (R.I. 2008)). “When a case has been once decided by this [C]ourt on appeal, and remanded to the [Superior Court], * * * [the Superior Court] * * * cannot * * * intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.” Id. (quoting United States v. Thrasher, 483 F.3d 977, 981 (9th Cir. 2007)). We see no reason why our conclusion in Butterfly I that the trial justice made an error of law would prohibit the trial justice from revisiting the element of hostility. To the contrary, our previous opinion stated that the trial justice’s “misapplication of law sufficiently tainted the balance of [his] decision, including any factual determinations.” Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 590. We therefore conclude that the trial justice was not only authorized but indeed was intended upon remand to apply the correct legal standard to the facts to make a second determination as to whether Butterfly had proven hostile use. 11 Butterfly additionally suggests that the trial justice based his second decision on a legal theory that was never argued. The record belies this assertion because JR & Sons argued permission from the outset of this case. In his opening statement on the first day of trial, JR & Sons’s counsel took the position that Butterfly’s use was permissive. - 13 - B Hostility In his second decision, the trial justice found that Butterfly could not meet its burden of proof on the element of hostility because its delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s property was permissive. The claimant of an easement by prescription bears the burden of proving by clear and satisfactory evidence that his or her use was adverse to that of the record owner. To demonstrate hostile use, the claimant must show use “without permission asked or given * * * such as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228 (quoting Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003)). On the issue of permission, this Court long ago articulated the relevant rule as follows: “It is the well settled rule that use by expressed or implied permission or license, no matter how long continued, cannot ripen into an easement by prescription, since one of the elements essential to the acquisition of the easement, namely, user as of right, as distinguished from permissive use, is lacking.” Tefft v. Reynolds, 43 R.I. 538, 542-43, 113 A. 787, 789 (1921). Since this pronouncement in Tefft, this Court has continuously acknowledged that express or implied permission defeats a claim for a prescriptive right. See Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1019 (R.I. 1999) (distinguishing landowner’s “express or implied permission,” which will defeat a claimed easement, from landowner’s mere awareness, which will not); cf. Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 834 (R.I. 2001) (concluding that “permission, express or implied, was never given” for claimant’s use of landowner’s property). For a landowner who wishes to be an accommodating neighbor without creating a permanent burden on his or her land, “[t]he easiest remedy * * * is to give [the adverse user] permission to continue the use * * *. This effectively eliminates the adverse individual’s claim immediately.” Ackerman, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. at 95. One of the most well-recognized - 14 - dangers of prescriptive easements is their tendency to “discourage[] neighborly conduct and accommodation. Landowners are required either to formalize permissive arrangements, or to prevent use by others to avoid the risk that rights will be established by prescription.” Restatement (Third) Servitudes, § 2.17 cmt. c at 265-66 (2000). The more formal a reviewing court requires that permission to be, the greater the uncertainty for the landowner. See Ackerman, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. at 95. While this Court has required something more than silent acquiescence to show that a use was permissive, see Burke-Tarr Co., 724 A.2d at 1019, a landowner need not formally or expressly grant a user permission since “[p]ermission sufficient to preclude a claim for a prescriptive easement * * * may be inferred from surrounding circumstances.” 28A C.J.S. Easements § 45 at 245 (2008); see Burke-Tarr Co., 724 A.2d at 1019 (acknowledging that “an inference of permissive use * * * would defeat the element of hostile use”). For example, in Drescher, this Court concluded that a claimant’s use of a right-of-way was permissive, where the facts and circumstances supported an inference that the claimant’s use was pursuant to a “‘perceived invitation.’” 12 Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228-29 (emphasis added); see also Daniels v. Blake, 81 R.I. 103, 109, 99 A.2d 7, 11 (1953) (“friendly relations between respondent and complainants while the latter were openly using the strip to pass to and from the shore * * * tends to establish their use originally as merely permissive”). Even where the issue of permission is raised, the burden is never on the landowner to demonstrate that the use was permissive. See Altieri v. Dolan, 423 A.2d 482, 483 (R.I. 1980). 12 In Drescher v. Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218 (R.I. 2012), we additionally concluded that the trial justice appropriately considered the fact that neighbors and individuals other than the claimant had accessed the landowner’s property while under the “impression” that their use was permissive. See id. at 1229. We held that these facts in Drescher supported an inference of permission sufficient to defeat the claimed easement despite the fact that the permission was “illusionary” rather than actual. Id. - 15 - The burden at all times remains on the claimant to establish adverse use by strict proof. See id. “The determination of whether the claimant [of a prescriptive right] sustained this burden of proof involves an exercise by the trial justice of his factfinding power.” Jerry Brown Farm Association, Inc. v. Kenyon, 119 R.I. 43, 52, 375 A.2d 964, 968-69 (1977); see Hazard v. East Hills, Inc., 45 A.3d 1262, 1271 (R.I. 2012) (claims for prescriptive rights are “fact-intensive inquir[ies]”). Accordingly, the deference that this Court affords the trial justice is at its zenith. Even if more than one inference may be drawn from the record, we are bound to uphold the trial justice’s inferences so long as they are reasonable. Jerry Brown Farm Association, Inc., 119 R.I. at 51, 375 A.2d at 968. We conclude that the record in this case supports the trial justice’s reasonable inference that Butterfly’s use of JR & Sons’s lot was permissive. Viewing the record from the proper deferential perspective, the testimony demonstrated that Charles Sposato—unaware of the boundaries of the express easement—begrudgingly allowed Butterfly to use his property for nearly twenty-five years, due, at least in part, to his belief that Albert Romanella had given oral permission for Butterfly’s trucks to traverse JR & Sons’s lot. Mr. Sposato consciously refrained from requesting any compensation from Butterfly for those twenty-five years. Since Mr. Sposato apparently believed that Butterfly had already received an explicit oral grant of permission from Albert Romanella to use JR & Sons’s lot, he could not reasonably be expected to have given Butterfly another express or formal grant of permission. Nor does the law require him to have done so. JR & Sons’s behavior did, however, go beyond mere tolerance and awareness. Mr. Sposato and James Romanella took affirmative steps consistent with an inference of permission. Mr. Sposato moved his car to allow the trucks - 16 - access to the loading dock. 13 When the manager of the auto parts store called to complain about the Christmas trees, James Romanella did not prohibit the trucks from entering while the trees were in place but instead responded by insisting that the trucks’ use of the lot must remain subservient to his tenants’ use of the lot. When his building was struck in 2001 and again in 2004, James had two separate conversations with Paul Martin, in which Mr. Martin apologized and promised James on each occasion that it would not happen again. After these conversations, James continued to allow Butterfly’s trucks to use JR & Sons’s property for nearly another six years. Mr. Sposato explained that he never forbade the delivery trucks to enter JR & Sons’s lot because he was trying to be a good neighbor. This series of interactions adequately supports the trial justice’s conclusion that JR & Sons “permitted the use to continue” by giving its “assent, accompanied with various restrictions, [to] control[] the use of the area.” Such actions go beyond the “inactive status of quiescence or unqualified submission” which we have previously found insufficient to support an inference of permission. Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832-33 (quoting Garrett v. Gray, 266 A.2d 21, 27-28 (Md. 1970)). The trial justice therefore correctly concluded that Butterfly had not met its burden of clearly and convincingly proving its claim for a prescriptive easement. “A prescriptive easement cannot be established if permission to use the property can be inferred where the relationship between the parties is one of neighborly cooperation and accommodation.” 28A C.J.S. Easements § 45 at 245. The element of “hostility” does not refer to the emotional 13 Although Mr. Sposato’s testimony about moving his car is difficult to follow, he explained that sometimes Butterfly’s delivery trucks would enter JR & Sons’s property south of the laundromat. The trucks would then reverse direction in front of his office and back up to the loading dock, passing roughly in between the office and the rear of the laundromat. Since Mr. Sposato’s car was parked near the southwest corner of the laundromat, he would occasionally have to move it to allow the delivery trucks sufficient room to maneuver. On the appendix, JR & Sons’s office appears as a building marked “1 st[or]y masonry plaza.” - 17 - temperature of the neighbors’ relationship. See Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 589. Thus, the fact that Mr. Sposato and James Romanella may have accommodated Butterfly’s trucks with less than enthusiasm and alacrity does not turn a permissive use into a hostile one. 14 After their building was damaged one time too many, Mr. Sposato and James Romanella investigated the boundaries of the express easement in May 2010 and decided that they would no longer permit Butterfly’s uncompensated use of JR & Sons’s property beyond those boundaries. Accordingly, they asked for monthly rent and installed the pylons, which actions prompted Butterfly to file suit almost immediately. JR & Sons’s revocation of permission does not suffice to prove hostility. If it did, a landowner such as JR & Sons who has previously permitted someone to use his or her property would be placed in the untenable position of either allowing the use to continue indefinitely or revoking permission and suffering the imposition of a permanent burden on his or her property. Under our law, a landowner who has previously permitted a neighbor to use his or her land is entitled to withdraw that permission without forfeiting his or her property rights. See Hilley, 972 A.2d at 652 (where use of easement was permissive until such time as landowner withdrew permission, user who filed suit immediately after revocation of permission could not establish claim to a prescriptive easement). Accordingly, JR & Sons was free to end Butterfly’s use of its lot, and its previous cooperation does not work a forfeiture of its rights. In sum, we are satisfied that, in his second decision, the trial justice gave an accurate recitation of the law on hostility and drew a reasonable inference that Butterfly’s delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s lot was permissive. Since Butterfly cannot succeed on its claim for a 14 We note that there was testimony from both Mr. Sposato and Mrs. Martin that their relationship, at least prior to May 2010, was friendly and neighborly. On appeal, we are required to afford “substantial deference” to a trial justice’s decision to credit a witness’s testimony. Pelletier v. Laureanno, 46 A.3d 28, 39 (R.I. 2012). - 18 - prescriptive easement without satisfying all of the requisite elements, our agreement with the trial justice’s finding that Butterfly failed to meet its burden of proof on the element of hostility suffices for us to uphold his decision. We therefore need not address Butterfly’s argument that the trial justice erroneously concluded that the annual Christmas tree sales interrupted the delivery trucks’ continuous use of JR & Sons’s lot. IV Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be remanded to that tribunal. Goldberg, J., with whom Suttell, C.J., joins, dissenting. Because I believe that there was sufficient evidence to show the plaintiffs’ hostile use of the disputed area, and that no evidence was presented to support the trial justice’s finding of implied permission to defeat such hostile use in this case, I respectfully dissent. The discord in this case finds its genesis in the fact that on August 8, 1985, Albert Romanella conveyed a large commercial building that encroaches upon—and which has a loading dock that cannot be accessed without traversing upon—JR & Sons’s property. To gain access to this loading dock, JR & Sons granted plaintiffs an express easement, recorded in the Town of Westerly’s land evidence records, which “permit[s] ingress and egress to and from the loading dock at the southwest corner of [Butterfly Realty’s] building[.]” This easement, however, expressly prohibits deliveries over the delineated route by “semi-trailers.” The testimony and evidence presented at trial established that, beginning in 1985 until the time of trial, Butterfly Realty’s building was leased to a succession of businesses, all of which - 19 - used the loading dock for deliveries to their respective businesses. Each tenant received deliveries at the loading dock at varying frequencies from delivery trucks, including tractor- trailer trucks. In order to access the loading dock, these delivery trucks—including semi- trailers—would drive over JR & Sons’s lot, outside the boundaries of the express easement. Thus, the evidence presented at trial clearly establishes that plaintiffs’ use of lot No. 330 to reach the loading dock was adverse to the restrictions set forth in the recorded easement—and any understanding between the parties—ab initio. Nevertheless, the trial justice concluded that the use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock was actual, open, and notorious, but not sufficiently hostile to establish an easement by prescription. The trial justice explained that “Romanella’s assent, accompanied with various restrictions, controlled the use of the area. * * * Being neighborly while actively controlling the use of one’s property should not be construed as establishment of the hostility necessary to suffer the loss of a property right.” He concluded that “Butterfly’s use of the trucking routes, although exceeding the scope of the express easement, was not ‘hostile’ because Romanella implicitly permitted the use to continue.” I am of the opinion that, in so finding, the trial justice clearly erred in that he overlooked and misconceived evidence on the controlling issues and law in this case. There simply is no evidence to support the finding that defendant employed “various restrictions” or “controlled the use of the area.” In Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584 (R.I. 2012) (hereinafter, Butterfly I), this Court explained that, “to show sufficient hostility, a claimant must, by clear and convincing evidence, demonstrate objective trespassory acts that are adverse to the rights of the true owner, not acts that are inconsistent to the use of the true owner.” Id. at 590 (citing Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 832 (R.I. 2001)). However, - 20 - “[i]t is sufficient if one goes upon the land openly and uses it adversely to the true owner, the owner being chargeable with knowledge of what is done openly on his land.” Id. at 589 (quoting Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 831). “Thus, to constitute hostile use, the claimant need only show a use ‘inconsistent with the right of the owner, without permission asked or given, * * * such as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].’” Drescher v. Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218, 1228 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003)). This Court has previously been confronted with whether a landowner’s use was permissive, thus defeating the element of hostility and a plaintiff’s claim for possession. In Altieri v. Dolan, 423 A.2d 482, 484 (R.I. 1980)—on which the trial justice relied—this Court held that a prescriptive easement was not established where a shared driveway between neighbors “was used on a friendly and neighborly basis and not adversely.” In reaching this conclusion, however, this Court specified that the plaintiffs failed to make the requisite showing of “some affirmative act constituting notice to [defendant] that their occupancy was hostile to the owner and they were claiming the property as their own.” Id. (quoting Picerne v. Sylvestre, 122 R.I. 85, 92, 404 A.2d 476, 480 (1979)). Again, in Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1019 (R.I. 1999), this Court determined that “an inference of permissive use, which would defeat the element of hostile use” could not be drawn solely from a landowner’s knowledge that a water line was being installed under a right of way that the landowner had leased to the defendant. In Burke-Tarr, not only did the landowner fail to object to the installation of the water line or to its continued use, but the landowner also testified that she did not know that the installed water line significantly exceeded the area specified in the leased right of way. Id. at 1020. As a result, this Court held that, in the - 21 - absence of an objection, a landowner’s mere awareness of how his or her land is used is insufficient to establish express or implied permission which could negate hostile use. Id. at 1019-20. Finally, in Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832, this Court further explained that “[w]hen confronted with * * * an open, unsolicited, and long-continued use of the property, the true owner must affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.” (emphasis in original.) This Court specified that “[m]ere acquiescence or silence, however, in the face of uses that are inconsistent with the true owner’s property rights, does not constitute permission.” Id. In Reitsma, this Court concluded that “no inference of permission from [the defendant] could be drawn from the mere fact that [the defendant] allowed the use to continue.” Id. In this case, the trial justice noted that he was “not convinced that the owners or the employees of the parties knew the exact location of the easement at the time that Butterfly was using the disputed area.” Indeed, neither Charles Sposato nor James Romanella, the current owners of JR & Sons, was aware that there even was an easement. Nonetheless, the evidence presented at trial established that tractor-trailer trucks regularly made deliveries to the loading dock via the brown route and the green route, in violation of the terms of the express easement for over twenty years, which is well in excess of the statutory period necessary to establish a prescriptive easement. The evidence also established that the current owners of JR & Sons had no idea that there was an express easement, along with its prohibition against semi-trailer trucks that was filed in the land evidence records. The record also shows that no express permission was given to plaintiffs to traverse lot No. 330 using the green and brown routes, nor was there ever an objection raised by defendant to this use. - 22 - Charles Sposato and James Romanella testified that each owned twenty-five percent of JR & Sons when Albert Romanella conveyed the property—and JR & Sons granted the easement—to Butterfly Realty in 1985. Their testimony indicates that they were uninformed and ignorant of the details of this transaction. Sposato testified that since that time, it was always his belief that Butterfly Realty should pay JR & Sons for its use of lot No. 330, and claims to have expressed this belief to Albert Romanella. Sposato did not disclose how Albert Romanella responded to this request. Sposato testified that after Albert Romanella died in 2004, he considered asking for rental payments, but never approached anyone from Butterfly Realty. Nonetheless, he testified at trial that, consistently for the past twenty-five years, he unequivocally believed that Butterfly Realty should be paying rent to JR & Sons for its use of lot No. 330: “Q: But your testimony is that for twenty-five years you thought they should have been paying rent; correct? “A: No question about it. “Q: And your attitude about it never changed in that twenty-five years? You always thought they should be paying money? “A: No question about it. “Q: It took you until 2010 to ask for it? “A: Because I had leverage then. “Q: You had leverage six years ago when Al Romanella died; didn’t you? “A: We discussed it. We didn’t do it.” This testimony is not that of a friendly neighbor. In his deposition, Sposato claimed that an oral agreement existed between Albert Romanella and Mat Serra—who owned the liquor store on Butterfly Realty’s property prior to 1985—that allowed trucks to drive onto lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. However, when asked when this purported oral agreement was reached between Romanella and Serra, Sposato testified: - 23 - “I never had a date. I never knew of a date that it was reached. It was just something that [James] and I had gotten from Albert that he had given to them people. * * * We never had any [sic] we didn’t know where the lines were. We knew that they were on our property. * * * [B]ut I, I never knew Albert talked to them. He never told anybody. So, if he talked to them, I don’t know when that was.” (Emphasis added.) This comment led to the following exchange: “Q: So, from 1985 through the time that you called [the surveyor]— “A: Yes. “Q: —to locate the property line— “A: Yup, I didn’t know. “Q: —you were operating under an understanding that there was some kind of oral agreement? “A: That’s how we addressed it. We never bothered anybody.” (Emphasis added.) At trial, however, when asked whether he knew of any agreement in place that permitted delivery trucks to traverse lot No. 330 to access the loading dock, Sposato flatly replied, “Not at all.” Although the majority claims that this nebulous testimony establishes that Sposato “apparently believed” that Albert Romanella had already granted plaintiffs permission to traverse lot No. 330, our case law is clear that a landowner’s subjective belief is insufficient to establish permissive use. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832. And, in this case, Sposato was wrong. Our law therefore requires, when confronted with Butterfly Realty’s “open, unsolicited, and long- continued use of the property,” that JR & Sons “affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.” Id. The evidence, however, clearly establishes that defendant did neither. According to Shawn Martin, neither Albert Romanella nor Sposato ever voiced an objection to the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. Indeed, there was no communication between these neighbors on this issue for twenty-five years. Martin’s wife, Rita Martin—who - 24 - managed the liquor store from the time it opened in 1985 until its closing in 1989—testified that although she personally observed tractor-trailer trucks making deliveries to the loading dock, she had never received any written or oral communications from anyone affiliated with JR & Sons about the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. Paul Williams, who worked in the auto parts store for fifteen years—from 1991 until 2006—explained that the auto parts store received weekly deliveries at the loading dock from semi-trailer trucks that were approximately fifty feet in length. Williams also testified that he never had a conversation with anyone affiliated with JR & Sons concerning the trucks’ deliveries to the loading dock. Finally, Craig Jackson, the owner of Auto Audio, testified that he also observed semi-trailer trucks at the loading dock on a weekly basis to make deliveries to the auto parts store. He maintained, however, that the only time he could recall deliveries being interrupted was when defendant installed the concrete pylons in 2010. In addition, Sposato testified that, for more than twenty-five years, he personally observed tractor-trailer trucks traverse lot No. 330 to reach the loading dock on a weekly basis. He also testified that he never voiced an objection to plaintiffs’ use of lot No. 330, nor did he make any attempt to stop delivery trucks from using the lot to reach the loading dock. Curiously, in the event his building was damaged by a delivery truck, Sposato claimed he would speak directly with the driver, and not with Butterfly Realty or its tenants. Thus, the record in this case clearly shows that defendant never raised an objection to plaintiffs’ use of the disputed area as is required by our law. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832. Moreover, the evidence in this case also does not support the majority’s conclusion that JR & Sons impliedly gave plaintiffs permission to use the disputed area, or that defendant’s actions rose above the “inactive status of quiescence or unqualified submission” that is - 25 - insufficient to support an inference of permission. Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832-33 (“Mere failure to protest is not permission but acquiescence. * * * Acquiescence is the inactive status of quiescence or unqualified submission to the hostile claim of another, and is not to be confused with permission, which denotes a grant of permission in fact or a license.”) (quoting Garrett v. Gray, 266 A.2d 21, 27-28 (Md. 1970) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)). In support of its holding that Charles Sposato and James Romanella “took affirmative steps consistent with an inference of permission,” the majority first points to the fact that Sposato would move his car for delivery trucks traversing lot No. 330. However, the record reflects that this action was not necessarily taken for the purpose of allowing access to plaintiffs’ loading dock. Rather, Sposato indicated that, although he would move his car so that traffic on lot No. 330 would not become congested, he could not identify whether the truck accessing the lot at the time was making a delivery to the Butterfly Realty building or to one of his own tenants. In fact, Sposato stated that vehicles—including tractor trailers—made deliveries to his own ten tenants on lot No. 330 by following the brown route. Likewise, when asked on cross-examination about the damage to his property—which he claimed was caused by deliveries made by tractor-trailer trucks to the Butterfly Realty building—Sposato admitted that vehicles making deliveries to his own tenants could have been responsible for the damage: “Q: I believe your testimony was to the effect that trailer trucks making deliveries to the [Butterfly Building] caused the concrete apron to break up; is that correct? “A: We believe the trucks going through there caused the concrete ramp to break as you can see. We believe the trucks did that.” “Q: Well, which trucks? “A: All I said was trucks did that. I don’t know which truck did it. “Q: Well, was it trucks servicing [Butterfly Realty] or was it trucks servicing your tenants that caused that? “A: I couldn’t tell you. I really don’t know which truck. I said trucks did that not the cars. “Q: But—so it could have been your own tenants’ deliveries that - 26 - caused that problem? “A: Yes. “Q: And you also testified, did you not, that trucks had hit your building? “A: Yes. “* * * “Q: Was that—could that also have been any truck that did so? “A: Could that also have been any truck? Of course.” The majority also points to conversations that James Romanella purportedly had to support its holding that defendant “took affirmative steps consistent with an inference of permission.” I believe, however, that the majority’s reliance on these conversations is misplaced, and similarly overlooks and misconstrues the material evidence presented in this case. For instance, the majority recounts that James testified in his deposition that, after instances in which his building was damaged by a delivery truck, he had two separate conversations with Paul Martin—first in 2001 and again in 2004—in which he claims that Martin apologized and promised “that he would make sure it didn’t happen again.” However, Paul Martin’s testimony at trial reveals that, from 1985 to 2003, he had no involvement in Butterfly Realty. In fact, Martin’s testimony reveals that he only acquired an interest in—and became involved in— Butterfly Realty in 2010. Furthermore, events that occurred in 2001—sixteen years after Butterfly Realty acquired the property—and in 2004—nineteen years later—are well beyond the statutory time period necessary to establish prescriptive use, and therefore have no bearing on whether the use was permissive. See G.L. 1956 § 34-7-1. Nonetheless, the majority points to yet another purported conversation that James Romanella recounted at trial, in which he claims to have received a call from one of Butterfly Realty’s tenants regarding whether delivery trucks could navigate lot No. 330 with the Christmas tree sales in place. This conversation occurred sometime during a twenty-year period: “Q: Now, at any time did you ever have any conversations with anyone affiliated from Auto Zone regarding the Christmas tree - 27 - operation that you just described? “A: Yes. “Q: When did this occur? “A: I’m not sure what year but obviously it was prior to 2005. * * * [I]t would [have been] between 1985 and 2005. “Q: Okay. Do you know if it was in the 1990s, in the 2000s? “A: I’m not sure.” Despite his inability to recall at what point in the twenty-year span this brief conversation occurred, Romanella detailed how he told the manager from Auto Zone “that it was my parking lot and that stand had been there year after year and it would continue as long as my tenant wanted to do it.” In addition to relying on this nebulous testimony, the majority fails to recognize that this testimony at trial stands in stark contrast to James Romanella’s deposition testimony—which was introduced into evidence at trial—in which he declared that, aside from the two aforementioned conversations with Paul Martin, he never had any other conversations with Martin or any affiliates, tenants, or co-owners of Butterfly Realty—including Auto Zone and Auto Audio—until the concrete pylons were installed. Thus, the record does not support the trial justice’s conclusion—and the majority’s affirmation—that defendant’s “assent, accompanied with various restrictions, controlled the use of the area.” Finally, the majority concludes that Sposato’s neighborly ways are what led him to never address anyone affiliated with Butterfly Realty or its tenants to voice an objection or stop the encroachment. Although the majority claims that Sposato “consciously refrained” from asking plaintiffs for compensation, the evidence presented at trial once again tells a different story. Sposato testified that it was always his belief that plaintiffs should pay for its use of JR & Sons’s property, but that he never asked for rent from Butterfly Realty until approximately six months before trial, when he telephoned Paul Martin and demanded that Butterfly Realty pay $900 per month for its tenants’ use of lot No. 330: - 28 - “Q: And your testimony here today is that you were voicing objections about Butterfly Realty and their tenants using your property to make deliveries and parking their cars twenty-five years ago? “A: Did I? Are you asking me did I say that? “Q: Yes. “A: Yes, I did. “Q: Okay. But the first time you ever addressed this issue with Butterfly was approximately six months ago; correct? “A: That’s what was prompted by what I told you because we thought they were using our property to park on, using our property to turn around on, coming up to the—and I said to my partner [James], and we both discussed it, if they are going to use that property they should pay us a rental and that brought my call to Paul Martin which I did.” In his deposition testimony, Sposato testified that, prior to this demand for rent money, he was unaware that there was an express easement from JR & Sons to Butterfly Realty, and was surprised to learn of the existence of the easement and of its terms. However, as soon as he learned about it, he made a hefty demand for $900 per month. When Butterfly Realty refused, JR & Sons installed concrete pylons along the express easement, making it impossible for any delivery vehicle to access the loading dock. When asked at trial why he installed the pylons, Sposato’s response was about money: “I was trying to get together with Paul Martin and come to some kind of agreement for them using all of our property all the time, that’s why I installed them so I’d obstruct the flow.” This testimony mirrored Sposato’s deposition testimony, in which he declared why he had the surveyor place an outline along the easement boundary: “Because we wanted compensation for using our property.” These uncontroverted facts chronicle that Sposato—as an owner of JR & Sons—was not trying to be neighborly; rather, he always wanted to be compensated for the use of lot No. 330. Nonetheless, he was ignorant of the dimensions of his own land and did nothing. The plaintiffs - 29 - used the area in a manner adverse to his ownership rights for over twenty-five years. 1 Our case law is clear that JR & Sons’s failure to effectively communicate permission or objection to stop the prescriptive clock from ticking is fatal to a finding of permissive use. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832 (“When confronted with * * * an open, unsolicited, and long-continued use of the property, the true owner must affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.”); see also Restatement (Third) Servitudes § 2.17 cmt. c. at 265-66 (2000) (as acknowledged in the majority’s opinion, “[l]andowners are required either to formalize permissive arrangements, or to prevent use by others to avoid the risk that rights will be established by prescription”). 2 The evidence in this case clearly shows that defendant did neither. Thus, absent permission or objection to plaintiffs’ use, our case law is equally clear that defendant’s mere awareness that tractor-trailer trucks traversed lot No. 330 to access the loading dock is insufficient to establish implied permission to negate plaintiffs’ hostile 1 Curiously, although Sposato testified that he personally constructed the building that houses his office on lot No. 330, he claims to have never noticed the express easement on any engineering drawing used in this construction. 2 The majority cites § 2.17 of the Restatement (Third) Servitudes (2000) for the assertion that a recognized danger of prescriptive easements is their tendency to discourage “neighborly conduct and accommodation.” However, I believe that this language must be read in full context: “Prescription has both positive and negative effects. It encourages owners to prevent unauthorized users from developing reliance interests in continued use of their land, and it protects the reliance interests of those whose uses have continued without interruption for the prescriptive period. On the negative side, it discourages neighborly conduct and accommodation. Landowners are required either to formalize permissive arrangements, or to prevent use by others to avoid the risk that rights will be established by prescription. Prescription tends to increase the costs of land ownership by creating a need for periodic monitoring to detect adverse uses. On the positive side, prescription increases the security of arrangements based on long-continued uses and tends to increase the value of land served by the use.” Id. at 265- 66 (emphases added). - 30 - use. See Burke-Tarr, 724 A.2d at 1020 (landowner’s testimony that she was unaware that the installed water line significantly exceeded the area specified in the leased right of way, coupled with her failure to object to the installation of a water line or to its continued use, was insufficient to show permissive use). The record in this case is clear that JR & Sons did nothing to stop plaintiffs’ adverse use until it was too late. Moreover, I do not believe that this case presents the Court with an expansion of an express easement as the majority contends. It is undisputed that an express easement existed, permitting plaintiffs to access the loading dock from lot No. 330. However, it is also undisputed that the actual routes used by the delivery trucks—the green route and the brown route—did not follow, and occurred well outside of, the boundaries of the express easement, and operated in direct contravention of its specific prohibition against semi-trailers. I would therefore contrast this case from this Court’s holding in Hilley v. Lawrence, 972 A.2d 643 (R.I. 2009), in which this Court stated that “[w]hen permission is granted for a particular use, a later use of the same kind cannot be characterized as adverse.” Id. at 652 (citing Stone v. Green Hill Civic Association, Inc., 786 A.2d 387, 390 (R.I. 2001) (emphasis added)). As a threshold matter, the use of lot No. 330 by tractor-trailer trucks was without permission, in violation of the recorded easement, and was adverse to the landowner. See Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228 (“[T]o constitute hostile use, the claimant need only show a use ‘inconsistent with the right of the owner, without permission asked or given, * * * such as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].’”) (quoting Tavares, 814 A.2d at 351). Moreover, despite the recorded easement’s express prohibition against semi-trailers, evidence presented at trial clearly established that these types of trucks frequented the loading dock for decades without objection by defendant. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832 (“Mere acquiescence or silence * * * in the face of - 31 - uses that are inconsistent with the true owner’s property rights, does not constitute permission.”). Moreover, I discern no evidentiary support for the trial justice’s conclusion—and the majority’s affirmation—that although the green and brown routes were used in full view of defendant, it “was done so with [its] permission.” See id. (“When confronted with * * * an open, unsolicited, and long-continued use of the property, the true owner must affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.”). As such, I believe the plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that their use of lot No. 330 was hostile. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the trial justice erred in finding that there was implied permission for semi-trailer trucks to access the loading dock by traversing over lot No. 330 outside of the perimeters of the express easement. I am further unpersuaded that defendant’s mere knowledge that trucks were traversing the lot created an implied permission sufficient to defeat plaintiffs’ hostile use. See Burke-Tarr, 724 A.2d at 1019 (a landowner’s knowledge of how his or her land is used, without a grant of permission or objection, is insufficient to establish express or implied permission). Finally, although I acknowledge the majority’s declared intention to charter “a consistent path by showing solicitude for the rights of record owners,” I believe it should do so on the basis of the evidence in the record. Simply put, this case centers on a record wholly barren of evidence to support the majority’s conclusion. Continuous Use Because I would hold that Butterfly Realty’s use of the claimed area was hostile, it is also necessary to address the parties’ arguments concerning continuous use before determining whether plaintiffs were in fact entitled to a prescriptive easement. See Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 588 (“One who claims an easement by prescription bears the burden of establishing ‘actual, - 32 - open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use under a claim of right for at least ten years.’”) (quoting Hilley, 972 A.2d at 651-52). In his decision, the trial justice determined that Butterfly Realty had “failed to establish continued use for a period of ten years,” finding that the yearly Christmas tree sales had interrupted the continuous use of the disputed area. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred in finding that the Christmas tree sales interrupted plaintiffs’ continuous use of the area. I agree. According to Rita Martin, for one month each year, during the Christmas season, tenants of JR & Sons would sell Christmas trees alongside the northern side of the laundromat. She described the area occupied by the trees as extending a “little beyond” the painted parking spaces located on the northern side of the laundromat. At trial, Mrs. Martin sketched the approximate area of the tree sales on a scaled map; according to her drawing, the trees did not overlap any part of the brown route. She explained, however, that the actual dimensions of the area occupied by the trees would vary slightly from one year to another. Nonetheless, she recounted that the tree sales never hindered deliveries to the loading dock. Paul Williams also testified about his observations of the annual Christmas tree sales. He stated that the tree sales took place every Christmas season that he worked at the auto parts store, and ran from the end of November through December. Like Mrs. Martin, Williams sketched the location of the tree sales on a scaled map; this drawing depicted the trees encroaching upon the brown route, but not blocking the route entirely. Williams stated that he had personally observed trucks making deliveries while the trees were in place, but the trucks would have to “move[] over a little” to avoid the trees. According to Williams, the space in between the trees and the Butterfly Realty building was “a little tight,” but that a semi-trailer truck could access the loading dock. In fact, Williams insisted that the trees did not prevent the delivery trucks from entering - 33 - from East Avenue and reaching the loading dock. As did Mrs. Martin and Williams, Craig Jackson, the owner of Auto Audio, also drew the area occupied by the Christmas trees on a scaled diagram. Jackson’s sketch indicated that the trees did not encroach upon any portion of the brown route, and, depicted the “average” size of the Christmas tree display, because it varied from year to year. Jackson testified that, despite the Christmas tree display, the weekly deliveries to his store were never interrupted until defendant installed the pylons along the southwestern boundary of the easement. Sposato testified that the Christmas tree sales took place on the northern side of the laundromat almost every year from 1985 to 2006, and lasted for approximately one month from Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve. When presented with Williams’s drawing, Sposato indicated that the drawing was a “good illustration” of the area occupied by the Christmas trees. When asked about the trucks’ ability to use the brown route while the trees were in place, Sposato stated, “[t]here’s no room for anybody to really get through there in my opinion.” He clarified, however, that he was “not saying that [the delivery trucks] didn’t at times go through there because obviously they did, but not conveniently.” Significantly, there was no testimony from James Romanella that the annual Christmas tree sales blocked access to the loading dock or that trucks were unable to pass over the brown route. Our case law has recognized that one of the methods by which a record owner can interrupt a claimant’s continuous use of a disputed area is by “physical ouster of the claimant or a ‘substantial interruption’ of the claimant’s possession by the record owner.” Carnevale v. Dupee, 783 A.2d 404, 409-10 (R.I. 2001) (quoting LaFreniere v. Sprague, 108 R.I. 43, 52, 271 A.2d 819, 824 (1970) (emphasis added)). This Court previously has found that a landowner’s casual or passive attempts to interrupt a claimant’s continuous use were not sufficiently - 34 - substantial so as to amount to an interruption of continuous use. See, e.g., Carnevale, 783 A.2d at 411 (the mere act of making a claimant aware of surveyed boundaries is insufficient to substantially interrupt the claimant’s physical possession of the property); Jerry Brown Farm Association, Inc. v. Kenyon, 119 R.I. 43, 48, 375 A.2d 964, 966-67 (1977) (the placement of “a saw horse with a sign reading ‘Road Closed’ at the entrance to the road once a year,” when “the saw horse only covered a small portion of the road” and “[v]ehicles desiring access would simply go around the sign,” did not constitute substantial interruption); LaFreniere, 108 R.I. at 52, 271 A.2d at 824 (holding that performing a survey and giving notice to claimants of the proper boundary line did not constitute a sufficiently substantial interruption to halt the continuous use of the area, when claimants removed surveyor’s stakes and continued to use the area in a similar manner); see also 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses § 62 at 559 (2004) (“Ineffective interruptions, such as the erection of barricades and gates that are ignored or destroyed, will not prevent a use from ripening into [a prescriptive] easement.”). Accordingly, a landowner’s actions to break a claimant’s continuous use of a disputed area “must be such as to actually interfere with and interrupt substantially the claimant’s use of the land.” 3 LaFreniere, 108 R.I. at 53, 271 A.2d at 824. In Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 591, this Court determined that the factual findings of the trial justice were inconsistent with his conclusion that the annual Christmas tree sales interrupted Butterfly Realty’s continuous use of the prescriptive area, and remanded the case with instructions to further examine the evidence and decide this issue. In the trial justice’s second 3 It is important to note that continuous and uninterrupted use by a claimant does not require constant use of the disputed area; “[i]t is necessary that it be continuous only in the sense that the claimant exercised a claim of right without interference at such times as it was reasonable to make a proper use of the land.” LaFreniere v. Sprague, 108 R.I. 43, 53, 271 A.2d 819, 824 (1970). - 35 - decision, he once again determined that the plaintiffs’ “use of the green and brown routes was not continuous for the statutory period of ten years,” based on similar findings that, because of the Christmas tree sales, tractor trailers “sometimes had more difficulty” accessing the loading dock area, although “[s]maller trucks and consumer vehicles were still usually able to make it through this narrowed passage.” However, there was no testimony or evidence presented at trial that the annual Christmas tree sales blocked access to the loading dock by delivery trucks sufficient to constitute an ouster. At best, the evidence suggested that the placement of the tree display merely made it inconvenient for trucks to access the loading dock. Inconvenience that does not rise to the level of physical ouster or substantial interruption as required by our case law is of no moment on the question of continuous use. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the trial justice erred when he found that the presence of the annual Christmas tree sales interrupted Butterfly Realty’s continuous use of the green route and the brown route. Lastly, the plaintiffs argue that its tenants’ use of the claimed prescriptive area may be imputed to Butterfly Realty. However, after concluding that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claim for a prescriptive easement, the trial justice did not address on remand whether the various tenants’ use of lot No. 330 could be imputed to Butterfly Realty. Because the trial justice did not reach the issue of imputed use, it is therefore unnecessary to address it. Conclusion Based on the foregoing, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have established, by clear and satisfactory evidence, that their use of lot No. 330 was “actual, open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use under a claim of right for at least ten years.” Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 588 (quoting Hilley, 972 A.2d at 651-52). - 36 - RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: Butterfly Realty et al. v.

We briefly recount below those facts relevant to the instant appeal.', 'The property at the center of this dispute consists of three commercial lots located in the Town of Westerly where East Avenue meets Granite Street and which are identified on assessor’s plat No. 77 as lots Nos. 330, 331, and 332. JR & Sons owns the most southerly of the three parcels, lot No. 330, which has frontage on East Avenue. At all times relevant to this appeal, a commercial building containing a laundromat has occupied the northern portion of lot No. 330. Lot No. 331, which is owned by Dairyland, Inc., lies immediately to the north of lot No. 330 and has frontage on Granite Street. Lot No. 332 sits immediately to the north of lot No. 331 and also has frontage on Granite Street. On August 8, 1985, Albert Romanella, then- president of JR & Sons, conveyed lot No. 332 by warranty deed to Butterfly Realty (Butterfly). That same day, Albert Romanella also assigned his lease for lot No. 331 to Butterfly.', 'Butterfly owns a single commercial building that occupies most of lots Nos. 331 and 332. 1 The southwestern corner of the building houses a loading dock, the door to which faces southward towards JR & Sons’s lot. Because the building sits nearly on top of the boundary line between lots Nos. 331 and 330, delivery trucks cannot access the loading dock without entering onto JR & Sons’s property. Accordingly, on August 16, 1985, JR & Sons granted Butterfly an express easement, recorded in the Town of Westerly’s land evidence records, which “permit[s] ingress and egress to and from the loading dock at the southwest corner of [Butterfly’s] building[.]”', 'The terms of the easement, however, expressly prohibit deliveries by “semi- 1', 'Part of the southwest corner of the building actually encroaches upon JR & Sons’s lot No. 330.', '-2- trailers.” The southern boundary of the easement runs roughly parallel to the side of Butterfly’s building and becomes wider as it moves from east to west.', 'From 1985 onward, Butterfly’s building housed a succession of businesses, all of which made some use of the loading dock. A liquor store operated out of the building from 1985 to 1989. After the liquor store vacated the premises, Butterfly leased a portion of the building to an auto parts store. From 1993 through 2010, another tenant of Butterfly’s, Auto Audio, also operated a business out of a different portion of the building. The various businesses received deliveries from trucks of different sizes and with differing frequencies. In general, however, the delivery trucks would drive over JR & Sons’s lot, beyond the bounds of the express easement, to access the loading dock.', 'In May 2010, JR & Sons hired an engineer to determine the precise location of the express easement’s southern boundary after a delivery truck damaged a building on JR & Sons’s lot. JR & Sons then ordered the installation of “concrete pylons” along the southwestern boundary of the express easement. With the pylons in place, it was nearly impossible for delivery vehicles to directly access the loading dock. On June 14, 2010, Butterfly 2 responded by filing a complaint in Washington County Superior Court, claiming a prescriptive easement over JR & Sons’s lot. 3 The defendant filed a counterclaim for a permanent injunction to compel Butterfly to comply with the terms of the express easement.', 'A two-day bench trial on the parties’ claims commenced on December 8, 2010. The testimony and exhibits presented at trial indicated that delivery trucks typically used one of two routes to access the loading dock. These two paths were referred to as the “brown route” and the 2', 'A later amended complaint included Dairyland, Inc. as a plaintiff. 3', 'Butterfly and Dairyland also filed claims for an implied easement, an easement by necessity, an easement by implication, an easement by acquiescence, and adverse possession. The only claim before the Court in the instant appeal is plaintiffs’ claim for a prescriptive easement.', '-3- “green route” at trial. See Appendix. 4 When following the brown route, a truck would enter lot No. 330 from a curb cut on East Avenue and then drive westward, in between the laundromat and the Butterfly building, before making a left turn behind the laundromat. The delivery truck would then back up to the loading dock. When using the green route, a delivery truck would enter lot No. 331 from a curb cut on Granite Street, then drive southwestward across several painted parking spaces, 5 and cross onto lot No. 330, where it would continue along the brown route to reach the loading dock. At trial, both parties presented several witnesses who testified about the delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s lot. We summarize below the relevant testimony. 6', 'Shawn Martin, a part-owner of Butterfly, testified on behalf of plaintiffs. He explained that his partner, an attorney, had negotiated the exact terms of the express easement in 1985 but stated that he “roughly” understood where the boundaries of the express easement were located. According to Mr. Martin, neither Albert Romanella nor Albert Romanella’s partner, Charles Sposato, had ever voiced any objections about the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock.', 'The plaintiff also presented Mr. Martin’s wife, Rita Martin, who managed the liquor store from the time it opened in 1985 until the time it closed in 1989. During the many hours that she spent at the store, Mrs. Martin personally observed trucks make deliveries to the loading dock. She estimated that the liquor store received approximately twelve to fifteen deliveries per week. Mrs. Martin further estimated that the trucks’ use of the brown and green routes was either roughly equal or that the brown route received slightly more use than the green route. She indicated that she had never received any written or oral communications from anyone affiliated 4', 'An engineering drawing, appended to this opinion, depicts the “brown” and “green” routes testified to at trial. The express easement appears on the drawing as a dotted line. 5', 'Some of the parking spaces actually straddle the boundary line between lots Nos. 330 and 331. 6', 'Three pretrial depositions were additionally admitted into evidence as full exhibits.', '-4- with JR & Sons about the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. Mrs. Martin testified that she and her husband had a “friendly relationship” with Mr. Sposato.', 'Mrs. Martin explained that, for approximately one month each year, one or more tenants of JR & Sons would sell Christmas trees alongside the northern exterior wall of the laundromat. She testified that the actual dimensions of the area occupied by the trees would vary slightly from one year to another. Nonetheless, according to her recollection, the trees never impeded the trucks’ abilities to make deliveries.', 'Paul Williams also testified on plaintiffs’ behalf. Mr. Williams worked in the auto parts store from 1991, approximately two years after the store opened, until 2006. 7 He explained that the auto parts store usually received deliveries at the loading dock on a weekly basis. According to Mr. Williams, those deliveries arrived by semi-trailer trucks which were approximately fifty feet in length. He also testified that sometimes a garbage truck would pick up trash from the loading dock or a United Postal Service (UPS) truck would deliver a large item to the loading dock. Mr. Williams estimated that the delivery trucks’ use of the brown and green routes was roughly equal, but he clarified that a truck driver’s ability to use the green route depended on whether cars were parked in the parking spaces located southeast of Butterfly’s building. See Appendix. Mr. Williams testified that the annual Christmas tree sales did not prevent the delivery trucks from entering through the curb cut on East Avenue and reaching the loading dock. 7', 'The record is somewhat vague concerning delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 during the time period from 1989 to 1991. As we explained in our previous opinion, this ambiguity is not necessarily fatal to plaintiffs’ claim because the time from 1991 forward could satisfy the statutory ten-year period for a prescriptive easement. See Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584, 587 n.2 (R.I. 2012)', '-5-', 'The plaintiffs’ final witness was Craig Jackson, the owner of Auto Audio. Mr. Jackson testified that he personally supervised about half of Auto Audio’s deliveries. According to Mr. Jackson, UPS trucks made deliveries to the loading dock about twice per day and used both the brown and green routes. Approximately once every two weeks, a garbage truck would use the loading dock to pick up both Auto Audio’s and the auto parts store’s trash. Consistent with Mr. Williams’s testimony, Mr. Jackson testified that he observed semi-trailer trucks accessing the loading dock on a weekly basis to make deliveries to the auto parts store. He confirmed that the average size of the area occupied by the Christmas trees varied from year to year but maintained that the only time he could recall deliveries being impeded is when the concrete pylons were installed in 2010.', 'Charles Sposato, a 50 percent owner of JR & Sons, testified for defendant.', 'In a deposition submitted into evidence at trial, Mr. Sposato stated that he was unaware of the exact location of the express easement until May 2010 when the survey was completed. Mr. Sposato further indicated in his deposition that he had previously believed that Albert Romanella had an oral, rather than a written, agreement with Butterfly that delivery trucks were allowed to cross over JR & Sons’s property to reach the loading dock. Accordingly, he testified at trial that he was surprised in May 2010 when he saw for the first time the deed granting Butterfly an express easement. He insisted that, since 1985, he had consistently believed that Butterfly should pay for its use of JR & Sons’s lot. Approximately twenty-five years ago, he expressed this belief to Albert Romanella.', 'After Albert Romanella passed away in 2004, Mr. Sposato considered requesting that Butterfly pay rent but ultimately did not approach anyone from Butterfly at that time. He did not demand rent from anyone at Butterfly until approximately six months before trial when he telephoned Paul Martin, Shawn Martin’s brother. According to Mr. Sposato’s', '-6- recounting of the telephone conversation, he requested that Butterfly pay $900 per month for its tenants’ use of lot No. 330.', 'According to Mr. Sposato, delivery trucks had more than once caused damage to JR & Sons’s property. On those occasions, Mr. Sposato spoke directly with the drivers of the trucks, but he did not tell anyone from Butterfly, Dairyland, or the auto parts store that the delivery trucks could no longer use JR & Sons’s lot. When asked at trial why he never forbade the delivery trucks from entering upon JR & Sons’s property, Mr. Sposato explained, “I just wanted to be a good neighbor I guess. I just never did.”', 'Mr. Sposato also testified about his personal observations of the delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s lot. He indicated that, since 1995, he has visited JR & Sons’s property on a daily basis, except for several weeks each year that he spends in Florida. During his time at the property, Mr. Sposato personally observed semi-trailer trucks making deliveries to the loading dock. According to Mr. Sposato, the trucks mostly used the brown route. He clarified, however, that there are “many different trucks that come [into] this property. They are not all trailer trucks. They don’t all use that brown [route] at all. * * * They come in our property * * * all ways that I have noticed.” Mr. Sposato recalled a dozen or more instances when he had moved his car to accommodate the delivery trucks. He explained that the truck drivers did not ask him to move his car, but he would voluntarily do so if he noticed that the trucks were holding up traffic. Mr. Sposato confirmed that the Christmas tree sales took place on the northern side of the laundromat almost every year from 1985 to 2006 and lasted from approximately Thanksgiving through December 23 or 24.', '-7-', 'James Romanella also testified for defendant. James 8 served as vice president of JR & Sons until 2004, when he became president. He recalled a telephone conversation that he had with the manager of the auto parts store about the Christmas trees. According to James’s recounting of the conversation, the manager was concerned that the size of the area occupied by the trees was making it difficult for the delivery trucks to reach the loading dock. In response, James suggested that the delivery drivers use smaller trucks. He also informed the manager that the tree sales “would continue as long as [his] tenant wanted to do it.” James had no recollection of when this conversation occurred other than that it had taken place sometime between 1985 and 2005.', 'The trial justice denied plaintiffs’ claim for a prescriptive easement in a written decision filed on March 18, 2011. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. In an opinion issued on June 27, 2012, we concluded that the trial justice had committed an error of law because he “inappropriately required Butterfly’s tenants’ use of the disputed land to be inconsistent with JR & Sons’s use * * *.” Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 589. Accordingly, we vacated the trial justice’s decision and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Id. at 592. We additionally instructed that on remand the trial justice should address certain inconsistent findings he had made with regard to the Christmas trees’ impact on Butterfly’s continuous use of the prescriptive easement. Id. at 591. Finally, we directed the trial justice to determine whether the various tenants’ use of lot No. 330 could be imputed to Butterfly for the purposes of establishing a prescriptive easement. Id. at 591-92.', 'Upon remand and after the parties waived the presentation of additional evidence, the trial justice issued a second written decision on November 9, 2012 in which he again denied 8', 'To avoid confusion, we refer to James Romanella by his first name. In so doing, we intend no disrespect.', '-8- plaintiffs’ claim for a prescriptive easement. In his second decision, the trial justice found that the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 was actual, open, and notorious. He concluded, however, that such use was not sufficiently hostile to establish an easement by prescription. According to the trial justice, JR & Sons had given permission for the delivery trucks to traverse its lot in order to access the Butterfly building’s loading dock. He also concluded that the Christmas tree sales had interrupted the continuous use of the disputed area. The trial justice did not address whether the various tenants’ use of lot No. 330 could be imputed to Butterfly.', 'Judgment entered on November 20, 2012. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court. Additional facts will be provided, as needed, to resolve the issues raised on appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We afford “much deference to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil case.” DiPippo v.

Yuba County Water District, 160 Cal.Rptr. 423, 427 (Cal. Ct. App. 1979)). Although claims for adverse possession and prescriptive servitudes have continuing vitality in this jurisdiction, our jurisprudence on prescriptive rights in recent years has charted a consistent path by showing solicitude for the rights of record owners, and, correspondingly, guarding against the potential for uncompensated loss by holding claimants to a high burden of proof. See Drescher v. Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218, 1227 (R.I. 2012); Cahill, 11 A.3d at 88; see also Pelletier v.

He or she bears the heavy burden of proving “each element by a preponderance of clear and convincing evidence.” Carpenter v. Hanslin, 900 A.2d 1136, 1146 (R.I. 2006); see also Hilley,', '- 10 - 972 A.2d at 652 (each element for a prescriptive easement must be proven by “clear and satisfactory evidence”).', 'Any analysis of a claim for a prescriptive right must take for its point of origin the principle that such rights “are not favored in the law, * * * since they necessarily work corresponding losses or forfeitures on the rights of other persons[.]” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1227 (quoting 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses § 39 at 536 (2004)); Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 592 n.8 (stating same). “The burdens of prescription * * * fall onto the shoulders of the subservient estate.” William G. Ackerman & Shane T. Johnson, Outlaws of the Past: A Western Perspective on Prescription and Adverse Possession, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. 79, 92 (1996). Those burdens include the “infringement of a landowner’s rights, a decrease in value of the servient estate, * * * the generation of animosity between neighbors, a source of damages to land * * * and the creation of uncertainty for the landowner.” Cahill, 11 A.3d at 87-88 (quoting Ackerman, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. at 92).', 'These foundational principles are equally applicable when the holder of an express easement seeks to expand that easement by prescription. An attempt by the holder of an express easement to unilaterally “expand the physical size, purpose or use of the easement beyond the terms as contained in the original grant * * * unduly interferes with the reserved rights of the owner of the servient tenement.” 28A C.J.S. Easements § 231 at 449 (2008). In cases such as this one where the easement holder seeks to change not only the frequency or type of use, but also the dimensions of an express easement, the enlargement “‘does more than merely increase the burden upon the servient estate; it has the effect of enveloping additional land,’”—land which the owner has purposely reserved for him or herself. Northwest Pipeline Corp. v. Luna,', '- 11 - 241 P.3d 945, 948 (Idaho 2010). Here, Butterfly seeks to expand a limited express easement into an amorphous prescriptive easement that will envelop nearly the entirety of JR & Sons’s lot. 9', 'An enlargement of an express easement by prescription must satisfy all the traditional requirements for acquiring a prescriptive right. See Jon W. Bruce & James W. Ely, Jr., The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land, § 8:16 (2014). 10 In the instant case, the trial justice found that Butterfly had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that its use was hostile to the record owner or that it was continuous for the statutory period. Butterfly challenges both of these findings on appeal. Before turning our attention, however, to the merits of the trial justice’s analysis of the element of hostility, we briefly address plaintiff’s threshold contention that the trial justice was prohibited upon remand from performing any analysis of the element of hostility. 9', 'Despite the designation of the “brown” and “green” routes, the witnesses’ collective testimony at trial clearly indicated that trucks took all different paths to navigate around the maze of cars, Christmas trees, buildings, and other obstacles that from time to time littered this small parking lot. Accordingly, although Butterfly attempts to confine its claimed easement to the “brown” and “green” routes, the reality is that every time a large truck tries to navigate those pathways and finds a car or other obstacle in its way, it will stray from the designated routes and envelop even more of JR & Sons’s property. Granting such an easement would be difficult to square with “this Court’s obligation to create the least burdensome easement possible[.]” Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 839 (R.I. 2001) (Goldberg, J., dissenting). 10', 'It has been said that “[e]nlargement by prescription of an express easement is rare” due to “a lack of the elements necessary to create it.” Turner v. Bouchard, 32 A.3d 527, 534 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2011) (quoting Annot. 110 A.L.R. 915, 916 (1937)). For example, in a case factually similar to the one presently before this Court, a commercial landowner had an express easement, dating back to 1910, over part of the neighboring defendant’s property to allow trucks to access a loading dock. Mensch v. Netty, 408 N.W.2d 383, 384 (Iowa 1987). Modern-sized trucks and semi-trailers, however, could not back up to the loading dock within the narrow bounds of the express easement and therefore began to encroach farther onto the defendant’s land. See id. at 384-85. After a truck damaged the defendant’s building, the defendant refused to permit the trucks to continue to use his land to reach the loading dock. See id. at 385. Consequently, the plaintiff sought to establish that he had acquired a prescriptive easement for the additional footage. See id. The Iowa Supreme Court held that the plaintiff could not meet his burden of proof on the element of hostility because “[t]he fact that truck drivers had used the additional space to enter the alley at most shows permissive use.” Id. at 387.', '- 12 -', 'A', 'Scope of Remand', 'According to Butterfly, the trial justice exceeded the scope of this Court’s remand by revisiting the element of hostility. Butterfly argues that this Court had “already ruled that the trial justice had applied an incorrect legal standard in determining whether Butterfly had proven hostility, and did not invite the trial justice to revisit this element of proof.” 11', 'As we have explained, “lower courts * * * that receive our remand orders may not exceed the scope of the remand or open up the proceeding to legal issues beyond the remand.” Pleasant Management, LLC v.

To the contrary, our previous opinion stated that the trial justice’s “misapplication of law sufficiently tainted the balance of [his] decision, including any factual determinations.” Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 590. We therefore conclude that the trial justice was not only authorized but indeed was intended upon remand to apply the correct legal standard to the facts to make a second determination as to whether Butterfly had proven hostile use. 11', 'Butterfly additionally suggests that the trial justice based his second decision on a legal theory that was never argued. The record belies this assertion because JR & Sons argued permission from the outset of this case. In his opening statement on the first day of trial, JR & Sons’s counsel took the position that Butterfly’s use was permissive.', '- 13 -', 'B', 'Hostility', 'In his second decision, the trial justice found that Butterfly could not meet its burden of proof on the element of hostility because its delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s property was permissive. The claimant of an easement by prescription bears the burden of proving by clear and satisfactory evidence that his or her use was adverse to that of the record owner. To demonstrate hostile use, the claimant must show use “without permission asked or given * * * such as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228 (quoting Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003)). On the issue of permission, this Court long ago articulated the relevant rule as follows:', '“It is the well settled rule that use by expressed or implied', 'permission or license, no matter how long continued, cannot ripen', 'into an easement by prescription, since one of the elements', 'essential to the acquisition of the easement, namely, user as of', 'right, as distinguished from permissive use, is lacking.” Tefft v.', 'Reynolds, 43 R.I. 538, 542-43, 113 A. 787, 789 (1921). Since this pronouncement in Tefft, this Court has continuously acknowledged that express or implied permission defeats a claim for a prescriptive right. See Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1019 (R.I. 1999) (distinguishing landowner’s “express or implied permission,” which will defeat a claimed easement, from landowner’s mere awareness, which will not); cf. Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 834 (R.I. 2001) (concluding that “permission, express or implied, was never given” for claimant’s use of landowner’s property).', 'For a landowner who wishes to be an accommodating neighbor without creating a permanent burden on his or her land, “[t]he easiest remedy * * * is to give [the adverse user] permission to continue the use * * *. This effectively eliminates the adverse individual’s claim immediately.” Ackerman, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. at 95. One of the most well-recognized', '- 14 - dangers of prescriptive easements is their tendency to “discourage[] neighborly conduct and accommodation. Landowners are required either to formalize permissive arrangements, or to prevent use by others to avoid the risk that rights will be established by prescription.” Restatement (Third) Servitudes, § 2.17 cmt. c at 265-66 (2000). The more formal a reviewing court requires that permission to be, the greater the uncertainty for the landowner.', 'See Ackerman, 31 Land & Water L. Rev. at 95.', 'While this Court has required something more than silent acquiescence to show that a use was permissive, see Burke-Tarr Co., 724 A.2d at 1019, a landowner need not formally or expressly grant a user permission since “[p]ermission sufficient to preclude a claim for a prescriptive easement * * * may be inferred from surrounding circumstances.” 28A C.J.S. Easements § 45 at 245 (2008); see Burke-Tarr Co., 724 A.2d at 1019 (acknowledging that “an inference of permissive use * * * would defeat the element of hostile use”). For example, in Drescher, this Court concluded that a claimant’s use of a right-of-way was permissive, where the facts and circumstances supported an inference that the claimant’s use was pursuant to a “‘perceived invitation.’” 12 Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228-29 (emphasis added); see also Daniels v. Blake, 81 R.I. 103, 109, 99 A.2d 7, 11 (1953) (“friendly relations between respondent and complainants while the latter were openly using the strip to pass to and from the shore * * * tends to establish their use originally as merely permissive”).', 'Even where the issue of permission is raised, the burden is never on the landowner to demonstrate that the use was permissive.

Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218 (R.I. 2012), we additionally concluded that the trial justice appropriately considered the fact that neighbors and individuals other than the claimant had accessed the landowner’s property while under the “impression” that their use was permissive. See id. at 1229. We held that these facts in Drescher supported an inference of permission sufficient to defeat the claimed easement despite the fact that the permission was “illusionary” rather than actual. Id.', '- 15 - The burden at all times remains on the claimant to establish adverse use by strict proof. See id. “The determination of whether the claimant [of a prescriptive right] sustained this burden of proof involves an exercise by the trial justice of his factfinding power.” Jerry Brown Farm Association, Inc. v. Kenyon, 119 R.I. 43, 52, 375 A.2d 964, 968-69 (1977); see Hazard v. East Hills, Inc., 45 A.3d 1262, 1271 (R.I. 2012) (claims for prescriptive rights are “fact-intensive inquir[ies]”). Accordingly, the deference that this Court affords the trial justice is at its zenith. Even if more than one inference may be drawn from the record, we are bound to uphold the trial justice’s inferences so long as they are reasonable. Jerry Brown Farm Association, Inc., 119 R.I. at 51, 375 A.2d at 968. We conclude that the record in this case supports the trial justice’s reasonable inference that Butterfly’s use of JR & Sons’s lot was permissive.', 'Viewing the record from the proper deferential perspective, the testimony demonstrated that Charles Sposato—unaware of the boundaries of the express easement—begrudgingly allowed Butterfly to use his property for nearly twenty-five years, due, at least in part, to his belief that Albert Romanella had given oral permission for Butterfly’s trucks to traverse JR & Sons’s lot. Mr. Sposato consciously refrained from requesting any compensation from Butterfly for those twenty-five years. Since Mr. Sposato apparently believed that Butterfly had already received an explicit oral grant of permission from Albert Romanella to use JR & Sons’s lot, he could not reasonably be expected to have given Butterfly another express or formal grant of permission. Nor does the law require him to have done so. JR & Sons’s behavior did, however, go beyond mere tolerance and awareness. Mr. Sposato and James Romanella took affirmative steps consistent with an inference of permission. Mr. Sposato moved his car to allow the trucks', '- 16 - access to the loading dock. 13 When the manager of the auto parts store called to complain about the Christmas trees, James Romanella did not prohibit the trucks from entering while the trees were in place but instead responded by insisting that the trucks’ use of the lot must remain subservient to his tenants’ use of the lot. When his building was struck in 2001 and again in 2004, James had two separate conversations with Paul Martin, in which Mr. Martin apologized and promised James on each occasion that it would not happen again. After these conversations, James continued to allow Butterfly’s trucks to use JR & Sons’s property for nearly another six years. Mr. Sposato explained that he never forbade the delivery trucks to enter JR & Sons’s lot because he was trying to be a good neighbor.', 'This series of interactions adequately supports the trial justice’s conclusion that JR & Sons “permitted the use to continue” by giving its “assent, accompanied with various restrictions, [to] control[] the use of the area.” Such actions go beyond the “inactive status of quiescence or unqualified submission” which we have previously found insufficient to support an inference of permission. Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832-33 (quoting Garrett v. Gray, 266 A.2d 21, 27-28 (Md. 1970)). The trial justice therefore correctly concluded that Butterfly had not met its burden of clearly and convincingly proving its claim for a prescriptive easement. “A prescriptive easement cannot be established if permission to use the property can be inferred where the relationship between the parties is one of neighborly cooperation and accommodation.” 28A C.J.S. Easements § 45 at 245. The element of “hostility” does not refer to the emotional 13', 'Although Mr. Sposato’s testimony about moving his car is difficult to follow, he explained that sometimes Butterfly’s delivery trucks would enter JR & Sons’s property south of the laundromat. The trucks would then reverse direction in front of his office and back up to the loading dock, passing roughly in between the office and the rear of the laundromat. Since Mr. Sposato’s car was parked near the southwest corner of the laundromat, he would occasionally have to move it to allow the delivery trucks sufficient room to maneuver. On the appendix, JR & Sons’s office appears as a building marked “1 st[or]y masonry plaza.”', '- 17 - temperature of the neighbors’ relationship. See Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 589. Thus, the fact that Mr. Sposato and James Romanella may have accommodated Butterfly’s trucks with less than enthusiasm and alacrity does not turn a permissive use into a hostile one. 14', 'After their building was damaged one time too many, Mr. Sposato and James Romanella investigated the boundaries of the express easement in May 2010 and decided that they would no longer permit Butterfly’s uncompensated use of JR & Sons’s property beyond those boundaries. Accordingly, they asked for monthly rent and installed the pylons, which actions prompted Butterfly to file suit almost immediately. JR & Sons’s revocation of permission does not suffice to prove hostility. If it did, a landowner such as JR & Sons who has previously permitted someone to use his or her property would be placed in the untenable position of either allowing the use to continue indefinitely or revoking permission and suffering the imposition of a permanent burden on his or her property. Under our law, a landowner who has previously permitted a neighbor to use his or her land is entitled to withdraw that permission without forfeiting his or her property rights. See Hilley, 972 A.2d at 652 (where use of easement was permissive until such time as landowner withdrew permission, user who filed suit immediately after revocation of permission could not establish claim to a prescriptive easement). Accordingly, JR & Sons was free to end Butterfly’s use of its lot, and its previous cooperation does not work a forfeiture of its rights.', 'In sum, we are satisfied that, in his second decision, the trial justice gave an accurate recitation of the law on hostility and drew a reasonable inference that Butterfly’s delivery trucks’ use of JR & Sons’s lot was permissive. Since Butterfly cannot succeed on its claim for a 14', 'We note that there was testimony from both Mr. Sposato and Mrs. Martin that their relationship, at least prior to May 2010, was friendly and neighborly. On appeal, we are required to afford “substantial deference” to a trial justice’s decision to credit a witness’s testimony. Pelletier v. Laureanno, 46 A.3d 28, 39 (R.I. 2012).', '- 18 - prescriptive easement without satisfying all of the requisite elements, our agreement with the trial justice’s finding that Butterfly failed to meet its burden of proof on the element of hostility suffices for us to uphold his decision. We therefore need not address Butterfly’s argument that the trial justice erroneously concluded that the annual Christmas tree sales interrupted the delivery trucks’ continuous use of JR & Sons’s lot.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be remanded to that tribunal.', 'Goldberg, J., with whom Suttell, C.J., joins, dissenting. Because I believe that there was sufficient evidence to show the plaintiffs’ hostile use of the disputed area, and that no evidence was presented to support the trial justice’s finding of implied permission to defeat such hostile use in this case, I respectfully dissent.', 'The discord in this case finds its genesis in the fact that on August 8, 1985, Albert Romanella conveyed a large commercial building that encroaches upon—and which has a loading dock that cannot be accessed without traversing upon—JR & Sons’s property. To gain access to this loading dock, JR & Sons granted plaintiffs an express easement, recorded in the Town of Westerly’s land evidence records, which “permit[s] ingress and egress to and from the loading dock at the southwest corner of [Butterfly Realty’s] building[.]”', 'This easement, however, expressly prohibits deliveries over the delineated route by “semi-trailers.”', 'The testimony and evidence presented at trial established that, beginning in 1985 until the time of trial, Butterfly Realty’s building was leased to a succession of businesses, all of which', '- 19 - used the loading dock for deliveries to their respective businesses.', 'Each tenant received deliveries at the loading dock at varying frequencies from delivery trucks, including tractor- trailer trucks.', 'In order to access the loading dock, these delivery trucks—including semi- trailers—would drive over JR & Sons’s lot, outside the boundaries of the express easement. Thus, the evidence presented at trial clearly establishes that plaintiffs’ use of lot No. 330 to reach the loading dock was adverse to the restrictions set forth in the recorded easement—and any understanding between the parties—ab initio.', 'Nevertheless, the trial justice concluded that the use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock was actual, open, and notorious, but not sufficiently hostile to establish an easement by prescription. The trial justice explained that “Romanella’s assent, accompanied with various restrictions, controlled the use of the area. * * * Being neighborly while actively controlling the use of one’s property should not be construed as establishment of the hostility necessary to suffer the loss of a property right.” He concluded that “Butterfly’s use of the trucking routes, although exceeding the scope of the express easement, was not ‘hostile’ because Romanella implicitly permitted the use to continue.” I am of the opinion that, in so finding, the trial justice clearly erred in that he overlooked and misconceived evidence on the controlling issues and law in this case. There simply is no evidence to support the finding that defendant employed “various restrictions” or “controlled the use of the area.”', 'In Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584 (R.I. 2012) (hereinafter, Butterfly I), this Court explained that, “to show sufficient hostility, a claimant must, by clear and convincing evidence, demonstrate objective trespassory acts that are adverse to the rights of the true owner, not acts that are inconsistent to the use of the true owner.” Id. at 590 (citing Reitsma v.

Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218, 1228 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003)).', 'This Court has previously been confronted with whether a landowner’s use was permissive, thus defeating the element of hostility and a plaintiff’s claim for possession. In Altieri v. Dolan, 423 A.2d 482, 484 (R.I. 1980)—on which the trial justice relied—this Court held that a prescriptive easement was not established where a shared driveway between neighbors “was used on a friendly and neighborly basis and not adversely.” In reaching this conclusion, however, this Court specified that the plaintiffs failed to make the requisite showing of “some affirmative act constituting notice to [defendant] that their occupancy was hostile to the owner and they were claiming the property as their own.” Id.

Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1019 (R.I. 1999), this Court determined that “an inference of permissive use, which would defeat the element of hostile use” could not be drawn solely from a landowner’s knowledge that a water line was being installed under a right of way that the landowner had leased to the defendant. In Burke-Tarr, not only did the landowner fail to object to the installation of the water line or to its continued use, but the landowner also testified that she did not know that the installed water line significantly exceeded the area specified in the leased right of way.

As a result, this Court held that, in the', '- 21 - absence of an objection, a landowner’s mere awareness of how his or her land is used is insufficient to establish express or implied permission which could negate hostile use.

This Court specified that “[m]ere acquiescence or silence, however, in the face of uses that are inconsistent with the true owner’s property rights, does not constitute permission.” Id. In Reitsma, this Court concluded that “no inference of permission from [the defendant] could be drawn from the mere fact that [the defendant] allowed the use to continue.” Id.', 'In this case, the trial justice noted that he was “not convinced that the owners or the employees of the parties knew the exact location of the easement at the time that Butterfly was using the disputed area.” Indeed, neither Charles Sposato nor James Romanella, the current owners of JR & Sons, was aware that there even was an easement. Nonetheless, the evidence presented at trial established that tractor-trailer trucks regularly made deliveries to the loading dock via the brown route and the green route, in violation of the terms of the express easement for over twenty years, which is well in excess of the statutory period necessary to establish a prescriptive easement. The evidence also established that the current owners of JR & Sons had no idea that there was an express easement, along with its prohibition against semi-trailer trucks that was filed in the land evidence records. The record also shows that no express permission was given to plaintiffs to traverse lot No. 330 using the green and brown routes, nor was there ever an objection raised by defendant to this use.', '- 22 -', 'Charles Sposato and James Romanella testified that each owned twenty-five percent of JR & Sons when Albert Romanella conveyed the property—and JR & Sons granted the easement—to Butterfly Realty in 1985. Their testimony indicates that they were uninformed and ignorant of the details of this transaction. Sposato testified that since that time, it was always his belief that Butterfly Realty should pay JR & Sons for its use of lot No. 330, and claims to have expressed this belief to Albert Romanella. Sposato did not disclose how Albert Romanella responded to this request.', 'Sposato testified that after Albert Romanella died in 2004, he considered asking for rental payments, but never approached anyone from Butterfly Realty. Nonetheless, he testified at trial that, consistently for the past twenty-five years, he unequivocally believed that Butterfly Realty should be paying rent to JR & Sons for its use of lot No. 330:', '“Q: But your testimony is that for twenty-five years you thought', 'they should have been paying rent; correct?', '“A: No question about it.', '“Q: And your attitude about it never changed in that twenty-five', 'years?

We didn’t do it.” This testimony is not that of a friendly neighbor.', 'In his deposition, Sposato claimed that an oral agreement existed between Albert Romanella and Mat Serra—who owned the liquor store on Butterfly Realty’s property prior to 1985—that allowed trucks to drive onto lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. However, when asked when this purported oral agreement was reached between Romanella and Serra, Sposato testified:', '- 23 -', '“I never had a date. I never knew of a date that it was reached.

We never bothered anybody.”', '(Emphasis added.) At trial, however, when asked whether he knew of any agreement in place that permitted delivery trucks to traverse lot No. 330 to access the loading dock, Sposato flatly replied, “Not at all.”', 'Although the majority claims that this nebulous testimony establishes that Sposato “apparently believed” that Albert Romanella had already granted plaintiffs permission to traverse lot No. 330, our case law is clear that a landowner’s subjective belief is insufficient to establish permissive use. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832. And, in this case, Sposato was wrong. Our law therefore requires, when confronted with Butterfly Realty’s “open, unsolicited, and long- continued use of the property,” that JR & Sons “affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.” Id.', 'The evidence, however, clearly establishes that defendant did neither. According to Shawn Martin, neither Albert Romanella nor Sposato ever voiced an objection to the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. Indeed, there was no communication between these neighbors on this issue for twenty-five years. Martin’s wife, Rita Martin—who', '- 24 - managed the liquor store from the time it opened in 1985 until its closing in 1989—testified that although she personally observed tractor-trailer trucks making deliveries to the loading dock, she had never received any written or oral communications from anyone affiliated with JR & Sons about the delivery trucks’ use of lot No. 330 to access the loading dock. Paul Williams, who worked in the auto parts store for fifteen years—from 1991 until 2006—explained that the auto parts store received weekly deliveries at the loading dock from semi-trailer trucks that were approximately fifty feet in length. Williams also testified that he never had a conversation with anyone affiliated with JR & Sons concerning the trucks’ deliveries to the loading dock. Finally, Craig Jackson, the owner of Auto Audio, testified that he also observed semi-trailer trucks at the loading dock on a weekly basis to make deliveries to the auto parts store. He maintained, however, that the only time he could recall deliveries being interrupted was when defendant installed the concrete pylons in 2010.', 'In addition, Sposato testified that, for more than twenty-five years, he personally observed tractor-trailer trucks traverse lot No. 330 to reach the loading dock on a weekly basis. He also testified that he never voiced an objection to plaintiffs’ use of lot No. 330, nor did he make any attempt to stop delivery trucks from using the lot to reach the loading dock. Curiously, in the event his building was damaged by a delivery truck, Sposato claimed he would speak directly with the driver, and not with Butterfly Realty or its tenants. Thus, the record in this case clearly shows that defendant never raised an objection to plaintiffs’ use of the disputed area as is required by our law. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832.', 'Moreover, the evidence in this case also does not support the majority’s conclusion that JR & Sons impliedly gave plaintiffs permission to use the disputed area, or that defendant’s actions rose above the “inactive status of quiescence or unqualified submission” that is', '- 25 - insufficient to support an inference of permission. Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832-33 (“Mere failure to protest is not permission but acquiescence. * * * Acquiescence is the inactive status of quiescence or unqualified submission to the hostile claim of another, and is not to be confused with permission, which denotes a grant of permission in fact or a license.”) (quoting Garrett v. Gray, 266 A.2d 21, 27-28 (Md. 1970) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)). In support of its holding that Charles Sposato and James Romanella “took affirmative steps consistent with an inference of permission,” the majority first points to the fact that Sposato would move his car for delivery trucks traversing lot No. 330. However, the record reflects that this action was not necessarily taken for the purpose of allowing access to plaintiffs’ loading dock. Rather, Sposato indicated that, although he would move his car so that traffic on lot No. 330 would not become congested, he could not identify whether the truck accessing the lot at the time was making a delivery to the Butterfly Realty building or to one of his own tenants. In fact, Sposato stated that vehicles—including tractor trailers—made deliveries to his own ten tenants on lot No. 330 by following the brown route. Likewise, when asked on cross-examination about the damage to his property—which he claimed was caused by deliveries made by tractor-trailer trucks to the Butterfly Realty building—Sposato admitted that vehicles making deliveries to his own tenants could have been responsible for the damage:', '“Q: I believe your testimony was to the effect that trailer trucks', 'making deliveries to the [Butterfly Building] caused the', 'concrete apron to break up; is that correct?', '“A: We believe the trucks going through there caused the concrete', 'ramp to break as you can see.

I don’t know which truck did it.', '“Q: Well, was it trucks servicing [Butterfly Realty] or was it trucks', 'servicing your tenants that caused that?', '“A: I couldn’t tell you. I really don’t know which truck. I said', 'trucks did that not the cars.', '“Q: But—so it could have been your own tenants’ deliveries that', '- 26 -', 'caused that problem?', '“A: Yes.', '“Q: And you also testified, did you not, that trucks had hit your', 'building?', '“A: Yes.', '“* * *', '“Q: Was that—could that also have been any truck that did so?', '“A: Could that also have been any truck? Of course.”', 'The majority also points to conversations that James Romanella purportedly had to support its holding that defendant “took affirmative steps consistent with an inference of permission.”', 'I believe, however, that the majority’s reliance on these conversations is misplaced, and similarly overlooks and misconstrues the material evidence presented in this case. For instance, the majority recounts that James testified in his deposition that, after instances in which his building was damaged by a delivery truck, he had two separate conversations with Paul Martin—first in 2001 and again in 2004—in which he claims that Martin apologized and promised “that he would make sure it didn’t happen again.” However, Paul Martin’s testimony at trial reveals that, from 1985 to 2003, he had no involvement in Butterfly Realty. In fact, Martin’s testimony reveals that he only acquired an interest in—and became involved in— Butterfly Realty in 2010.', 'Furthermore, events that occurred in 2001—sixteen years after Butterfly Realty acquired the property—and in 2004—nineteen years later—are well beyond the statutory time period necessary to establish prescriptive use, and therefore have no bearing on whether the use was permissive. See G.L. 1956 § 34-7-1.', 'Nonetheless, the majority points to yet another purported conversation that James Romanella recounted at trial, in which he claims to have received a call from one of Butterfly Realty’s tenants regarding whether delivery trucks could navigate lot No. 330 with the Christmas tree sales in place. This conversation occurred sometime during a twenty-year period:', '“Q: Now, at any time did you ever have any conversations with', 'anyone affiliated from Auto Zone regarding the Christmas tree', '- 27 -', 'operation that you just described?', '“A: Yes.', '“Q: When did this occur?', '“A: I’m not sure what year but obviously it was prior to 2005.', '* * * [I]t would [have been] between 1985 and 2005.', '“Q: Okay. Do you know if it was in the 1990s, in the 2000s?', '“A: I’m not sure.” Despite his inability to recall at what point in the twenty-year span this brief conversation occurred, Romanella detailed how he told the manager from Auto Zone “that it was my parking lot and that stand had been there year after year and it would continue as long as my tenant wanted to do it.”', 'In addition to relying on this nebulous testimony, the majority fails to recognize that this testimony at trial stands in stark contrast to James Romanella’s deposition testimony—which was introduced into evidence at trial—in which he declared that, aside from the two aforementioned conversations with Paul Martin, he never had any other conversations with Martin or any affiliates, tenants, or co-owners of Butterfly Realty—including Auto Zone and Auto Audio—until the concrete pylons were installed. Thus, the record does not support the trial', 'justice’s', 'conclusion—and', 'the', 'majority’s', 'affirmation—that', 'defendant’s', '“assent, accompanied with various restrictions, controlled the use of the area.”', 'Finally, the majority concludes that Sposato’s neighborly ways are what led him to never address anyone affiliated with Butterfly Realty or its tenants to voice an objection or stop the encroachment. Although the majority claims that Sposato “consciously refrained” from asking plaintiffs for compensation, the evidence presented at trial once again tells a different story. Sposato testified that it was always his belief that plaintiffs should pay for its use of JR & Sons’s property, but that he never asked for rent from Butterfly Realty until approximately six months before trial, when he telephoned Paul Martin and demanded that Butterfly Realty pay $900 per month for its tenants’ use of lot No. 330:', '- 28 -', '“Q: And your testimony here today is that you were voicing', 'objections about Butterfly Realty and their tenants using your', 'property to make deliveries and parking their cars twenty-five', 'years ago?', '“A: Did I?

But the first time you ever addressed this issue with', 'Butterfly was approximately six months ago; correct?', '“A: That’s what was prompted by what I told you because we', 'thought they were using our property to park on, using our', 'property to turn around on, coming up to the—and I said to my', 'partner [James], and we both discussed it, if they are going to', 'use that property they should pay us a rental and that brought', 'my call to Paul Martin which I did.”', 'In his deposition testimony, Sposato testified that, prior to this demand for rent money, he was unaware that there was an express easement from JR & Sons to Butterfly Realty, and was surprised to learn of the existence of the easement and of its terms. However, as soon as he learned about it, he made a hefty demand for $900 per month. When Butterfly Realty refused, JR & Sons installed concrete pylons along the express easement, making it impossible for any delivery vehicle to access the loading dock. When asked at trial why he installed the pylons, Sposato’s response was about money: “I was trying to get together with Paul Martin and come to some kind of agreement for them using all of our property all the time, that’s why I installed them so I’d obstruct the flow.” This testimony mirrored Sposato’s deposition testimony, in which he declared why he had the surveyor place an outline along the easement boundary: “Because we wanted compensation for using our property.”', 'These uncontroverted facts chronicle that Sposato—as an owner of JR & Sons—was not trying to be neighborly; rather, he always wanted to be compensated for the use of lot No. 330. Nonetheless, he was ignorant of the dimensions of his own land and did nothing. The plaintiffs', '- 29 - used the area in a manner adverse to his ownership rights for over twenty-five years. 1 Our case law is clear that JR & Sons’s failure to effectively communicate permission or objection to stop the prescriptive clock from ticking is fatal to a finding of permissive use. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832 (“When confronted with * * * an open, unsolicited, and long-continued use of the property, the true owner must affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.”); see also Restatement (Third) Servitudes § 2.17 cmt. c. at 265-66 (2000) (as acknowledged in the majority’s opinion, “[l]andowners are required either to formalize permissive arrangements, or to prevent use by others to avoid the risk that rights will be established by prescription”). 2 The evidence in this case clearly shows that defendant did neither. Thus, absent permission or objection to plaintiffs’ use, our case law is equally clear that defendant’s mere awareness that tractor-trailer trucks traversed lot No. 330 to access the loading dock is insufficient to establish implied permission to negate plaintiffs’ hostile 1', 'Curiously, although Sposato testified that he personally constructed the building that houses his office on lot No. 330, he claims to have never noticed the express easement on any engineering drawing used in this construction. 2', 'The majority cites § 2.17 of the Restatement (Third) Servitudes (2000) for the assertion that a recognized danger of prescriptive easements is their tendency to discourage “neighborly conduct and accommodation.” However, I believe that this language must be read in full context:', '“Prescription has both positive and negative effects.

See Burke-Tarr, 724 A.2d at 1020 (landowner’s testimony that she was unaware that the installed water line significantly exceeded the area specified in the leased right of way, coupled with her failure to object to the installation of a water line or to its continued use, was insufficient to show permissive use). The record in this case is clear that JR & Sons did nothing to stop plaintiffs’ adverse use until it was too late.', 'Moreover, I do not believe that this case presents the Court with an expansion of an express easement as the majority contends. It is undisputed that an express easement existed, permitting plaintiffs to access the loading dock from lot No. 330. However, it is also undisputed that the actual routes used by the delivery trucks—the green route and the brown route—did not follow, and occurred well outside of, the boundaries of the express easement, and operated in direct contravention of its specific prohibition against semi-trailers. I would therefore contrast this case from this Court’s holding in Hilley v. Lawrence, 972 A.2d 643 (R.I. 2009), in which this Court stated that “[w]hen permission is granted for a particular use, a later use of the same kind cannot be characterized as adverse.”', 'Id. at 652 (citing Stone v. Green Hill Civic Association, Inc., 786 A.2d 387, 390 (R.I. 2001) (emphasis added)). As a threshold matter, the use of lot No. 330 by tractor-trailer trucks was without permission, in violation of the recorded easement, and was adverse to the landowner. See Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228 (“[T]o constitute hostile use, the claimant need only show a use ‘inconsistent with the right of the owner, without permission asked or given, * * * such as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].’”) (quoting Tavares, 814 A.2d at 351). Moreover, despite the recorded easement’s express prohibition against semi-trailers, evidence presented at trial clearly established that these types of trucks frequented the loading dock for decades without objection by defendant. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832 (“Mere acquiescence or silence * * * in the face of', '- 31 - uses that are inconsistent with the true owner’s property rights, does not constitute permission.”). Moreover, I discern no evidentiary support for the trial justice’s conclusion—and the majority’s affirmation—that although the green and brown routes were used in full view of defendant, it “was done so with [its] permission.” See id. (“When confronted with * * * an open, unsolicited, and long-continued use of the property, the true owner must affirmatively communicate either objection or permission to stop the statutory prescriptive period from running.”). As such, I believe the plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that their use of lot No. 330 was hostile.', 'Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the trial justice erred in finding that there was implied permission for semi-trailer trucks to access the loading dock by traversing over lot No. 330 outside of the perimeters of the express easement. I am further unpersuaded that defendant’s mere knowledge that trucks were traversing the lot created an implied permission sufficient to defeat plaintiffs’ hostile use. See Burke-Tarr, 724 A.2d at 1019 (a landowner’s knowledge of how his or her land is used, without a grant of permission or objection, is insufficient to establish express or implied permission).', 'Finally, although I acknowledge the majority’s declared intention to charter “a consistent path by showing solicitude for the rights of record owners,” I believe it should do so on the basis of the evidence in the record. Simply put, this case centers on a record wholly barren of evidence to support the majority’s conclusion.', 'Continuous Use', 'Because I would hold that Butterfly Realty’s use of the claimed area was hostile, it is also necessary to address the parties’ arguments concerning continuous use before determining whether plaintiffs were in fact entitled to a prescriptive easement. See Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 588 (“One who claims an easement by prescription bears the burden of establishing ‘actual,', '- 32 - open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use under a claim of right for at least ten years.’”) (quoting Hilley, 972 A.2d at 651-52). In his decision, the trial justice determined that Butterfly Realty had “failed to establish continued use for a period of ten years,” finding that the yearly Christmas tree sales had interrupted the continuous use of the disputed area.', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred in finding that the Christmas tree sales interrupted plaintiffs’ continuous use of the area. I agree.', 'According to Rita Martin, for one month each year, during the Christmas season, tenants of JR & Sons would sell Christmas trees alongside the northern side of the laundromat. She described the area occupied by the trees as extending a “little beyond” the painted parking spaces located on the northern side of the laundromat. At trial, Mrs. Martin sketched the approximate area of the tree sales on a scaled map; according to her drawing, the trees did not overlap any part of the brown route. She explained, however, that the actual dimensions of the area occupied by the trees would vary slightly from one year to another. Nonetheless, she recounted that the tree sales never hindered deliveries to the loading dock.', 'Paul Williams also testified about his observations of the annual Christmas tree sales. He stated that the tree sales took place every Christmas season that he worked at the auto parts store, and ran from the end of November through December. Like Mrs. Martin, Williams sketched the location of the tree sales on a scaled map; this drawing depicted the trees encroaching upon the brown route, but not blocking the route entirely. Williams stated that he had personally observed trucks making deliveries while the trees were in place, but the trucks would have to “move[] over a little” to avoid the trees. According to Williams, the space in between the trees and the Butterfly Realty building was “a little tight,” but that a semi-trailer truck could access the loading dock. In fact, Williams insisted that the trees did not prevent the delivery trucks from entering', '- 33 - from East Avenue and reaching the loading dock.', 'As did Mrs. Martin and Williams, Craig Jackson, the owner of Auto Audio, also drew the area occupied by the Christmas trees on a scaled diagram. Jackson’s sketch indicated that the trees did not encroach upon any portion of the brown route, and, depicted the “average” size of the Christmas tree display, because it varied from year to year. Jackson testified that, despite the Christmas tree display, the weekly deliveries to his store were never interrupted until defendant installed the pylons along the southwestern boundary of the easement.', 'Sposato testified that the Christmas tree sales took place on the northern side of the laundromat almost every year from 1985 to 2006, and lasted for approximately one month from Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve.', 'When presented with Williams’s drawing, Sposato indicated that the drawing was a “good illustration” of the area occupied by the Christmas trees. When asked about the trucks’ ability to use the brown route while the trees were in place, Sposato stated, “[t]here’s no room for anybody to really get through there in my opinion.” He clarified, however, that he was “not saying that [the delivery trucks] didn’t at times go through there because obviously they did, but not conveniently.” Significantly, there was no testimony from James Romanella that the annual Christmas tree sales blocked access to the loading dock or that trucks were unable to pass over the brown route.', 'Our case law has recognized that one of the methods by which a record owner can interrupt a claimant’s continuous use of a disputed area is by “physical ouster of the claimant or a ‘substantial interruption’ of the claimant’s possession by the record owner.” Carnevale v. Dupee, 783 A.2d 404, 409-10 (R.I. 2001) (quoting LaFreniere v. Sprague, 108 R.I. 43, 52, 271 A.2d 819, 824 (1970) (emphasis added)). This Court previously has found that a landowner’s casual or passive attempts to interrupt a claimant’s continuous use were not sufficiently', '- 34 - substantial so as to amount to an interruption of continuous use. See, e.g., Carnevale, 783 A.2d at 411 (the mere act of making a claimant aware of surveyed boundaries is insufficient to substantially interrupt the claimant’s physical possession of the property); Jerry Brown Farm Association, Inc. v. Kenyon, 119 R.I. 43, 48, 375 A.2d 964, 966-67 (1977) (the placement of “a saw horse with a sign reading ‘Road Closed’ at the entrance to the road once a year,” when “the saw horse only covered a small portion of the road” and “[v]ehicles desiring access would simply go around the sign,” did not constitute substantial interruption); LaFreniere, 108 R.I. at 52, 271 A.2d at 824 (holding that performing a survey and giving notice to claimants of the proper boundary line did not constitute a sufficiently substantial interruption to halt the continuous use of the area, when claimants removed surveyor’s stakes and continued to use the area in a similar manner); see also 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses § 62 at 559 (2004) (“Ineffective interruptions, such as the erection of barricades and gates that are ignored or destroyed, will not prevent a use from ripening into [a prescriptive] easement.”). Accordingly, a landowner’s actions to break a claimant’s continuous use of a disputed area “must be such as to actually interfere with and interrupt substantially the claimant’s use of the land.” 3 LaFreniere, 108 R.I. at 53, 271 A.2d at 824.', 'In Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 591, this Court determined that the factual findings of the trial justice were inconsistent with his conclusion that the annual Christmas tree sales interrupted Butterfly Realty’s continuous use of the prescriptive area, and remanded the case with instructions to further examine the evidence and decide this issue. In the trial justice’s second 3', 'It is important to note that continuous and uninterrupted use by a claimant does not require constant use of the disputed area; “[i]t is necessary that it be continuous only in the sense that the claimant exercised a claim of right without interference at such times as it was reasonable to make a proper use of the land.” LaFreniere v. Sprague, 108 R.I. 43, 53, 271 A.2d 819, 824 (1970).', '- 35 - decision, he once again determined that the plaintiffs’ “use of the green and brown routes was not continuous for the statutory period of ten years,” based on similar findings that, because of the Christmas tree sales, tractor trailers “sometimes had more difficulty” accessing the loading dock area, although “[s]maller trucks and consumer vehicles were still usually able to make it through this narrowed passage.” However, there was no testimony or evidence presented at trial that the annual Christmas tree sales blocked access to the loading dock by delivery trucks sufficient to constitute an ouster. At best, the evidence suggested that the placement of the tree display merely made it inconvenient for trucks to access the loading dock. Inconvenience that does not rise to the level of physical ouster or substantial interruption as required by our case law is of no moment on the question of continuous use. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the trial justice erred when he found that the presence of the annual Christmas tree sales interrupted Butterfly Realty’s continuous use of the green route and the brown route.', 'Lastly, the plaintiffs argue that its tenants’ use of the claimed prescriptive area may be imputed to Butterfly Realty. However, after concluding that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claim for a prescriptive easement, the trial justice did not address on remand whether the various tenants’ use of lot No. 330 could be imputed to Butterfly Realty. Because the trial justice did not reach the issue of imputed use, it is therefore unnecessary to address it.', 'Conclusion', 'Based on the foregoing, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have established, by clear and satisfactory evidence, that their use of lot No. 330 was “actual, open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use under a claim of right for at least ten years.” Butterfly I, 45 A.3d at 588 (quoting Hilley, 972 A.2d at 651-52).', '- 36 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Butterfly Realty et al. v.

The defendant, DiGregorio, Inc. (defendant or DiGregorio), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Process Engineers & Constructors, Inc. (plaintiff or Process), granting the plaintiff’s claim for quantum meruit. After considering the written and oral arguments advanced by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'A series of contracts and subcontracts set the stage for this dispute. On November 28, 2005, Brown University (Brown) contracted with Bond Brothers, Inc. (Bond Brothers) for the replacement of high-temperature, high-pressure water pipes, designed to provide heat and hot water to buildings on the Brown campus. Brown preselected a ready-made, pre-insulated piping system manufactured by Perma Pipe, Inc. (Perma Pipe). On April 24, 2006, Bond Brothers', '-1- entered into a subcontract with DiGregorio, whereby DiGregorio agreed to furnish labor, materials, equipment, and services for the project. On the same day, DiGregorio entered into a sub-subcontract with Process, in which Process agreed to install the pipe. The sub-subcontract required that change orders must be in writing and signed by the owner, contractor, and architect.', 'Process installed the pipe. In the fall of 2006, however, the parties discovered that the insulation surrounding the interior of the pipe had become wet. 1 Process then replaced the damaged pipe and finished the work necessary to complete its portion of the project. In February 2008, Process filed this action against DiGregorio, alleging that DiGregorio failed to pay for some of the work that Process performed on the project. Process asserted breach of contract and quantum meruit claims against DiGregorio.2', 'On April 30, 2012, trial commenced before a justice of the Superior Court sitting without a jury. Three witnesses testified on that day. Robert Silvia (Silvia), the owner and president of Process, testified that Process was a subcontractor to DiGregorio on the project and that Process was to install “prefabricated conduit piping systems.” Silvia testified that there was a provision in the sub-subcontract regarding additional work or changes to the contract. Although Process never received any formal change orders, Silvia testified that Process was asked to and did perform work without a formal change order. Silvia discussed a number of invoices, which included change orders and relevant settlements and releases of holdback funds; ultimately, he 1', 'The overall project was marred by sand infiltration, which had the potential to damage the entire system and resulted in litigation between Brown and the many contractors. The record is not clear regarding whether the water damage to the pipe was discovered as a result of the investigation into the sand infiltration or whether sand infiltration was raised at trial merely to pinpoint the timing of the wet pipe issue. It is clear that the sand infiltration is not specifically relevant to this appeal. 2', 'The initial complaint also named Brown and Carolina Casualty Insurance Company, Inc. as defendants and included additional claims. A number of counterclaims, crossclaims, and third- party complaints also were filed. However, only the claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit by Process against DiGregorio proceeded to trial.', '-2- testified that Process was still owed $316,000. On cross-examination, Silvia acknowledged that he had no proof that the change orders noted in the invoices actually were approved. Additionally, when asked what Process was not paid for, Silvia responded, “I have no idea because we’d get checks and joint checks that weren’t even made out to us. There was never any documentation to show what was paid and what wasn’t paid.”', 'According to Silvia, three invoices from Process were termed “back charges”—the invoice for an additional performance bond premium, an invoice for the disposal of pipe fabrication that had been removed from Hope Street, and an invoice for the replacement of pipe sections that were reinstalled at Meehan Loop.', 'The plaintiff called Enrico DiGregorio, the president of DiGregorio, who testified as an adverse witness. He testified that DiGregorio withheld $148,694.51 from Process because it believed that Process was at fault for the water damage to the pipe. The witness, however, did admit that Process performed all of the work under the contract and that, at some point, the billing should have caught up and Process should have been paid.', 'Charles Barbanti (Barbanti), who was employed by Bond Brothers and was the project manager, testified during defendant’s case. Barbanti testified that Bond Brothers made the final determination of who would be paid and that Process was paid for its work on the project, including “legitimate change orders.” Regarding the wet pipe insulation, according to Barbanti, in addition to receiving it, welding it, and installing it, Process also was required to protect it and test it. Barbanti testified that, in his opinion, Process could have provided better protection to the pipe. Specifically, he stated that Process was “using like Saran wrap, which is like something you’d wrap a sandwich with,” and instead, he “felt they should be using six or eight mil poly”— a heavier grade plastic. According to Barbanti, Process should have duct-taped the end of the pipe when Process received it. On cross-examination, Barbanti admitted that the manufacturer', '-3- shipped the pipes in the “Saran wrap” material and that the “six or eight mil poly” may have exceeded the manufacturer’s specifications.', 'Barbanti also admitted that Process was not responsible for dewatering the trench, and that Process was entitled to rely on someone else to keep the trenches dry. He also stated that dewatering was included in DiGregorio’s scope of work.', 'The trial justice issued a written decision on July 13, 2012.3 Addressing the breach of contract claim first, the trial justice found that the provision of the sub-subcontract between Process and DiGregorio relating to the requirement of written and signed change orders was clear and unambiguous. The trial justice concluded that Process had “failed to satisfy its burden to show that the conditions precedent [with respect to the change orders] have occurred and thus the [d]efendant has not breached its subcontract by nonperformance.”4', 'The trial justice next addressed plaintiff’s quantum meruit claim as applied to three items: the change orders, the additional bond premium, and the pipe replacement necessitated by wet insulation. Regarding the change orders and noting the inconsistency of Silvia’s testimony, the trial justice found that plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of showing that plaintiff conferred a benefit on defendant and that defendant accepted the benefit. Next, the trial justice found that “[p]laintiff could recover the additional bond premium in the amount of $12,929.40, required by 3', 'Only one transcript filed with this Court predates the trial justice’s written decision—the transcript dated April 30, 2012, which contains the testimony described above. That transcript concludes with the trial justice stating, “Counsel, 9:30 tomorrow.” The trial justice’s decision states that the matter was heard over two days. The Superior Court docket sheet contains a number of entries for May 1, 2012 (but, notably, none for April 30, 2012). Article I, Rule 10(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure leaves it to the appellant to “order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant deems necessary for inclusion in the record.” The appellee may also request additional transcripts if he or she thinks that they are necessary.

Accordingly, the court concluded that Process “was able to show that the additional costs in replacing the damaged pipe were not attributed to [p]laintiff’s own inefficiencies or job preparation.”', 'The trial justice granted recovery as to two invoices in his written decision: the increase on the bond premium ($12,929.40) and the replacement of the damaged wet pipe ($72,857.96). On September 26, 2012, after hearing a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure filed by Process, the trial justice added an additional invoice in the amount of $8,295.68. The trial justice stated that the invoice was omitted from the written decision “through oversight.” On October 12, 2012, the Superior Court entered a final judgment in the amount of $94,083.04, which reflected all three invoices.', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.”', 'Wellington Condominium Association v.

The plaintiff contributes only that it “has no material issue with the facts and travel presented by the Appellant or as laid out in the Superior Court decision.” It is on this slate, with a meager record and no clearly articulated factual dispute, that we proceed to analyze whether “the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.”6 Lamarque, 22 A.3d at 1139-40 (quoting Cathay Cathay, Inc., 962 A.2d at 745).', 'DiGregorio raises two issues on appeal. First, it contends that the trial justice erred in relying upon Process’s opening statement as proof that it conferred a benefit on DiGregorio. Second, DiGregorio contends that the trial justice erred in awarding Process’s back charges that were not proven to be fair and reasonable or due and owing.', 'Quantum meruit, a Latin term for “as much as he has deserved,” is “[a] claim or right of action for the reasonable value of services rendered.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1361, 1362 (9th 5', 'We note the requirements of Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure: “In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury * * *, the court shall find the facts specially, and state separately its conclusions of law thereon * * *.” (Emphases added.) 6', 'The Court greatly appreciates clear and concise writing. However, it is also essential that the parties support their factual representations to this Court with citation to the record.', '-6- ed. 2009). Such an action permits recovery of damages “in an amount considered reasonable to compensate a person who has rendered services in a quasi-contractual relationship.” Id. at 1361- 62. This Court has stated that “[t]o recover on an action in quantum meruit, it must be shown that the owner derived some benefit from the services and would be unjustly enriched without making compensation therefor.” National Chain Co. v. Campbell, 487 A.2d 132, 135 (R.I. 1985). Although the term “unjustly enriched” appears as a requirement for recovery under a quantum meruit theory, we note the nuanced distinction between unjust enrichment and quantum meruit: “While unjust enrichment focuses on the propriety of a payee or beneficiary retaining funds or a benefit, quantum meruit’s primary focus is on the value of services rendered.” Parnoff v. Yuille, 57 A.3d 349, 355 n.7 (Conn. App. Ct. 2012). Quantum meruit generally applies “in a situation in which the plaintiff has provided services to the defendant for which the defendant has refused to pay.” Id.', 'Although we note the distinction between unjust enrichment and quantum meruit, both doctrines are quasi-contractual theories.7 See Multi-State Restoration, Inc. v. DWS Properties, LLC, 61 A.3d 414, 418 (R.I. 2013) (noting that “actions brought upon theories of unjust enrichment and quasi-contract are essentially the same”) (quoting Bouchard v.

C.E. Maguire, Inc., 610 A.2d 87, 97 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Hurdis Realty, Inc. v. Town of North Providence, 121 R.I. 275, 278, 397 A.2d 896, 897 (1979)).', 'The first issue raised by DiGregorio essentially attacks the sufficiency of the evidence presented by Process. The sum total of law cited by both parties, across four submissions to this Court on this issue, comes from a single paragraph in one of our opinions. The entirety of that paragraph is as follows:', '“Assuming that the fair value of the job turned out to be', 'more than the contract price, plaintiff failed to show that any of the', 'excess value was due to defendant’s actions, a changed condition,', 'or an unforeseen condition. To recover plaintiff must attribute its', 'loss to something other than its own actions. There is nothing in', 'the record to suggest that plaintiff merely underbid the contract, or', 'that plaintiff’s own decision to grout to two feet below ground', 'elevation and to grout the backfill resulted in its extra costs.', 'Furthermore, plaintiff failed to show that excess costs were not', 'attributable to plaintiff’s own inefficiencies, poor job preparation,', 'and management techniques.” Fondedile, 610 A.2d at 97. DiGregorio argues that this paragraph means that, to recover in quantum meruit, Process was required to prove that (1) the excess costs were due to defendant’s actions, a changed condition, or an unforeseen condition; (2) its loss was attributable to something other than its own actions; and (3) the excess costs were not attributable to plaintiff’s own inefficiencies, poor job', '-8- preparation, and management techniques.8 Process contends that this paragraph means that Process only had to prove the second and third elements above—basically proof by plaintiff that the loss was not plaintiff’s fault. Reduced to its core, the question is whether Process only had to prove that it was not responsible for the loss or whether Process also had to prove what caused the loss. We hold that Process was required to prove only that it was not at fault for the loss; it did not need to prove who was at fault.', 'We are satisfied that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s finding that Process “was able to show that the additional costs in replacing the damaged pipe were not attributed to [p]laintiff’s own inefficiencies or job preparation.” From the testimony and arguments of the parties, this Court can cull out three undisputed facts: it was Process’s responsibility to “protect” the pipe, it was DiGregorio’s responsibility to “dewater” the trench where the pipe was laid, and the insulation within the pipe got wet.9 The trial justice’s conclusion that damage to the pipe was not the fault of Process is supported by the following evidence: the pipes were transported via truck with a plastic protectant that the manufacturer provided to protect the pipe; a higher grade protectant may have exceeded the manufacturer’s specifications; Process was not responsible for 8', 'According to DiGregorio, these requirements were in addition to proof that Process actually repaired the pipe, which DiGregorio does not appear to challenge, and that the related charges were reasonable, which is discussed below. 9', 'From our review of the record, except for Barbanti’s opinion about Process’s protection of the pipe, there is little elaboration on the meaning of “protect” or “dewater,” or where one responsibility begins and the other ends. This is another gap in the record that makes this case difficult for the Court. In their supplemental Rule 12A statements on appeal, the parties began arguing about what constitutes “hydrostatic testing.” DiGregorio stated that “no one disputes” that a hydrostatic test involves water. Process responded, “The hydrostatic test uses air, not water,” and cited to a portion of the transcript, which discussed an air pressure test, not a hydrostatic test. This Court need not, and will not, decide the details of hydrostatic testing and its relevance to this case because the record is devoid of competent evidence on the issue. The lesson here is that when parties come to this Court with a deficient record, this Court’s ability to comprehensively analyze the issues is difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, we are stuck with this record and will render a decision based only upon it.', '-9- dewatering the trench; and Silvia testified that “[t]he way [the pipe] was designed, there was no way you could keep it free of water cause of the traps” and that the ends of the inside pipe were not supposed to be capped.10 From this evidence, the trial justice reasonably could find that Process sufficiently protected the pipe, such that the excess costs were not attributable to Process. This Court will not disturb that finding. See Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599 (noting that this Court will not substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial justice if competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings). Although the trial justice noted that a rainstorm had occurred, as mentioned during Process’s opening statement and no proof of rain was presented at trial, Process was not required to prove how the pipe was damaged or that it was DiGregorio’s fault. Process’s burden was only to show that it was not its own fault.', 'The second issue raised by DiGregorio attacks the evidence offered at trial supporting the amounts awarded in the judgment. DiGregorio argues that Process’s back charges were not proven to be fair and reasonable or due and owing. We are satisfied that Process put forth sufficient evidence for the trial justice to conclude that the back charges were due and owing. The invoices on which the trial justice based the relief granted were in evidence. Silvia testified that Process was not paid for the work done on the replacement pipe, stating that he had attempted to obtain payment by sending an invoice. Additionally, DiGregorio’s answer to 10', 'Barbanti testified that Bond Brothers “may have” required protection levels in excess of the manufacturer’s specifications. After this statement, Barbanti was confronted with exhibit No. 2—forty pages of specifications. Barbanti flipped through it and stated, “I’d have to review the entire thing. I mean, just general language in there. Yeah, I did notice something. It says protect from damage, water, dust, material, equipment, apparatus under this division.” Asked about water and dust, however, he responded, “Just protection of materials, protection of materials.” The trial justice then identified a page in exhibit No. 2. However, exhibit No. 2 is not in the materials filed with this Court. The trial justice, as factfinder, was permitted to disregard this testimony because it was confusing and imprecise.', '- 10 - interrogatory number 2, which was read by Enrico DiGregorio at trial, stated that DiGregorio disallowed payment to Process because Process “failed to [keep the pipes dry] and the insulation and pipe had to be removed and reinstalled.” Enrico DiGregorio also testified that DiGregorio withheld $148,694.51.', 'DiGregorio also challenges the fairness and reasonableness of the costs of the services and asserts that it was Process’s burden to prove that the value of the service provided was fair and reasonable. For this proposition, it cites Iannuccillo v. Material Sand and Stone Corp., 713 A.2d 1234, 1240 (R.I. 1998). In Iannuccillo, 713 A.2d at 1240, we concluded that there was “no basis for defendants to pursue damages under a theory of quantum meruit because defendants realized the fair and reasonable value of their services in direct proportion to the amount of sand and gravel removed from the site.” Thus, the Court held that the party seeking quantum meruit had been compensated for the services rendered; it did not describe what type of proof was required to establish reasonable value in a quantum meruit action.11 See id.', 'Our cases have addressed the requirement that, in a quantum meruit action, the value claimed must be fair and reasonable. See Salo Landscape & Construction Co. v. Liberty Electric Co., 119 R.I. 269, 274-75, 376 A.2d 1379, 1382 (1977) (“[A]n owner or prime contractor who fails to pay an installment due on a construction contract is guilty of a breach that goes to the essence of the contract and that entitles the injured party to bring an action based on a quantum meruit theory for the fair and reasonable value of the work done.”); see also National Chain Co., 487 A.2d at 135 n.1 (“A representative of State Office Supply, from whom the wallcovering was purchased, testified at trial to the fair and reasonable value of the wallpaper.”).

6,: State v. : Antonio O. Whitfield. :,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case stems from the brutal, late-night beating of a young man that occurred on the East Side of Providence. The complainant suffered a head wound that required eight stitches, a severe concussion, a broken nose, and multiple lacerations and contusions over his entire body. After a four-day jury trial, the defendant, Antonio O. Whitfield (Whitfield or defendant), was convicted of two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault for his role in the fracas. On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to impeach his credibility with fourteen prior criminal convictions and (2) the trial justice erred by denying defense counsel’s motion to pass the case after the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of two witnesses during her closing argument. The parties appeared before this Court on February 25, 2014, pursuant to an order directing them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Michael Newell (Newell or complainant) lived in a third-floor apartment on Angell Street in Providence.', 'The basement of the building housed a club: the Liquid Lounge.', 'At approximately 3:30 a.m. on November 27, 2008, a friend of Newell’s—a bouncer at the Liquid Lounge—knocked on his door and asked whether Newell had a wire coat hanger because another Liquid Lounge employee, named Kelsey, was locked out of her car. Although he could not find a wire hanger, Newell went outside to assist Kelsey with her attempts to access her vehicle, which was parked in the driveway adjacent to the building.', 'Within minutes, Newell watched as another female employee left work and began walking down Angell Street toward her car. She did not walk far. A black Dodge Charger stopped on Angell Street and the occupants began shouting catcalls at the woman, who immediately turned around and began walking back toward the group gathered in the vicinity of Kelsey’s car, which included the complainant, Kelsey, three Liquid Lounge bouncers, and two patrons. Undeterred, the Charger reversed direction and pulled into the driveway where the group was standing. At that point, Newell and the bouncers told those in the Charger to leave. According to Newell, rather than depart, the occupants of the Charger responded by hurling unopened beer bottles at them from the rear driver’s side window.', 'Newell testified that as he approached the rear driver’s side door of the Charger, he was pulled through the window of the vehicle, and the Charger backed out of the driveway and sped forward about 150 feet. When the vehicle came to a stop, the door opened, and Newell fell to the ground. As he attempted to stand, he was struck in the temple with an unopened beer bottle and again fell to the ground. Newell was repeatedly kicked and stomped on his head and upper body by three individuals for an extended period of time. Newell testified that he knew that there were', '-2- three assailants during the attack because there were distinct sets of legs and feet simultaneously assaulting him; however, he could not see the faces of his attackers.1 According to Newell, the bouncers finally reached the Charger and attempted to intervene. Eventually, the police arrived on the scene; Newell was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he received eight stitches around his temple. Newell also suffered “a severe concussion, a broken nose, and multiple lacerations and contusions from head to toe.”', 'A Providence police officer and a Brown University security officer responded to the melee: Providence police officer Joshua Greeno (Officer Greeno) and Brown University security officer Nicholas Gonsalves (Gonsalves).', 'Gonsalves was on foot patrol—checking the University’s Environmental Lab—when he heard a loud commotion coming from Angell Street. Gonsalves testified that as he walked toward the noise, he saw a Dodge Charger stopped in the middle of the road and that individuals in the car and on the sidewalk were shouting at each other. Gonsalves testified that a beer bottle was thrown from the rear of the vehicle towards Newell, who was standing on the sidewalk.', 'Gonsalves then saw Newell approach the vehicle “towards the rear window” and “actually go into the vehicle,” at which time the car started to move and then abruptly stopped.2 Gonsalves testified that three men exited the vehicle: “[t]he driver, * * * a lighter-skinned male; a rear passenger, * * * also a lighter-skinned male; and a darker-skinned male, [from] the front passenger side, who later identified himself to police as Keeron Hardmon.” “Keeron Hardmon” was later identified as defendant, Antonio Whitfield. Gonsalves made an in-court identification 1', 'Newell also admitted that he had consumed about eight beers that night. 2', 'It is not clear from the direct examination of Gonsalves whether he was referring to the driver’s or passenger’s side rear window. Furthermore, in contrast to Newell’s testimony, during his cross-examination, Gonsalves testified that the car moved only one to two feet forward.', '-3- of defendant.3 Gonsalves testified that defendant threw a beer bottle at Newell, striking him in the face. He next saw a white male approach the vehicle from the sidewalk, and a fight ensued between Newell, defendant, “the other darker-skinned male,” and the white male who had just approached.4 Gonsalves testified that defendant and “the other male” got Newell and the other man onto the ground and began kicking them; the kicks were so forceful that Gonsalves could hear “knocking sounds” from his vantage point fifty feet away.', 'According to Gonsalves, he did not approach the fracas because his job was limited to that of a security officer with no arrest power; however, he broadcast a call to Brown University police.', 'Within minutes, a police cruiser approached with audible sirens.', 'At that point, Gonsalves saw two assailants return to the vehicle, while defendant fled on foot. The vehicle was stopped by police, and a Brown University police unit located defendant and brought him back to the scene for a show-up. Gonsalves identified him as one of the assailants.', 'While these events were unfolding, Officer Greeno arrived on the scene to find Newell on the ground. He then learned that the black Dodge Charger had been stopped by the police a short distance away, with two suspects in the vehicle and that the third suspect also had been apprehended.', 'After the close of the state’s case, defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal was denied by the trial justice. Before the start of the defense’s case, defense counsel inquired about whether the state intended to introduce defendant’s prior convictions, in the event he testified on 3', 'For clarity, when the officers refer to “Keeron Hardmon,” we will refer to that person as defendant because no identity issue was raised and defendant later admitted to having an ID bearing that name. 4', 'It is unclear who the “other darker-skinned male” is, given that Gonsalves initially testified that two “lighter-skinned” males and only one “darker-skinned male”—whom he identified as defendant—exited the vehicle.', '-4- his own behalf. The state sought to admit fourteen prior convictions, and defendant argued that the convictions were inadmissible under Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The trial justice, however, overruled defendant’s motion and allowed the prior convictions in accordance with Rule 609.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense and gave an account of the events that markedly differed from the state’s case. According to defendant, in the early morning hours of November 27, 2008, he had just left a club in Providence with two friends: Mario and Kenny. As Kenny proceeded down Angell Street, Mario was trying to talk to a girl, but she “was running away from something.” According to defendant, Kenny then reversed direction and pulled into a parking lot where there was a group of men. The defendant testified that the group of men started hitting the car and yelling obscenities. The defendant contends that, while he sat in the rear driver’s side seat, someone hit him in the face and then tried to pull him through the window. He did not, however, identify that man as Newell. At the same time, a similar altercation began through the front passenger window, but that passenger—presumably Mario— got out of the car. The defendant testified that he was unable to exit the vehicle because of the child locks, but that the door was opened from the outside. At that point, according to defendant, a fight erupted with him and Mario against four or five other people. The defendant admitted that he had a beer bottle in the car, but testified that it fell to the ground when he was pulled partially through the window. He denied throwing a beer bottle or striking anyone with it. The defendant testified that, during the altercation, he turned around “like when everybody went to go run back to the car, because there [were] so many other people, [and] the car was gone, Kenny had left.” Knowing that the police were coming, defendant testified that he ran away because he knew he had an outstanding warrant for failure to pay court fines.', '-5-', 'On cross-examination, defendant’s credibility was impeached through the introduction of his fourteen prior criminal convictions. The trial justice immediately gave a limiting instruction, informing the jury that evidence of defendant’s prior convictions could only be considered in relation to his credibility and not for propensity purposes. Additionally, on cross-examination, defendant stated that he did not give the police the name “Keeron Hardmon,” but that he had his cousin’s ID in his pocket, and the police took that ID as his. The defendant admitted that he did not correct the police officers’ misimpression regarding his identity because he was aware of the outstanding warrant for his arrest.', 'On two occasions during the prosecutor’s closing arguments, defense counsel objected and moved to pass the case. The defendant argued that the prosecutor’s remarks amounted to a comment on his right to remain silent and also alleged that the prosecutor had vouched for the credibility of Officer Greeno.5 The trial justice refused to pass the case, but stated that he would give a limiting instruction on both points.', 'Although defense counsel wanted a limiting instruction in the event the trial justice refused to pass the case, he argued nonetheless that he did not think that “there’s any instruction that can cure the prejudice that’s inured to Mr. Whitfield.” In addition to an instruction regarding defendant’s right to remain silent, the trial justice instructed the jury that the drawing of inferences and the assessment of credibility is a function exclusively reserved for the jury.', 'The defendant was found guilty on all counts: assault with a dangerous weapon (beer bottle), assault with a dangerous weapon (shod foot), and simple assault. After trial, defendant moved for a new trial, and the trial justice denied the motion. He was sentenced to four years at the Adult Correctional Institutions with six months to serve and three-and-a-half years suspended 5', 'The right to remain silent issue is not before us on appeal.', '-6- with probation on count 1; four years with six months to serve and three-and-a-half years suspended with probation on count 2, to run concurrently with count 1; and one year suspended with probation on count 3.', 'Additionally, defendant was ordered to complete an anger management program and to pay $5,178.58 in restitution for the victim’s medical bills.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard. See State v. Tetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011). A trial justice “has broad discretion in deciding whether or not to admit evidence of prior convictions under Rule 609.” Id. (quoting State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 718 (R.I. 2006)). “‘This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s finding regarding the admissibility of prior conviction evidence for impeachment purposes unless our review of the record reveals an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice’ that prejudices the complaining party.” Id. (quoting State v. Rodriquez, 731 A.2d 726, 731 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Similarly, “a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 789 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Suero, 721 A.2d 426, 429 (R.I. 1998)). This Court defers to the trial justice on such a motion because he or she “has a ‘front row seat,’ allowing him or her to ‘best determine the effect of the improvident remarks upon the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1207 (R.I. 1995)). “As such, the trial justice’s determination concerning the prejudicial effect of evidence and the jury’s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict are reviewed by this Court under an abuse of discretion standard.” Id.', '-7-', 'Analysis', 'Prior Criminal Convictions', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to impeach his credibility with fourteen prior criminal convictions. The defendant accumulated those fourteen convictions in less than five years after his eighteenth birthday. The convictions include possession of marijuana, operating under the influence of alcohol, resisting arrest, and numerous assaults and batteries, among other offenses. In his ruling, the trial justice considered defendant’s “series of crimes”—detailing the different types of offenses involved—and, although he was concerned about the jury’s potential consideration of the convictions as propensity evidence, he concluded that the potential danger to defendant could be cured by a limiting instruction at the appropriate time.', '“Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence permits the admission of a witness’s prior conviction to attack that witness’s credibility unless the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the conviction substantially outweighs its probative value.” McRae, 31 A.3d at 791. “In making a determination under Rule 609, a trial justice must consider the remoteness of the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as reflected by his or her criminal record.” Tetreault, 31 A.3d at 784. Rhode Island’s Rules of Evidence do not limit the types of prior criminal convictions that may be admitted to impeach a witness, as opposed to the more limited set of convictions set forth in Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, because this Court has declared that “the jury should be able to consider whether or not a person who has previously broken the law may have such disrespect for the law as to render him or her unwilling to abide by the oath requiring truthfulness while testifying.” State v. Remy, 910 A.2d 793, 798 (R.I. 2006).', '-8-', 'In 2011, this Court decided two cases on nearly the same issue as presented in this case. In Tetreault, 31 A.3d at 781-82, 783, the trial justice allowed the state to impeach the defendant with fifteen prior convictions which spanned sixteen years. On appeal, the defendant argued that eleven of the fifteen convictions were too remote and unduly prejudicial. Id. at 783. We agreed with the trial justice that “given defendant’s long and continuous record of criminal behavior throughout most of his adult life, the jury was entitled to consider the proffered convictions.” Id. at 784. Accordingly, we upheld the admission of the convictions “[i]n light of the defendant’s voluminous criminal record and the probative value of prior convictions as bearing on his credibility as a witness * * *.” Id.', 'In McRae, 31 A.3d at 791, the trial justice allowed the state to impeach the defendant with seven prior convictions. On appeal, the defendant argued that three different categories of prior convictions were inadmissible: convictions involving “assaultive behavior,” misdemeanor convictions, and a conviction for obtaining food or accommodations with the intent to defraud. Id. at 792-93. We held that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion as to any of the groups of crimes for impeachment purposes. Id. Specifically, although the defendant was charged with domestic assault, we held that the defendant’s prior “assaultive” convictions were no more prejudicial than those admitted in other cases decided by this Court. Id. at 792.', 'Here, because at the time of trial all of defendant’s prior convictions were less than five years old, none of the convictions were remote. While some of defendant’s prior convictions were for assault and battery—the same type of offense with which defendant was charged—we repeatedly have declared, most recently in McRae, 31 A.3d at 792, that the similarity of the prior offenses does not render them per se inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching a testifying defendant’s character for truthfulness. Finally, although his record was not as lengthy as the', '-9- defendant’s record in Tetreault, defendant nonetheless displayed his disdain for the law by accumulating fourteen adult criminal convictions before his twenty-third birthday. A crime spree spanning fewer than five years that resulted in fourteen criminal convictions is relevant on the issue of whether a testifying defendant will honor his oath to testify truthfully, given his demonstrated disrespect for the law. Thus, considering the factors set out in Tetreault, the prejudicial effect of evidence of defendant’s prior convictions did not substantially outweigh their probative value. In addition, we note that the trial justice gave a limiting instruction to the jury before the prosecutor asked a series of questions about his prior convictions. Accordingly, in these circumstances, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by allowing the state to impeach defendant’s credibility with his prior criminal convictions.', 'Motion to Pass', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred by denying defense counsel’s motion to pass the case after the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of two witnesses during her closing argument.', 'First, we must address whether and to what extent this issue was preserved. To preserve an objection to a prosecutor’s closing argument, defense counsel “must not only make an objection at the time, but must make a request for cautionary instructions * * * or move for a mistrial.” State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 964 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1141 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Although defendant contends that the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of Gonsalves, it is clear that defense counsel made no objection during the prosecutor’s remarks concerning Gonsalves. Defense counsel’s two objections, posited during closing argument, solely related to the prosecutor’s comments about defendant’s flight from the scene (which defendant does not contest on appeal) and the prosecutor’s comments about Officer Greeno', '- 10 - (which are discussed below). Therefore, the issue of the prosecutor vouching for Gonsalves is waived. See Horton, 871 A.2d at 964 (noting that the defendant must object at the time of the comment and either request a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial to preserve a claim of prejudicial error in a closing argument).', 'Regarding the prosecutor’s remark about Officer Greeno, it is the state’s position that the issue was not preserved because defense counsel failed to move for a mistrial or object to the trial justice’s cautionary instruction. Although the state contends that the transcript of the hearing at sidebar is clear on this point, we are not convinced. The defendant raised two objections in a single, mid-argument sidebar, and each objection separately was argued by counsel.', 'The trial justice declared that he would give a cautionary instruction as to each objection. Defense counsel immediately responded, “Just note, Judge, my exception. I don’t think there’s any instruction that can cure the prejudice that’s inured to Mr. Whitfield.” Because the trial justice’s ruling encompassed both of defendant’s objections, it is unclear whether defendant’s exception related to one objection or to both. We are cognizant of the setting: the parties and the trial justice were at sidebar, in the midst of a closing argument, during a criminal trial that spanned several days. A fair reading of defense counsel’s remark is that he was objecting to the trial justice’s refusal to pass the case and to give a cautionary instruction as to both of his objections. Therefore, we conclude that the issue was preserved for our review.', 'Satisfied that the issue properly is before us, we next address whether the prosecutor’s comments about Officer Greeno actually constitute vouching for the credibility of a witness. During closing argument, the prosecutor stated, “Do you think Officer Greeno, who appears, I would suggest to you, to be a very by-the-book officer, he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you, do you think he’s going to risk his career?” This sentence', '- 11 - contains two remarks of questionable appropriateness: the reference to Officer Greeno being a “by-the-book officer” and the reference to the risk to the officer’s career, presumably in the event that he gave false testimony. We address the latter instance first.', 'The proper divide between appropriate remarks about an officer’s credibility and improper comments regarding the impact of perjured testimony on an officer’s career can be difficult to discern. This tension was highlighted in a decision by the Court of Appeals of Maryland when confronted with the following closing argument by a state’s attorney:', '“You have to weigh the credibility of each individual. Who has a', 'motive to tell you the truth. The Officer in this case would have to', 'engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of', 'his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not', 'true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He', 'would have to perjure himself on the stand.', '“* * *', '“[Y]ou have to understand that Officer Williams has no motive to', 'lie, because he has everything to risk in this case. Because he', 'doesn’t have to go out and make up drug arrests. Because he has', 'plenty of legitimate drug arrests. There’s absolutely no incentive', 'for him to come in here and tell a story about Mr. Spain.” Spain v.', 'State, 872 A.2d 25, 28, 29 (Md. 2005). The court’s reaction to this argument was twofold. The court first declared that the prosecutor’s remarks regarding the officer’s motivation to lie did not constitute improper vouching because there was no expression of the prosecutor’s personal belief about the credibility of the officer and the comment did not “explicitly invoke the prestige or office of the State or the particular police department or unit involved.” Id. at 31. Nevertheless, the court also held that the prosecutor’s comments about the adverse consequences to the police officer’s career were improper:', '“Although the State is free to highlight the incentive, or lack of', 'incentive, of a witness to testify truthfully, courts consistently have', 'held that it is improper to argue that a police officer may be', 'deemed more credible simply because he or she is a police officer.', '* * * By invoking unspecified, but assumed, punitive', 'consequences or sanctions that might result if a police officer', 'testifies falsely, a prosecutor’s arguments imply that a police', '- 12 -', 'officer has a greater reason to testify truthfully than any other', 'witness with a different type of job. Although the factfinder', 'generally is made aware that a witness who is a police officer is', 'testifying as to events witnessed while on duty as a police officer, a', 'prosecutor must be careful not to insinuate that the credibility of', 'statements made in this capacity may be assessed at a level of', 'scrutiny other than that given to all witnesses.” Id. at 32.', 'We also find the First Circuit’s decision in United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2000) persuasive and evincive of the sensitivity regarding comments about a government agent’s career. In Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142, the court addressed a comment during closing argument of an Assistant United States Attorney that, if the jury believed a statement by a codefendant, the jury “would also have to believe that [a FBI agent who testified] would actually jeopardize [his] ten years [as an FBI agent].” The First Circuit began its analysis by analyzing whether this remark actually constituted vouching—it contained no statement of personal belief and the FBI agent’s service time was in evidence, yet the use of the term “jeopardize” in relation to the agent’s career, while falling short of vouching, did suggest “some knowledge outside the record of punishment that [the FBI agent] could receive for lying in court.” Id. The court declared:', '“[W]e hold that this kind of general appeal to believe the police or', 'FBI because of their history, integrity, or public service is', 'inappropriate, although not the worst offense that a prosecutor can', 'commit. While not vouching in the most familiar sense, it does', 'invite the jury to rely on the prestige of the government and its', 'agents rather than the jury’s own evaluation of the evidence; to this', 'extent, the argument presents the same danger as outright', 'vouching.” Id. (citing United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19', '(1985)).', 'Thus, although courts tend to allow a general reference to a specific officer’s credibility or lack of motive to lie, a prosecutor’s reference to the “risk” to an officer’s career should he or she commit perjury is not appropriate. See Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142; Spain, 872 A.2d at 32; see also United States v. McMath, 559 F.3d 657, 667 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that', '- 13 - prosecutor’s comment that police witnesses would lose their jobs if they lied was improper); People v. Adams, 962 N.E.2d 410, 414 (Ill. 2012) (holding that prosecutor’s comment that officer was “risking his credibility, his job, and his freedom” was improper).6 While a witness’s status as a police officer certainly mandates that he or she testify truthfully, we are mindful that, in the context of the criminal justice system, all witnesses are expected to give truthful testimony. We agree with the First Circuit’s evaluation that a comment during closing argument about the risk to an officer’s career may invite the jury “to rely on the prestige of the government and its agents rather than the jury’s own evaluation of the evidence.” Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the prosecutor’s rhetorical question about whether Officer Greeno would risk his career, while not vouching in the true sense, nonetheless was inappropriate.', 'Regarding the remaining portion of the challenged remark—“Officer Greeno, who appears, I would suggest to you, to be a very by-the-book officer, he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you”—we perceive no impropriety given the full context of the prosecutor’s comment. It is important to note that the prosecutor preceded her comment with “I would suggest,” and followed it with a reference to his demeanor on the witness stand: “he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you.” It is common to instruct the jury, as occurred here, that they may consider the appearance and 6', 'Notably, despite holding that the comments were improper, in none of these cases did the appellate court vacate the jury’s verdict for this reason. See United States v. McMath, 559 F.3d 657, 668 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that remark did not jeopardize the fairness or integrity of the trial); United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 142-43 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that prosecutor’s comment was harmless); People v. Adams, 962 N.E.2d 410, 416 (Ill. 2012) (holding that comments did not amount to plain error); Spain v. State, 872 A.2d 25, 34 (Md. 2005) (court was “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict”).', '- 14 - demeanor of a witness when assessing the witness’s credibility.7 Therefore, considering the whole of the prosecutor’s remark and the jury instructions, the argument that Officer Greeno appeared to be a “by-the-book officer” was merely a comment meant to draw the jury’s attention to his demeanor while testifying. Accordingly, that comment was not improper vouching.', 'Although we conclude that a portion of the prosecutor’s closing argument was akin to vouching, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err by refusing to pass the case. A trial justice is vested with considerable discretion when ruling on a motion to pass a case. See McRae, 31 A.3d at 789; State v. Nelson, 982 A.2d 602, 607 (R.I. 2009). The trial justice’s front- row seat at the trial places him or her in the best position to determine the effect of the remarks on the jury and the proper remedy for any prejudice. See McRae, 31 A.3d at 789. “As such, the trial justice’s determination concerning the prejudicial effect of evidence and the jury’s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict are reviewed by this Court under an abuse of discretion standard.” Id.', 'Here, the trial justice was faced with an objection to a comment that was on the borderline of improper vouching. In his cautionary instruction, the trial justice told the jury that findings of fact and assessment of credibility were exclusively within their province. Specifically, he stated,', '“I can assure you that no one, from the State to the defense', 'counsel, to the witnesses, have any inside information. There is no', 'magical formula with regard to credibility. The witnesses were', 'sworn to tell the truth; and the assessment of their credibility is', 'exclusively within your prerogative once the final 12 are chosen to', 'deliberate.” 7', 'In this case, the trial justice instructed the jury that they “may be guided by the * * * appearance of a witness, as well as the conduct and demeanor of that witness while testifying * * *.”', '- 15 - The Court presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions. State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996). We are satisfied that this cautionary instruction was sufficient to quell the effect of any prejudice caused by the prosecutor’s remark about Officer Greeno’s career. See Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142-43 (holding prosecutor’s remark harmless because “(1) * * * it was not a severe infraction, (2) * * * the court properly instructed the jury that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, and (3) the substantial weight of the evidence against appellants”); LaRoche, 683 A.2d at 1000 (concluding that instructions “were more than adequate to cure any possible prejudice that may have resulted from the prosecutor’s arguably overzealous remarks”); see also supra, note 6 (noting several appellate court decisions refusing to overturn jury verdicts for similar vouching remarks during closing argument).

7,": v. : Dell, Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In this putative class action, the plaintiffs allege that Dell1 violated the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), G.L. 1956 chapter 13.1 of title 6, and that Dell was negligent by improperly collecting sales taxes on certain services purchased in conjunction with the sales of its computer products. A justice of the Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of Dell on both counts. This case has been pending for more than ten years and thus far has resulted in two opinions of this Court. It is not over. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the negligence count and on the request for injunctive relief by the plaintiff, Nicholas T. Long. However, the grant of summary judgment on the DTPA count by the plaintiff Julianne Ricci is vacated. Additionally, we affirm 1', 'The named defendants are Dell Computer Corporation, Dell Catalog Sales Limited Partnership, Dell Marketing Limited Partnership, QualxServ, LLC, and BancTec, Inc. The nuances of the legal relationships among these entities were discussed in our previous opinions in this case. See Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074, 1076 (R.I. 2009); DeFontes v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1061, 1062 (R.I. 2009). In this opinion, “Dell” and “defendants” refer to the collective Dell entities (Dell Computer Corporation, Dell Catalog Sales Limited Partnership, and Dell Marketing Limited Partnership).', '-1- the Superior Court justice’s grant of the plaintiffs’ motion to strike the tax administrator’s affirmative defenses.2', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court discussed the facts of this case in detail in two previous opinions. See Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074, 1075-78 (R.I. 2009); DeFontes v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1061, 1062-65 (R.I. 2009). Therefore, we will only recount recent events and those facts that are necessary for context.', 'The named plaintiffs, Nicholas Long (Long) and Julianne Ricci (Ricci) (collectively and on behalf of the putative class, plaintiffs), purchased Dell computers in late 2000. Along with their computers, they also selected an optional service contract, which essentially amounted to an extended warranty on the computers.3 As the receipt for payment, Ricci received a three-page “acknowledgment” with her order.', 'The first item listed on the acknowledgement is a “Dimension 4100 Series, Pentium Processor at 866 MHz”—presumably the main computer component. The “Unit Price” and “Amount” set forth for this item were both “1,576.00.” The next thirty lines in the acknowledgement contained different item numbers and product descriptions, all of which set forth the “Unit Price” and “Amount” as “0.00.” Finally, a printer cable was listed with a “Unit Price” and “Amount” of “24.95.” A box on the front page of the acknowledgement summarized the charges. The computer, the printer cable, and a shipping and handling charge of $105 brought the subtotal to $1,705.95. The box also set forth that $233 of that amount was taxable, and thus a tax of $16.31 was added. The total paid by Ricci to Dell was $1,722.26. Ricci purchased her computer for personal use. 2', 'We consolidate the two appeals for purposes of this opinion. 3', 'These service contracts were actually third-party contracts, whereby third parties, including defendants BancTec and QualxServ, would handle any repairs. Long, 984 A.2d at 1076.', '-2-', 'Long received a similar “acknowledgment” with his order. Only the first line contained a “Unit Price” and “Amount”—both were “2,804.00.” The summary box added a shipping and handling charge of $35 for a subtotal of $2,839. The box denoted that the entire $2,839 subtotal was taxable and charged $198.73 in tax. Thus, Long ultimately paid a total of $3,037.73 to Dell. Unlike Ricci, Long purchased his Dell computer for business purposes.', 'This class action lawsuit commenced in May 2003.4 The crux of the complaint is that Dell charged both Ricci and Long sales tax on nontaxable services.5 The two-count complaint alleged that defendants violated the DTPA and were liable for negligence. In their prayer for relief, plaintiffs requested damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendants moved to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration, arguing that by accepting delivery of the goods, plaintiffs agreed to the terms and conditions agreement, which contained an arbitration provision. The Superior Court justice denied that motion and entered an order of final judgment on March 29, 2004. The defendants appealed from that judgment.', 'In March 2005, Dell requested a determination from the Rhode Island Division of Taxation regarding the application of the sales and use tax. The Division of Taxation responded with a letter ruling.6 The letter ruling, which was written by the Chief Revenue Agent, began its 4', 'Mary DeFontes initially filed this action, but she is no longer a plaintiff. See DeFontes, 984 A.2d at 1062, 1072. Long joined the suit as a plaintiff in July 2003. Id. at 1062. Ricci replaced DeFontes in June 2005, upon discovery that DeFontes was an employee of plaintiffs’ counsel. Id. at 1065. 5', 'There is no allegation that Dell retained the tax collected; it is undisputed that Dell remitted the tax collected to the state. 6', 'The Division of Taxation describes a “letter ruling” as follows:', '“A General Informational Letter, (commonly referred to as a ‘Letter Ruling’) is', 'unlike a Declaratory Ruling in that it generally seeks an interpretation of tax law', 'or regulation without applying it to a specific set of facts. A General', 'Informational Letter may be issued where it appears that general information only', '-3- discussion by referencing Regulation SU 00-126, entitled “Optional Service, Maintenance, and Extended Warranty Contracts,” which stated, inter alia, that “[t]he charge for the optional service, maintenance, or extended warranty contract is not subject to tax when such a charge is separately stated by the retailer to the purchaser.” The letter stated that “[t]he intent of the regulation is to exempt an optional service, maintenance, and extended warranty contract from sales tax when the contract is optional to the buyer, and the charge is separately stated by the retailer to the purchaser.” Initially, the ruling stated that when a Dell invoice or acknowledgment “provided to a customer showed a total sales price for all items in the order and a unit price of ‘0.00[’] for each individual item, including the service contract and extended warranty, the sales tax was properly applied to the total sales price.” Directly applying the facts here, however, the letter concluded, “Since the service contract is optional to the buyer and a separate charge under ‘taxable amount’ is noted elsewhere on the invoice or acknowledgement as being for a 3rd party service contract, [Dell] Catalog should not have imposed the sales tax.”', 'In March 2007, while the appeal of the order denying the motion to compel arbitration was pending, defendants moved for summary judgment. In response, plaintiffs requested that the Tax Administrator for the Rhode Island Division of Taxation (the tax administrator) be notified of the proceeding because defendants’ contentions on summary judgment implicated Rhode Island tax law. The tax administrator then moved to intervene in the case. The Superior Court justice permitted the tax administrator to intervene solely “for the purpose of appearing and', 'is requested, or where a request for a Declaratory Ruling does not comply with all', 'the requirements for a Declaratory Ruling. General Informational Letters may not', 'be relied upon by any taxpayer other than the taxpayer who requested the', 'information.

The Superior Court justice denied the motion to dismiss. The defendants and the tax administrator petitioned this Court for writs of certiorari to review the question of subject-matter jurisdiction, and we granted the petitions.', 'On December 14, 2009, this Court issued separate opinions on these preliminary issues. In DeFontes, 984 A.2d at 1073, we held that the Superior Court justice properly denied defendants’ motion to compel arbitration because plaintiffs did not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions in the shrinkwrap agreement contained in the computer’s packaging. In Long, 984 A.2d at 1081, we held that that the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the DTPA claim and ancillary jurisdiction over the negligence claim. We remanded the case to the Superior Court. Id. at 1082.', 'With the arbitration and subject-matter jurisdiction issues resolved, the Superior Court turned to defendants’ summary judgment motion. First, the Superior Court justice decided to consider only the facts and claims of the individual plaintiffs—not the purported class of plaintiffs—because the class had not yet been certified. Additionally, he noted that after his previous decision and this Court’s opinions, the only claims that remained as to Long were those seeking equitable or declaratory relief because Long’s claims under the DTPA and for negligence had been dismissed. Addressing those claims, the Superior Court justice concluded that the prayer to enjoin defendants from collecting improper taxes was moot because there was no evidence to suggest that defendants continue to improperly collect the tax. Accordingly, for purposes of summary judgment, the Superior Court justice considered “only the claims of', '-5- improper collection of tax on the optional service contract, as evidenced in Ricci’s acknowledgment of her purchase of a Dell computer, and the facts associated therewith.”', 'Next, the Superior Court justice concluded that Ricci should not have been charged a sales tax on her service contract. Although service contracts were not taxable in Rhode Island, Dell contended that Rhode Island Tax Regulation SU 00-126, which provided that “[t]he charge for the optional service, maintenance or extended warranty contract is not subject to tax when such charge is separately stated by the retailer to the purchaser,” nonetheless mandated that a tax be charged because Dell contends the “acknowledgement” it sent to Ricci did not separately state the service contract price. However, in its 2005 letter ruling, the Division of Taxation concluded that Dell’s “acknowledgement” did, in fact, separately state the service contract price, and Dell should not have taxed the service contract. Based on the letter ruling, the tax regulation, and the opinions of this Court, in particular language from our opinion in Long, the Superior Court justice found that Dell improperly charged Ricci $16.31 in sales tax on the optional service contract.', 'Having concluded that Ricci was improperly taxed, the Superior Court justice next addressed Dell’s legal arguments that it was nonetheless not liable under the DTPA or in negligence.7 Addressing the negligence claim, he concluded that “[a] seller’s duty with regard to the collection of sales tax is to the State, not the consumer.” He reasoned that the seller is subject to state penalties for failing to properly remit sales taxes to the state. Further, he noted that there is little incentive for a seller to over-collect taxes. Comparatively, any injury to a consumer is relatively minor. Finally, consumers now have an independent right to seek a 7', 'The trial justice concluded that three other theories—DTPA exemption for collection of sales tax, sovereign immunity, and unclean hands—did not preclude Dell’s potential liability to Ricci. Dell did not raise these issues on appeal.', '-6- refund if they are inappropriately taxed. Accordingly, the Superior Court justice concluded that Dell did not owe a duty to Ricci, and therefore Ricci did not have an actionable tort claim.', 'Turning to the DTPA claim, the Superior Court justice first addressed whether the practice was “unfair.” The court concluded that “Dell’s honest misinterpretation of a delicate area of the state tax law cannot be held to be an unfair act.” The Superior Court justice noted that Ricci did not come forth with any evidence tending to prove that Dell acted immorally or unethically. He also questioned whether Ricci’s monetary injury of $16.31 was “substantial.” Next, the court addressed whether Dell’s actions were “deceptive” under the DTPA. Although the Superior Court justice found that charging a sales tax constituted a representation that was misleading, he concluded that the misrepresentation was not “material” to constitute a deceptive act under the statute because it was so paltry as to have no effect on Ricci’s decision to purchase the product.8 Accordingly, the court concluded that “as a matter of law, Dell’s actions did not constitute negligence or violate the DTPA.”', 'In the same decision, the Superior Court justice also addressed plaintiffs’ motion to strike the tax administrator’s affirmative defenses.9 Noting that no claims had been asserted against the tax administrator and that the conditions precedent to the allegedly conditional defenses had not arisen in this case, the Superior Court justice struck the defenses as immaterial under Rule 12(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'On April 9, 2012, an order and final judgment entered, granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment and plaintiffs’ motion to strike. The plaintiffs appealed the order granting 8', 'The Superior Court justice drew this conclusion from Ricci’s deposition testimony, where she stated that she did not care about the sales tax, only the total price of the computer. 9', 'The affirmative defenses were (1) statute of limitations; (2) unclean hands; (3) “he who demands equity must do equity”; (4) setoff and recoupment; (5) statutory setoff; (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; and (7) failure to exhaust administrative remedies.', '-7- summary judgment to defendants, and the tax administrator appealed the order striking his affirmative defenses.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 149-50 (R.I. 2012)). We examine the case “from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, [and] ‘[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party * * *.’” Id. (quoting Sacco, 53 A.3d at 150). In performing this review, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. See Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 424-25 (R.I. 2013) (noting that “the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom” are viewed “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party”) (quoting Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 126-27 (R.I. 2012)). “Ultimately, the ‘purpose of the summary judgment procedure is issue finding, not issue determination.’” DeMaio v. Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 130 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 391 (R.I. 2008)). Summary judgment is appropriate only when “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and * * * the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.” Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 506 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Plunkett v. State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005)). If the evidence submitted permits an inference that creates a genuine issue of material fact, the motion must be denied. See DeMaio, 59 A.3d at 132 (holding that a Superior Court justice may not choose between conflicting inferences at summary judgment stage).', '“[S]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Cruz v. DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp., 66 A.3d 446, 451 (R.I. 2013) (quoting DeMaio, 59 A.3d at 129).', '-8-', 'Furthermore, this case presents the issue of whether, for purposes of a motion for summary judgment, the Court should treat the alleged class as certified, or whether the Court should only consider the facts pertaining to the named plaintiffs.10 At the outset of his analysis, the Superior Court justice stated, “Because the class is not certified, this Court will consider the [m]otion on the facts and claims of the individually-named Plaintiffs, and not those of any purported class.” The defendants contend that this is the correct approach and cite federal case law purporting to support that proposition. The plaintiffs, however, argue that the Court must treat the class as certified because the Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party at the summary judgment stage.', 'This Court previously has stated that, “[b]ecause we review this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs [i.e., the nonmoving party], to the extent that it relates to our decision, we treat this case as though it were certified as a class action.” Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 679 n.12 (R.I. 2004). We adhere to that reasoning in the case at bar. Such a rule is most consistent with our summary judgment jurisprudence, which requires that, when performing de novo review, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Sullo, 68 A.3d at 406. Furthermore, this approach promotes the class action objectives of compensation for small injuries and efficiency.', 'See 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 1:7 at 17-21 (5th ed. 2013) (noting that, when individual claims are for small amounts of money, a class action is the only practical means to 10', 'The defendants contend that plaintiffs waived this issue by failing to claim it as a ground of error in their opening brief. We disagree. Although plaintiffs did not address the issue in the context of the standard of review, they did contend that it was “plain error” for the Superior Court justice to question whether the improperly charged sales tax caused substantial injury because the class had not been certified; for this proposition, plaintiffs cited Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 679 n.12 (R.I. 2004). Thus, we are satisfied that plaintiffs sufficiently raised the issue, and it is appropriately before the Court.', '-9- seek compensation); id. § 1:9 at 26 (“Aggregate litigation promotes administrative efficiency.”). This principle of treating the class as certified, however, does not mean that a plaintiff can simply multiply a small injury to an individual plaintiff by a large number with no basis in fact. There must be evidence in the record from which a factfinder could infer facts that may apply class-wide.', 'The legal basis underpinning the cases cited by defendants is that a precertification ruling does not bind absent class members. While that is true, we decline to draw the conclusion that such a rule then compels this Court to disregard the procedural standard when confronted with a summary judgment motion. The question of who will be bound by a judgment is markedly different from the question of what is the appropriate decisional standard. Furthermore, none of the cases cited by defendants addresses the unique summary judgment issue that confronts us in this case. In Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357-58 (1996), the United States Supreme Court merely commented that the named plaintiffs in a class action must have standing. Also, the Court was reviewing a bench trial; it was not reviewing a summary judgment ruling. Id. In Jackson v. Resolution GGF Oy, 136 F.3d 1130, 1132 (7th Cir. 1998), the Seventh Circuit dismissed a defendant because no individual plaintiff had standing against that defendant; again, the summary judgment standard was not a concern. Finally, defendants cite a quote from an unreported trial court decision, Evans v. Taco Bell Corp., CIV. 04CV103JD, 2005 WL 2333841, at *3, *4 (D.N.H. Sept. 23, 2005), that was made in the context of a motion to strike. There, the court refused to consider a doctor’s affidavit that contained a medical opinion regarding a person who was not a plaintiff because the class was not yet certified. Id. at *4. Although the court in Evans went on to address a summary judgment motion, the relevant issue in that case was direct evidence submitted regarding a nonparty in an uncertified class action. Id. Treating a class as', '- 10 - certified for summary judgment purposes—and thus permitting an inference of class-wide injury from facts in the record—is different from submitting evidence regarding a specific person or entity that is not a party to the case.', 'We pause to note that the timing of class certification is a complex question which depends on the circumstances of each case. See 3 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 7:8 at 38 (5th ed. 2013) (“Given that policy concerns cut different ways in different circumstances, a court’s decision to consider dispositive motions before or after a ruling on class certification depends greatly on the individual circumstances of the particular case.”); id. § 7:10 at 48-58 (discussing factors to evaluate timing of class certification to summary judgment). Our conclusion in this case should not be read as an endorsement of delayed class certification. We accord great deference to a Superior Court justice’s decision to certify a class. DeCesare v. Lincoln Benefit Life Co., 852 A.2d 474, 487-88 (R.I. 2004) (“A trial court’s decision to certify a class is accorded great deference and will not be disturbed unless the trial court misconceived material evidence, substantially abused its discretion or was otherwise clearly wrong.”). Given the long duration of this case, however, we must remind the parties that Rule 23(c)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure contains a timeliness requirement. See Zarrella v. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1249, 1262 n.16 (R.I. 2003) (discussing timeliness requirement). While we previously have looked to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for interpretative guidance, we also note that this state has not adopted the 2003 amendments to the federal rule, with its more liberal timeliness requirement. Compare Super. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) (“As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained.”), with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A) (“At an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class', '- 11 - representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.”). But cf. 3 Rubenstein, § 7:5 at 24 (“By excising the ‘as soon as’ formulation, the new language gives courts more time to address certification, bringing the rule in line with what had become a de facto practice even under the older, more urgent language.”).', 'Analysis', 'I', 'Motion for Summary Judgment', 'Negligence', 'In count 2 of the complaint, plaintiffs allege that Dell breached its duty “to properly calculate and collect sales tax * * * due on purchases made by Rhode Island residents and businesses.” The defendants argue that no such duty exists, and, therefore, the Superior Court justice properly granted summary judgment to defendants on count 2.', '“To properly set forth a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.” Brown v.

The state further effectuates the payment of taxes by retailers through a number of penalties for failure to properly remit sales taxes to the state. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 44-19-12 (10 percent penalty for deficiency “due to negligence or intentional disregard of [sales and use tax provisions]”); § 44-19-31 (A retailer may be, “in addition to any other penalties in this chapter or elsewhere prescribed, guilty of a felony, punishment for which is a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or imprisonment for one year, or both.”).', 'Thus, the retailer’s duty with regard to the tax is to the tax administrator, not the consumer.', 'The plaintiffs contend that G.L. 1956 § 44-18.1-26, entitled “Customer refund procedures,” “constitutes a legislative acknowledgement that Rhode Island law already allow[ed] a purchaser to seek a return of over-collected sales or use tax from the seller.” Section 44-18.1- 26 provides:', '“Customer refund procedures.', '“(A) These customer refund procedures are provided to', 'apply when a state allows a purchaser to seek a return of over-', 'collected sales or use taxes from the seller.', '“(B) Nothing in this section shall either require a state to', 'provide, or prevent a state from providing, a procedure by which a', 'purchaser may seek a refund directly from the state arising out of', 'sales or use taxes collected in error by a seller from the purchaser.', 'Nothing in this section shall operate to extend any person’s time to', 'seek a refund of sales or use taxes collected or remitted in error.', '“(C) These customer refund procedures provide the first', 'course of remedy available to purchasers seeking a return of over-', '- 13 -', 'collected sales or use taxes from the seller.

See P.L. 2006, ch. 246, art. 30, §§ 12, 21.

Dell argues that its practice of charging sales tax was neither unfair nor deceptive and that it was merely following its understanding of Rhode Island tax law at the time. The Superior Court justice granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs’ DTPA claim.', 'The DTPA provides that “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are declared unlawful.” Section 6-13.1-2.

Unfair', 'To determine whether a trade practice is “unfair” under the DTPA, this Court has stated that the following factors apply:', '“(1) Whether the practice, without necessarily having been', 'previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has', 'been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise—', 'whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some', 'common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness;', '(2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous;', '(3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or', 'competitors or other businessmen).” Ames v. Oceanside Welding', '- 16 -', 'and Towing Co., 767 A.2d 677, 681 (R.I. 2001) (quoting FTC v.', 'Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 244-45 n.5 (1972)).12 The plaintiffs need not establish every factor, and they may prove unfairness by showing that a trade practice meets one factor to a great degree or two or three factors to a lesser degree. See Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. v. Montes, 612 A.2d 1130, 1143-44 (Conn. 1992) (“All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.”) (quoting Statement of Basis and Purpose, Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures, 43 Fed. Reg. 59,614 and 59,635 (1978)). 12', 'The Superior Court justice applied these factors, and both parties present their DTPA arguments in their briefs by applying these factors. Therefore, we will apply these factors here. Nevertheless, we pause to note that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) adjusted its interpretation of unfairness in a 1980 Policy Statement. See FTC Policy Statement on Unfairness, appended to In re International Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949, 1070 (1984). Additionally, in 1994, Congress further defined the FTC’s role in determining an unfair trade practice:', '“Standard of proof; public policy considerations', '“The Commission shall have no authority under this section', 'or section 57a of this title to declare unlawful an act or practice on', 'the grounds that such act or practice is unfair unless the act or', 'practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers', 'which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and', 'not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to', 'competition. In determining whether an act or practice is unfair,', 'the Commission may consider established public policies as', 'evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public', 'policy considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such', 'determination.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(n). What effect the FTC’s 1980 policy statement and 15 U.S.C. § 45(n) have on the unfairness analysis is not before us.', '- 17 -', 'Addressing the first factor, the Superior Court justice concluded that Dell’s collection of sales tax on a nontaxable item offended public policy. We agree. Statutes passed by the Legislature are the state’s declaration of public policy. Thus, acting in contravention of those laws, as Dell clearly did, violates public policy.13', 'Regarding the second factor, the Superior Court justice concluded that Dell’s actions were not “immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous.” The Superior Court justice accepted Dell’s argument that “the charge of sales tax on the optional service contract sold to Ricci was a good faith, reasonable interpretation of the tax law and regulations in effect.” Further, he stated that “Dell’s honest misinterpretation of a delicate area of the state tax law cannot be held to be an unfair act.” Dell takes this conclusion even a step further in its brief by arguing that the DTPA requires evidence of bad faith. This is incorrect. The DTPA does not require a showing of bad faith. It only requires an “unfair or deceptive” act or practice. Section 6-13.1-2. While trade practices undertaken in bad faith are also likely to be unfair or deceptive, bad faith is not the statutory standard.14', 'Whether Dell’s sales tax calculation and collection practice was in good faith and resulted in an honest misinterpretation is a question of material fact. Dell certainly can argue to a jury that it was acting under a good faith interpretation of tax law and therefore its conduct was not unfair. However, a jury could also draw the inference that Dell’s efforts to avoid its own tax nexus with Rhode Island unfairly resulted in consumers being charged for taxes that they should 13', 'We note that, on appeal, Dell did not challenge the Superior Court justice’s determination that it was improper for Dell to charge Ricci a tax on the optional service contract. 14', '“Bad faith” is defined as “[t]he malicious intention to be dishonest or to violate the law, as in negotiations over a contract.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 133 (5th ed. 2011). Neither “unfair” itself nor its elaborative siblings—immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous—carry a connotation of malice necessary to show “bad faith.”', '- 18 - not have been charged.15 Although taking steps to avoid a tax nexus to the state is not illegal, if those steps include overcharging consumers in order to achieve that goal, a factfinder can determine the weight of such evidence on the ultimate question of whether Dell’s trade practice was unfair under the DTPA.', 'Additionally, the record contains internal records from Dell which make clear that Dell allocated a certain value to the service contracts. Yet, Dell chose not to clearly list that value in its acknowledgments sent to consumers. Nevertheless, Dell charged a sales tax on only the service contract value, and not the full purchase price. We note that a consumer could take a number of steps to figure out the service contract price: on the acknowledgement, the line items for the service contract include asterisks; the asterisk denotes, “service contract may be subject to sales tax”; and the first page of the acknowledgment states, “Dell Catalog Sales collects tax only in FL, KY, NC, NV, TN & TX. For other states the tax shown relates only to 3rd party service contracts and the buyer is responsible for remitting any additional tax directly to the taxing authorities.”16 But it is for a jury to decide which inference to draw from Dell’s decision not to state clearly the service contract price on its acknowledgment.', 'Indeed, a factfinder could conclude that Dell deliberately omitted the price of that item, resulting in a tax to the consumer in order to avoid a tax nexus for its own products. Accordingly, under the second factor in Ames, a jury could find that Dell’s improper collection of sales tax was immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous. See Ames, 767 A.2d at 681; see also Long, 984 A.2d at 1081 15', 'Dell did not have a tax nexus to Rhode Island and therefore was not registered with the Department of Taxation. However, BancTec, a third party contractor that serviced Dell products under optional service contracts purchased by Dell’s customers, did have a tax nexus to Rhode Island. Under agreements between Dell and BancTec, Dell was required to collect any applicable sales and use tax on BancTec’s behalf. 16', 'It was this combination of information that led the letter ruling to conclude that the service contract price was, in fact, separately stated for tax collection purposes.', '- 19 - (noting liberal construction of DTPA); Park, 844 A.2d at 692 (noting legislative intent “to declare unlawful a broad variety of activities that are unfair or deceptive”).', 'Regarding the third factor, the Superior Court questioned whether Ricci’s $16.31 loss constituted a substantial injury. Our conclusion regarding the standard of review becomes crucially important on this point. If the only injury to be considered in the light most favorable to plaintiff was $16.31, we may well agree with the Superior Court justice. However, because we treat the class as certified for purposes of drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and viewing evidence in the most favorable light to the nonmoving party, we will consider the evidence in the record of potential injury to the class. Chavers, 844 A.2d at 679 n.12. The record contains multiple claims filed with the tax administrator for refunds of sales taxes remitted by multiple defendants. Dell Marketing LP claimed a refund of $900,000 for the period October 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003. BancTec, Inc. claimed a refund of $540,454 for the period October 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003.', 'QualxServ, LLC claimed a refund of $145,451.07 for the period January 1, 2002 to October 30, 2004. All of these refund claims were prepared by the same attorney and all contained an explanation that they were “protective claim[s]” related to the outcome of this litigation. Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a factfinder could infer an injury of over $1 million to the class. An injury of such monetary magnitude certainly qualifies as substantial.17 17', 'The dissent draws a distinction between treating the plaintiff class as certified for purposes of summary judgment (on which the dissent takes no position) and aggregating the damages of the plaintiff class (on which the dissent disagrees). First, we reiterate that the aggregation to which the dissent refers is not automatic or culled out of thin air; an inference of class-wide injury can be drawn from competent evidence before the trial justice. Regardless, if the class is treated as certified, for purposes of viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party on summary judgment, an inference of class-wide injury should be drawn when competent evidence permits. Under the dissent’s view, a named plaintiff in a class action must provide evidence that he or she individually suffered “substantial” injury by a trade practice of the', '- 20 -', 'Therefore, a factfinder could conclude that Dell’s sales tax calculation and collection practice offended public policy, was immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous, and caused substantial injury to consumers. Given that all three factors could weigh in favor of plaintiffs, a factfinder could conclude that the trade practice was unfair under the DTPA.', '2. Deceptive', 'Although this Court has not defined a “deceptive” act or practice under the DTPA, we are statutorily required to accord great weight to the FTC’s interpretation of § 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and therefore we adopt that standard. Section 6-13.1-3. Therefore, to prove that a trade practice is deceptive under the DTPA, a plaintiff must set forth three elements: “[1] a representation, omission, or practice, that [2] is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and [3], the representation, omission, or practice is material.”18 F.T.C. v. Verity International, Ltd., 443 F.3d 48, 63 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting In re Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 165 (1984)). “The deception need not be made with intent to deceive; it is enough that the representations or practices were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably.” Id.', 'The Superior Court justice found that “Dell represented that there was sales tax, misleading the consumers who paid the tax,” but that the sales tax portion of the purchase price was not material under the DTPA because it had no effect on Ricci’s choice to purchase the product. Thus, the Superior Court justice found that Dell’s sales tax collection practice was not deceptive under the DTPA. The plaintiffs argue that Dell’s trade practice was material because it defendant. This confounds the injury-in-fact requirement for standing—which is satisfied by Ricci’s $16.31 injury—and the substantial injury prong of the DTPA analysis, and effectively eliminates the possibility of a class action under the DTPA surviving summary judgment prior to certification. 18', 'The Superior Court justice applied this standard, and neither party on appeal suggests that another standard should apply.', '- 21 - affected how much Ricci would have to pay. Dell argues that charging the tax was not likely to mislead consumers, and it was not material.', 'We agree with the Superior Court justice that Dell’s charge of the sales tax was a representation likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances. Dell represented that there was a sales tax on the service contract. That representation misled Ricci to pay the sales tax, when none was in fact due.', 'Regarding the third element, a representation is material if it “involves information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product.” F.T.C. v. Patriot Alcohol Testers, Inc., 798 F. Supp. 851, 855 (D. Mass. 1992) (quoting Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. at 165). Importantly for this case, “[e]xpress representations that are shown to be false are presumptively material.” Id. (citing Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. at 168, 182). Here, Dell made the express representation that sales tax was due on the service contract portion of Ricci’s purchase. But that representation was false. Therefore, Dell’s representation presumptively is material.', 'Dell points out that Ricci testified in her deposition that she was most concerned with the bottom-line price rather than the amount of the sales tax. And if she had properly been charged, i.e., charged no tax, the price would have been lower, thus making her more likely to buy the product.', 'Nevertheless, on summary judgment, these factors are insufficient to rebut the presumption of a material misrepresentation. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the proper amount of sales tax is “information that is important to consumers,” and defendants’ trade practice affected plaintiffs’ conduct regarding the product—the total price paid for it. See Patriot Alcohol Testers, Inc., 798 F. Supp. at 855 (quoting Cliffdale Associates, Inc.,', '- 22 - 103 F.T.C. at 165). Accordingly, a factfinder could conclude that the practice was deceptive under the DTPA.', 'Because a factfinder could conclude that Dell’s practice of charging sales tax on service contracts was unfair or deceptive under the DTPA, we vacate the grant of summary judgment on count 1 of the complaint.', 'Requests for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief', 'In Long, 984 A.2d at 1078, we noted that “plaintiffs conceded that Mr. Long could not bring a DTPA claim because his purchase was made for a business purpose.”', 'We also acknowledged that the Superior Court justice dismissed Long’s claims to “the extent he sought damages arising from Dell’s alleged negligence,” but that “[i]t is possible that Mr. Long may have a claim for equitable or declaratory relief—an issue that is not before us.” Id. at 1078 n.8. In the case at bar, the Superior Court justice addressed the issue of equitable relief on summary judgment, and he found that “[p]laintiffs’ prayer that the Court enjoin [d]efendants from collecting the allegedly improper taxes is moot, as Dell no longer collects [such taxes].”', 'The plaintiffs here allege only two counts—DTPA and negligence. Long’s concession that he has no DTPA claim because he purchased his computer for business purposes, Long, 984 A.2d at 1078, and our conclusion herein that summary judgment properly was granted on the negligence count, signal the end to Long’s case because neither cause of action remains.', 'An injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action.

Because Long has no underlying cause of action remaining, he has no right to seek the remedy of injunctive relief. Furthermore, the request for declaratory relief in the complaint requested a declaration that Dell’s practices were unfair or deceptive under the DTPA, were unlawful under the DTPA, and were breaches of Dell’s duty to properly calculate and collect sales tax. Because that request for declaratory relief relates solely to underlying rights or causes of action unavailable to Long, he may not pursue a declaratory judgment.', 'Accordingly, the Superior Court justice properly dismissed Long’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.', 'Ricci, however, may be entitled to seek declaratory or injunctive relief because, as discussed above, her DTPA claim survives, and “[t]he DTPA provides a private right of action to recover * * * equitable relief for violations of its provisions.” Long, 984 A.2d at 1080-81 (quoting Chavers, 844 A.2d at 670).', 'II', 'Motion to Strike', 'In a separate appeal, the tax administrator challenges the Superior Court justice’s grant of a motion to strike the tax administrator’s affirmative defenses. The Superior Court justice struck the defenses as immaterial under Rule 12(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because no claims had been asserted against the tax administrator, and because the conditions precedent to the allegedly conditional defenses had not arisen in this case.

This case is about allegedly unfair or deceptive trade practices brought against Dell under the DTPA. While tax issues are implicated by the nature of plaintiffs’ DTPA claim, no party has filed a claim against the tax administrator in this case. Although some defendants have filed “protective” claims for refunds with the tax administrator, those claims are, or may become, separate cases with different standards and can be reviewed under the appropriate procedures when (or if) a decision in the case before us is made adverse to Dell.

Thus, although the tax administrator may still appear and be heard on the proper interpretation, construction, and application of tax regulations and statutes, to the extent that these issues become germane, he may not defend against claims that are illusory in the context of this case. The maintenance of these affirmative defenses only', '- 26 - distracts the parties from the real remaining issue in this case—whether Dell’s practice of collecting sales tax on service contracts was an unfair or deceptive trade practice.', 'We pause to note that the tax administrator cannot be collaterally estopped from raising any defenses that he was precluded from asserting in this case. The resolution of the tax refund claims is a separate matter. If a party files a claim against the tax administrator in this case, obviously, he may file an answer and assert affirmative defenses appropriate for the claims asserted. But unless and until that time comes, the tax administrator’s affirmative defenses are immaterial. See Super. R. Civ. P. 12(f).

It defies logic even further to contend that Dell’s actions were “tyrannical” or done with “no regard for what is right or honorable.” It is clear to me beyond a peradventure that Dell was attempting to charge the appropriate tax in order to do what was right, honorable, ethical, and moral—namely, to pay the state of Rhode Island what it believed to be the appropriate amount of sales tax.', 'The majority opinion states that, while Dell can argue that it was operating under a “good faith interpretation of tax law,” a jury could also infer that “Dell’s efforts to avoid its own tax nexus with Rhode Island unfairly resulted in consumers being charged for taxes that they should not have been charged.” Contrary to the stance adopted by my colleagues in the majority, I am completely unable to perceive any evidence presented by Ms. Ricci suggesting that Dell’s actions were anything other than a “good faith interpretation of tax law.” It is a settled legal principle that the party against whom a motion for summary judgment has been filed “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v.

As was helpful in determining the issue of unfairness, a dictionary definition of “material” provides helpful contextual guidance in the present circumstance; and I note that “material” is defined as “[b]eing both relevant and consequential; crucial.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1083 (5th ed. 2011).', 'Under that definition, even accepting the majority’s statement that false representations are “‘presumptively material,’” the dearth of evidence tending to show that 3', 'I recognize that, for the purposes of analyzing a claim under the DTPA, one is not necessarily required to prove every factor of the articulated standard. Indeed, the majority opinion expressly acknowledges that point: “The plaintiffs need not establish every factor, and they may prove unfairness by showing that a trade practice meets one factor to a great degree or two or three factors to a lesser degree. See Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. v. Montes, 612 A.2d 1130, 1143-44 (Conn. 1992) * * * .” However, in my opinion, Dell’s actions which form the basis of the DTPA claim at issue in the instant case are so obviously not immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous that I consider that conclusion sufficient to establish that summary judgment in favor of Dell was appropriate.', '- 32 - Dell’s actions were “relevant and consequential” because they affected a consumer’s choice with respect to the product overcomes any such presumption. Ms. Ricci testified that she was concerned only with the full price of the computer and the service contract which she was purchasing—and not with the amount of tax being applied to her purchase. Therefore, Dell’s act of charging an amount in taxes that was minimally excessive did not change Ms. Ricci’s decision to purchase the computer. See Patriot Alcohol Testers, Inc., 798 F. Supp. at 855. As reflected in Ms. Ricci’s own admission, she was not concerned with the amount of tax being charged. Ironically, had Dell charged the appropriate amount of tax, the overall price of Ms. Ricci’s computer would have been lower, not higher, thus giving her a further incentive to purchase the computer. Therefore, contrary to the majority, I can perceive absolutely no evidence on which a reasonable jury could find Dell’s actions to be deceptive.', 'In conclusion, based on our settled law with respect to summary judgment and the application of the plain meaning of English words, it is my opinion that the hearing justice acted appropriately when he determined, in ruling on Dell’s motion for summary judgment, that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that Dell was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Correctional Medical Services, Inc., 645 F.3d 484, 503 (1st Cir. 2011) (stating that “[b]ased on [the previously described] series of events, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that [an employee of the defendant corporation] acted with deliberate indifference” and, consequently, affirming a grant of summary judgment in that employee’s favor); Estate of Frusher v.

Supp. 2d 220, 227 (D.R.I. 2009) (determining that, based on the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could not conclude that the decedent had an “unsound mind” and, that, therefore, summary judgment was appropriate); Empire Acquisition Group, LLC v.

The majority opinion states that, for the purposes of summary judgment, it will treat the class in the instant case as if it had already been certified—which it has not been. (I explicitly decline to take a position as to the correctness vel non of that very broad interpretation of what Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure permits.) As a consequence of that rather ipse dixit “as if” assumption, when the majority considers whether or not Ms. Ricci suffered a “substantial injury” for the purpose of determining whether Dell’s actions were “unfair,” it aggregates the damages suffered by the entire class; it states as follows:', '“If the only injury to be considered in the light most favorable to', 'plaintiff was [Ms. Ricci’s injury of] $16.31, we may well agree', 'with the Superior Court justice. However, because we treat the', 'class as certified for purposes of drawing reasonable inferences in', 'favor of the nonmoving party, and viewing evidence in the most', 'favorable light, we will consider the evidence in the record of', 'potential injury to the class.”', 'In my view, the majority’s statement aggregating the damages of the entire class is completely inconsistent with established law with respect to class actions. One treatise summarizes as follows the state of American law in this regard:', '“Named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and', 'show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has', 'been suffered by other members of the class that they purportedly', 'represent. If a named plaintiff has not been injured by the wrong', 'alleged in the complaint, then no case or controversy is presented,', 'and the plaintiff has no standing to sue either on his or her own', 'behalf or on behalf of a class.

Resolution GGF Oy, 136 F.3d 1130 (7th Cir. 1998); and Evans v. Taco Bell Corp., CIV. 04CV103JD, 2005 WL 2333841 (D.N.H.

Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 7:10 at 50 (2013); cf. 6A Federal Procedure, § 12:284 at 396 (Lawyers Ed. 2004) (stating that the failure by a district court to address the class action issue on a Fed.

P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss “does limit the scope of the court of appeals’ judgment in that, because no class of plaintiff or defendants is certified, * * * the plaintiffs’ claims must be treated as being brought solely by the named plaintiffs against the named defendants”). The statement in the Advisory Committee Notes clearly contemplates that, when a motion for summary judgment is brought prior to the certification of the class, the motion for summary judgment is, with respect to the individual claims of the named plaintiffs, not those of the entire class. I further note that, in arguing to the contrary, the majority opinion cites to only one legal source in the paragraph that it devotes to the issue of “substantial injury;” that source does not discuss and is not relevant to the issue of “substantial injury.” In fact, the majority opinion does not cite to any direct source anywhere in support of its apparent conclusion that, if a class were to be treated as having been certified for the purposes of summary judgment, the damages could then be aggregated.', 'Moreover, the majority’s holding muddies the waters with respect to who is bound by a Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in a defendant’s favor prior to a ruling on class certification. See 6A Federal Procedure, § 12:276 at 377 (stating the typical rule that, if a motion for summary judgment is “granted before a class is certified, the ruling binds only the individual parties”); see also id. § 12:404 at 561 (“A summary judgment entered in favor of the party opposing a class will not bind absent class members * * * prior to a class action determination. However, if a summary judgment is granted to the party opposing the class after the class has been certified * * * the judgment will have classwide res judicata effect on all those class members who do not opt out of the class upon being provided with notice.”).', 'For the foregoing reasons, it is my opinion that, in accordance with the law on class actions and irrespective of the majority’s having, for the purposes of summary judgment, treated the class as having been certified, the named plaintiff representing the class must individually meet the requirements for stating a claim under the DTPA, including (as one factor) whether he or she sustained a “substantial injury.”', 'In order to make clear my exact line of reasoning, I reiterate that I explicitly decline to opine on the propriety of the majority’s decision to treat the plaintiff class as if it had been certified. For that reason, I need not contend with Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666 (R.I. 2004), which is cited by the majority. The opinion in Chavers is used by the majority only to support its decision to treat the plaintiff class as having been certified; Chavers does not support, and indeed could not support, the portion of the majority opinion with which I take issue; my point, succinctly stated, is that the majority errs in aggregating the damages of the potential plaintiff class, regardless of whether or not the majority treats the plaintiff class as having been certified.', '- 35 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Nicholas T.

8,(05-1833-2) In re Steven D. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on May 6, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. In these consolidated appeals, the respondents, Kathleen D. and Ronald D.1 (collectively, respondents) appeal from a Family Court decree terminating their parental rights to their two children, Steven D. and Zachary D., for a second time. After a careful review of the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that these appeals may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court. 1', 'For the sake of clarity and privacy, the family members will be referred to by only their first names; in so doing, we intend no disrespect.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'These consolidated appeals require us to revisit the sad facts of a case with which this Court is well acquainted.2 In July 2005, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) filed neglect petitions against Ronald and Kathleen, seeking custody of their two sons: Steven, who was born on September 22, 1997, and Zachary, who was born on November 1, 2000.3 In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1140, 1141 (R.I. 2011). The boys initially were removed from the home when Kathleen was hospitalized and Ronald was unable to care for the children due to his own medical issues. Id. at 1141. Subsequently, the parents admitted to dependency, and the boys were committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF until further order of the Family Court. Id. at 1142. The boys were later allowed to remain in the home, on the condition that Ronald and Kathleen cooperate with case plans developed for the family, which included that the parents “refrain from using any illegal or intoxicating substances, including alcohol.” Id. at 1141. They failed.', 'In April 2006—eight years ago—the Family Court granted DCYF’s motion to remove Steven and Zachary from their parents’ home. In re Steven D., 23 A.3d at 1143. On September 14, 2007—in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3)4—DCYF filed petitions to terminate 2', 'The facts of this case were previously detailed in our opinion, In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138 (R.I. 2011), to which we refer. Due to the lengthy travel and the voluminous record of this case, we will discuss only the facts and travel pertinent to the current appeals. 3', 'In 1996—before Steven and Zachary were born, and while residing in Florida—Kathleen and Ronald had their parental rights terminated to three other children based on allegations of domestic violence and chronic substance abuse. 4', 'Entitled “Termination of parental rights,” G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3) provides in pertinent part:', '“(a) The court shall, upon a petition duly filed by a governmental child', 'placement agency or licensed child placement agency after notice to the parent', 'and a hearing on the petition, terminate any and all legal rights of the parent to the', '-2- Kathleen and Ronald’s parental rights to the boys. Id. at 1146. A trial on these petitions culminated in a decree of the Family Court, terminating the respondents’ parental rights. Id. at 1153. The decree subsequently was appealed to this Court. A majority of the members of this Court vacated the decree after concluding that (1) DCYF had not made reasonable efforts to reunify Kathleen and the children; (2) the determination that Ronald was an unfit parent was not proven by clear and convincing evidence; and (3) the admission of Kathleen’s substance abuse test results into evidence at trial, without a foundation being laid, was in error. Id. at 1161, 1163, 1165.', 'After this Court issued its opinion on June 29, 2011, new case plans were developed for Ronald and Kathleen. Nothing changed; the parents made no progress and continued their alcoholic lifestyle. On November 28, 2012, DCYF filed new petitions, again requesting that the Family Court terminate both parents’ rights to Steven and Zachary. A second trial, spanning ten days, commenced on March 27, 2013, and produced over 1,300 pages of trial transcripts and culminated in a 129-page written decision issued by a second Family Court justice on June 26, 2013, thereby terminating, for a second time, Kathleen and Ronald’s parental rights to Steven and Zachary.', 'In his written decision, the Family Court justice provided a thorough review of all the', 'child, including the right to notice of any subsequent adoption proceedings', 'involving the child, if the court finds as a fact by clear and convincing evidence', 'that:', '“* * *', '“(3) The child has been placed in the legal custody or care of the', 'department for children, youth, and families for at least twelve (12) months, and', 'the parents were offered or received services to correct the situation which led to', 'the child being placed; provided, that there is not a substantial probability that the', 'child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period', 'of time considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent home * * *.”', '-3- testimony and exhibits introduced at trial, and made eighty separate findings of fact regarding Ronald’s parental unfitness. Specifically, he noted that, after a substance abuse evaluation was performed, Ronald was provided with a substance abuse treatment plan and services to effectuate that plan. However, the trial justice cataloged Ronald’s failure to achieve sobriety despite the numerous referrals for treatment at various service providers. The trial justice found that Ronald consistently denied that he had a problem with alcohol, denied that he needed help, and refused to acknowledge that his behavioral choices impacted the children. In support of this finding, the trial justice itemized sixteen instances where Ronald had tested positive for alcohol on either a urine or breathalyzer screen, and another eleven instances where Ronald had failed to appear for court-ordered alcohol screens.', 'The Family Court justice accepted the conclusion of the caseworker assigned to Ronald, “that the parents made a decision not to change their lifestyle with respect to drinking,” despite the caseworker’s insistence that failure to change would present a barrier to reunification with the children. The trial justice determined that “[t]he totality of the evidence clearly establishes that [Ronald] did, in fact, suffer from an alcohol problem for which treatment was provided by DCYF through substance abuse providers.” He noted that “[t]he evidence clearly establishes that [Ronald] did not fully comply with the services provided, nor with the goals set forth in the case plans with respect to his alcohol problems,” and concluded that Ronald “has failed and refused to comply with the various recommendations made by the service providers with respect to his refusal to acknowledge an alcohol problem and to cease taking alcohol during this entire period since the children were in DCYF custody.”', 'The Family Court justice also made forty separate findings of fact specifically concerning Kathleen’s unfitness as a parent. He found that a case plan had been developed by DCYF for', '-4- Kathleen which was similar to the one established for Ronald, and that Kathleen was also advised as to what was expected in order for her to be reunited with the children. She did not comply. Kathleen was discharged from treatment at the Providence Center—where she was receiving assistance with substance abuse, anger management, and mental health issues—after thirteen months because of her lack of progress and her failure to cooperate. The Family Court justice noted that Kathleen had told her caseworker that “the only time she didn’t drink was because DCYF was making her not drink,” and that she would continue to consume alcohol once she was reunited with the children. Kathleen continued to have positive urine screens for alcohol, refused to submit to some alcohol screens, and appeared at counseling sessions while visibly intoxicated.5 Although DCYF referred Kathleen to additional providers for substance abuse and mental health counseling, the Family Court justice determined that she had made no progress with substance abuse treatment as a result of her refusal to admit that her alcohol consumption was problematic or that her behavioral choices impacted the children.', 'With respect to reasonable efforts, there were many; however, the record reflects that both parents chose alcohol over their children. The Family Court justice found that DCYF had referred Kathleen and Ronald to various facilities for substance abuse evaluations and counseling, as well as to additional facilities which provide family counseling services. The Family Court justice noted that taxicab services were provided to Kathleen and Ronald to transport them to and from each service provider, and to and from planned visits with the children, and that this transportation, as well as the services provided at the facilities, was paid for by the taxpayers. He determined that “[t]he clear and convincing evidence establishes that DCYF took all proper action in making referrals for the benefit of each parent,” which, he noted 5', 'After admitting at trial that testing conducted weeks earlier showed a .30 blood-alcohol level, Kathleen claimed she had “no idea why it was that high.”', '-5- was primarily to address the issue of the parents’ alcohol abuse. Nonetheless, he concluded that “the parents refused to comply with the requirements of the case plans and continued to drink alcohol beverages, notwithstanding the implications explained to them with respect to the reunification process.”', 'As a result, the Family Court justice declared that “[a]ny lack of reunification falls squarely at the feet of these recalcitrant parents.”', 'Finally, the Family Court justice addressed the best interests of the children. He first found that—because Steven and Zachary had last been removed from their parents’ home by DCYF on April 26, 2006—the children had not only been in DCYF custody for well over twelve consecutive months, but in fact, for more than half of their lifetimes. The trial justice found that the boys had been living in their pre-adoptive home for over two years, and “were attached to the pre-adoptive family and their needs were being met by them.” He noted that “[t]he children are happy and bonded with their foster parents who wish to adopt them and they wish to be adopted by them.” The trial justice found that the boys “repeatedly told their counselor, Ms. Brackley, that they did not want to return to live with their biological parents and wanted to be adopted by the family that they were, in fact, living with,” the pre-adoptive parents. The trial justice also found that the boys were afraid to tell Ronald and Kathleen that they wanted to be adopted. He accepted the conclusion of the boys’ social worker, who had determined that, based upon a reasonable degree of clinical certainty, “the best interests of the children were to live with and be adopted by the family they were living with now so that they may grow.”', 'In conclusion, the Family Court justice declared that, in accordance with § 15-7-7(3), “the children have been placed in the legal custody of [DCYF] for at least twelve months,” and that Ronald and Kathleen “were offered or received services to correct the situation which led to the children being placed,” but that there was “not a substantial probability that the children will', '-6- be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of time considering the children’s age and the need for a permanent home.” Moreover, he determined that, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii),6 Ronald and Kathleen were “unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the children,” namely that “the parents have a chronic substance abuse problem and that all of the credible testimony and documentary evidence clearly indicates * * * that the children will not be able to return to the custody of the parents within a reasonable period of time.” The decision concluded by terminating Kathleen and Ronald’s parental rights to Steven and Zachary, and a decree reflecting this termination was entered on July 8, 2013.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court is cognizant that “[n]atural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the ‘care, custody, and management’ of their children.” In re Destiny D., 922 A.2d 168, 172 (R.I. 6', 'Section 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii) states, in pertinent part:', '“(a) The court shall, upon a petition duly filed by a governmental child', 'placement agency or licensed child placement agency after notice to the parent', 'and a hearing on the petition, terminate any and all legal rights of the parent to the', 'child, including the right to notice of any subsequent adoption proceedings', 'involving the child, if the court finds as a fact by clear and convincing evidence', 'that:', '“* * *', '“(2) The parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously', 'detrimental to the child; such as, but not limited to, the following:', '“* * *', '“(iii) The child has been placed in the legal custody or care of the', 'department for children, youth, and families and the parent has a chronic', 'substance abuse problem and the parent’s prognosis indicates that the child will', 'not be able to return to the custody of the parent within a reasonable period of', 'time, considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent home.

Conducting this review requires us to engage in a three-step process in which we (1) review the trial justice’s finding of parental unfitness; (2) consider whether reasonable efforts at reunification were made by DCYF; and (3) evaluate the finding that termination of parental rights is, in fact, in the best interest of the child. In re Pricillion R., 971 A.2d 599, 604 (R.I. 2009) (citing In re Brooklyn M., 933 A.2d 1113, 1122 (R.I. 2007)). In so doing, we are mindful that the Family Court justice’s findings in a termination proceeding “are accorded great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that they are clearly wrong or the [Family Court] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” In re Lauren B., 78 A.3d at 759 (quoting In re Charles L., 6 A.3d 1089, 1093 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, each parent filed a separate appeal and corresponding memoranda. First, Ronald argues that the Family Court justice erred in finding that (1) he was an unfit parent; (2) that DCYF made reasonable efforts to correct the situation that led to the children’s placement outside of the home; and (3) that the termination of his parental rights was in the best interests of the children. We reject these contentions.', 'In accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii), a court may terminate parental rights upon finding,', '-8- by clear and convincing evidence, that:', '“The parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously', 'detrimental to the child; such as, but not limited to * * * [that] [t]he', 'child has been placed in the legal custody or care of [DCYF] and', 'the parent has a chronic substance abuse problem and the parent’s', 'prognosis indicates that the child will not be able to return to the', 'custody of the parent within a reasonable period of time,', 'considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent home.', 'The fact that a parent has been unable to provide care for a child', 'for a period of twelve (12) months due to substance abuse shall', 'constitute prima facie evidence of a chronic substance abuse', 'problem * * *.” Alternatively, parental rights may also be terminated pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(3), upon a finding that the child has been in DCYF custody for at least twelve months, that the parent has been offered or received services to correct the situation, and that “there is not a substantial probability that the child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent home[.]”', 'Notably, a court’s termination of parental rights may be based on the grounds enumerated in either provision. See In re Lyric P., 90 A.3d 132, 140 (R.I. 2014) (“A termination of rights may be supported on either ground, that [the] respondent was unfit or that the child was unlikely to be able to return to [the] respondent’s care within a reasonable period.”).', 'In the case at bar, we are satisfied that the Family Court justice made sufficient findings of unfitness—in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii)—to stand independently, and we also hold that sufficient findings were made to support the termination of Ronald’s parental rights on either ground. Concerning the finding that Ronald was an unfit parent, the Family Court justice noted that Ronald had undergone a clinical evaluation which concluded that he had a substance abuse problem and that treatment was necessary. The trial justice then detailed the plethora of services provided to Ronald to remedy this situation, but found that these services were ineffective solely due to Ronald’s own recalcitrance. After noting that the children had been in foster care for', '-9- more than half of their lives and that Ronald refused to achieve sobriety, the trial justice concluded that Ronald’s prognosis indicated that Steven and Zachary would not be able to return to the home within a reasonable time. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in reaching this conclusion and therefore refuse to disturb this finding.', 'We also disagree with Ronald’s contention that the trial justice erred by finding that DCYF had made reasonable efforts at reunification. The record reflects that the failure in this case was Ronald’s, and not that of DCYF. When reviewing whether or not DCYF has made reasonable efforts at reunification, “we employ a ‘totality of the circumstances approach,’ pursuant to which ‘the efforts required from DCYF to satisfy the reasonable efforts standard vary with the differing capacities of the parents involved.’” In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d 655, 666 (R.I. 2012) (quoting In re Kayla N., 900 A.2d 1202, 1209 (R.I. 2006)). Thus, “[t]he criterion of ‘reasonable efforts’ is ‘subject to a case-by-case analysis [that takes] into account, among other things, the conduct and cooperation of the parents.’” Id. (quoting In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d 612, 618 (R.I. 1997)).', 'Furthermore, reasonable efforts must be made by DCYF, “regardless of the unlikelihood of their success.” In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198, 203 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re Manuel P., 889 A.2d 192, 198 (R.I. 2006)). As such, “[w]e have recognized that reunification may not always be possible even when DCYF has made the requisite ‘reasonable efforts.’” In re Lauren B., 78 A.3d at 760 (quoting In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d at 666). Therefore, “we do not fault [DCYF] when the treatment received does not resolve the underlying problem or when a parent’s recalcitrance to treatment precludes reunification.” Id. (quoting In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d at 666); see also In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 882 (R.I. 2009) (noting that DCYF “need not undertake extraordinary efforts to reunite parent and child”) (quoting In re Diamond Y., 915', '- 10 - A.2d 1283, 1288 (R.I. 2007)).', 'In this case, the trial justice detailed how DCYF not only referred Ronald and Kathleen to various facilities for substance abuse evaluation and treatment, parent and child evaluations, and mental health counseling, but also provided them with transportation to and from the appointments. Our review of the record reveals that despite Ronald’s consistent denials that he has a substance abuse problem or that he was in need of services, DCYF met its obligation by offering ample services to address his chronic drinking. Thus, we are confronted with yet another case where DCYF’s efforts—undertaken over a course of seven years—“were consistently undermined, however, by the parents’ reticence, their seemingly blind support of each other, and their collective allegiance to utter denial.” In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d at 618-19 (citing In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 204 (R.I. 1989) (explaining that termination was proper when the parents consistently denied existence of abuse and were unwilling to work toward reunification)). Nonetheless, “[w]hen the welfare of a child is concerned, [DCYF] and the [Family] [C]ourt have the duty to request compliance with services offered and the completion of programs to be certain that respondents have, in fact, addressed their problems.” In re Michael F., 665 A.2d 880, 882 (R.I. 1995). Thus, it is clear to this Court that, despite the fact that DCYF provided each parent with the services necessary for reunification, both Ronald and Kathleen either failed or refused to comply with each and every case plan and squandered a second opportunity to meaningfully engage in the services provided.', 'We now turn to Ronald’s final contention that the trial justice erred in finding that the termination of his parental rights were in the best interests of the children. It is well settled that, after a trial justice makes a determination of parental unfitness, “the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” In re Destiny D., 922 A.2d at 173 (quoting In re Kristen B.,', '- 11 - 558 A.2d at 203). Accordingly, a trial justice’s determination of the best interests of a child includes “the right of a minor child to reasonable care and maintenance, freedom from abuse or neglect, and the right to be given an opportunity to spend the remainder of his or her childhood in a family setting in which the child may grow and thrive.” In re Christopher B., 823 A.2d 301, 317 (R.I. 2003) (quoting In re Stephanie, 456 A.2d 268, 271 (R.I. 1983)).', 'We are satisfied that the Family Court justice appropriately considered the relevant factors before coming to the conclusion that the children’s best interests would be served by remaining in the care of their pre-adoptive family. The trial justice indicated that Steven and Zachary had spent more than half their lives outside of the custody of their biological parents. He detailed the boys’ frustration—as testified to by their counselor, Ms. Brackley—at the lack of permanency of their placement, as well as the fact that their scheduled visits with Ronald and Kathleen repeatedly were canceled due to medical issues or because the parents were drunk when they arrived for the visits. He noted that Zachary had been diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, and that both children had been diagnosed with ADHD and post-traumatic stress disorder. He also gave credence to the children’s concern that “they would be returned to an atmosphere that was counter-productive to their growth, particularly with respect to the mother’s attitude and actions with respect to drinking, yelling and screaming.”7', 'In contrast, the Family Court justice found that Steven and Zachary “were quite well adjusted in their foster home,” and were happy and bonded with their foster parents, and that the boys’ needs were being met by the foster parents. The trial justice also deemed it prudent to consider Steven’s interest in remaining with his current placement, given his age and need for 7', 'The trial justice specifically accepted Steven’s concerns that, if he were to be returned to his parents, Kathleen and Ronald would “go back to doing what they were doing to get us taken away. We’d just get taken away again like before. * * * My mom would go back to drinking, and I would have to take care of Zachary.”', '- 12 - permanency. Finally, the trial justice accepted the expert testimony of Ms. Brackley, who opined that, based upon a reasonable degree of clinical certainty, “the boys would be best served by remaining in the safe and nurturing environment of the pre-adoptive family.” After careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s findings are not clearly wrong and that he did not overlook or misconceive material evidence. We refuse to disturb the Family Court justice’s conclusion that termination of Ronald’s parental rights was in the best interests of the children.', 'Lastly, Kathleen raises a single issue before this Court—namely, that the Family Court justice erred in arriving at his findings, as set forth in the decision, because DCYF did not include as part of its case plan any interaction between Kathleen and the children’s foster parents. Thus, Kathleen argues that DCYF’s “failure to incorporate interaction with the foster parents” should result in this Court’s vacating of the Family Court decree. We note that Kathleen has not cited any law in support of this contention. We deem this argument to be without merit.', 'Whether a petition to terminate rights is based on grounds enumerated in § 15-7- 7(a)(3)—that the child was unlikely to return to the parent’s care within a reasonable period—or § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii)—that a parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the child, such as chronic substance abuse—reasonable efforts toward reunification must be made by DCYF before parental rights may be terminated. This Court previously has held that “[r]easonable efforts toward reunification must be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence and may be substantiated by attempts to provide the family with services, case plans, visitation, and furnishing the parent with information of the child’s well being.” In re Isabella C., 852 A.2d 550, 559 (R.I. 2004) (citing In re John W., 682 A.2d 930, 932 (R.I. 1996)). The', '- 13 - stated purpose for such efforts, however, is to “encourage and strengthen the parental relationship so that the child can safely return to the family.” Section 15-7-7(b)(1).', 'Accordingly, DCYF’s efforts are aimed at accomplishing reunification, so that termination proceedings may be circumvented, and are solely for the benefit of the parent and child. As such, we see no basis in law for Kathleen’s contention that DCYF is required to provide interaction between a biological parent and a foster parent. 8 The placement of neglected or abused children in foster homes is designed to protect and nurture the children during this difficult period in their young lives.', 'Foster parents have no role in DCYF’s efforts at reunification.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in finding, by clear and convincing evidence, competent proof to support the termination of Ronald and Kathleen’s parental rights in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(3) and § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii). It is clear to this Court that, after having been provided with a second chance at parenting, the parents have forfeited yet another opportunity to achieve sobriety and reunification with their children. Nonetheless, “[c]hildren ‘are entitled to permanency; they should not have to wait for an indeterminate period of time to find out if their parents will successfully obtain and maintain a substance free lifestyle.’” In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d at 454 (quoting In re Shawn M., 898 A.2d 102, 108 (R.I. 2006)).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we deny and dismiss the respondents’ appeals and affirm the decree of the Family Court terminating the respondents’ parental rights to Steven and Zachary. The papers in this case may be returned to the Family Court. 8', 'The record discloses that Kathleen was given—and vehemently refused—the option of having an open adoption with Steven and Zachary’s foster parents. As a result, the termination of respondents’ parental rights to Steven and Zachary also includes termination of “the right to notice of any subsequent adoption proceedings involving the child[ren].” Section 15-7-7(a).', '- 14 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'In re Steven D. et al.

9,State : v. : Darnell Hie.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Darnell Hie, appeals to this Court from a November 17, 2011 judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of two counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in refusing to declare a mistrial and in denying his motion for a new trial. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction and its denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The complaining witness, Jessica,1 was born on November 12, 1994 and was seventeen years old at the time of trial, in November of 2011. According to her testimony, on November 2, 2009, at the age fourteen, Jessica disclosed to her cousin Sarah (who was also her classmate) that defendant, Jessica’s stepfather, had sexually molested her multiple times when she was in the third grade. It was Jessica’s testimony that, immediately after listening to that disclosure, Sarah encouraged Jessica to share this information with Yvonne, Jessica’s mother; Jessica added that she agreed and used her cellular phone to send a text message to her mother, asking her to come to her school because she needed to talk to her. Jessica stated that Yvonne arrived at the school, and there, in the principal’s office, she revealed to her mother that defendant had sexually molested her.', 'On May 21, 2010, a Providence County grand jury indicted defendant on four counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.1 and ten counts of second- degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3. The charged offenses were alleged to have occurred between September of 2002 and June of 2003.

In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '-2-', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'Jessica testified that, at the time of the assaults, she lived in an apartment on Charles Street in Providence with her mother, her older sister, Adriana, her less than one-year-old half- sister, Daria, and defendant, whom she had known, “[her] whole life.” She stated that she shared a bedroom with her sisters and that her mother and defendant slept in another bedroom. At trial, Jessica described five separate incidents that she testified took place over a ten-to-twelve week period, during which defendant came into her room during the night, assaulted her, and left.', 'Jessica testified that during the first incident (Counts One & Two), defendant “came into [her] room and he laid under the covers with [her] and touched [her] under and over [her] pajamas.” She stated that she was awake during this incident, but that she kept her eyes closed because “[she] was scared.” She further stated that she assumed defendant was the one who touched her because “[she] felt his hands touching [her] body” and “[h]is hands were rough.”', 'Jessica testified that the second incident (Counts Three, Four & Five) took place approximately two weeks later. She stated that she was sleeping in her bed, lying on her stomach, and awoke to the touch of defendant’s hands on her breast and vagina “over and under [her] pajamas.” She stated that she opened her eyes this time and, “[t]hrough the corner of [her] eye,” saw defendant on top of her. She testified: “At first he was touching me and then he inserted his penis in my rear end.”', 'It was Jessica’s testimony that the third incident (Counts Six, Seven & Eight) took place approximately two weeks after the second incident. She stated that she was sleeping in her bed, this time on her back, and awoke to the touch of defendant’s hands on her breast and vagina', '-3- “over and under [her] pajamas.” She stated that she opened her eyes and saw defendant on top of her. This time, she further stated, “[defendant] actually inserted his penis inside my vagina.”', 'The fourth incident (Counts Nine, Ten & Eleven), Jessica testified, was similar to the second incident. She stated that she was sleeping in her bed, lying on her stomach, and awoke to the touch of defendant’s “rough” hands on her breast and vagina “over and under [her] pajamas.” She further stated that, when she opened her eyes, defendant was “on top of [her] with his hands underneath [her] from behind.” Then, Jessica stated, defendant penetrated her anally.', 'During the fifth incident (Counts Twelve, Thirteen & Fourteen) concerning which Jessica testified, she was sleeping in her bed, on her back, and awoke to the touch of defendant’s hands on her breast and vagina “over and under [her] pajamas.” Then, she stated, defendant “insert[ed] his penis inside my vagina.”', 'Jessica testified that she did not tell anyone about the incidents when they occurred because “[defendant] was still in the house” and “[she] didn’t feel safe.” On cross-examination, Jessica testified that defendant did not threaten her and never said anything to her during the incidents that she had described. She had testified on direct examination, however, that “[w]hen [she] would see [defendant] around the house,” “[h]e would give like little side smiles here and there.”', 'In her testimony, Jessica estimated that each incident lasted “[a]bout 20 to 30 minutes.” She stated that each of the incidents occurred while her sisters, Adriana and Daria, were sleeping in the same room. She further stated that she did not “call[] out” to Adriana or to her mother and never told defendant to “stop” or “get away.” When Jessica was asked by defense counsel whether she had any type of discharge or blood after the second or third incident, she replied “[n]ot that I know of.”', '-4-', 'Jessica acknowledged in her testimony that six to seven years had passed between defendant’s assaults and her reporting about them. During this time, she stated, her mother and defendant “had an okay relationship” but “[t]hey had their ups and downs.” She further stated that, although her mother and defendant “broke up and [defendant] left the house for good” in 2007, her mother and defendant continued to see each other. Jessica testified that only when she knew defendant “was gone for good,” after her mother filed for divorce, did she feel “safe enough to talk about it.”', 'Jessica testified that, after she revealed to her mother (at the office of the principal of her school) that defendant had “raped” her, she refused to describe the assaults in any detail to her. Jessica stated that she did not want to tell her mother about the details because she “was scared and because [her mother] has kids with [defendant]” and “[b]ecause [she] knew it would hurt her [mother] more.”', '2.', 'The Testimony of the Mother of the Complaining Witness', 'Jessica’s mother, Yvonne, testified that she had known defendant since 1994, when she was twenty-four years old; she added that she married him in 1999. Yvonne further testified that, at the time of the assaults, she lived with defendant in an apartment on Charles Street in Providence along with her daughters—Adriana, Jessica, and Daria. Yvonne stated that, since Daria was one month old, she “would * * * spend the night in [Adriana]’s bed a lot of the time.”', 'Yvonne testified that her daughter Adriana told her one morning that “she awoke in the middle of the night and saw [defendant] * * * in their bedroom * * * looking out the window.” Yvonne further testified that, when she asked defendant to explain what he had done in the girls’ room, “[h]e said he had heard something [and he] wanted to make sure the windows were locked.” Yvonne stated that she found defendant’s behavior “odd” and that it “kind of upset', '-5- [her] a little.” It was Yvonne’s testimony that, after that incident, she installed a lock on Adriana and Jessica’s door; she described the lock as being “one of those that you buy at any hardware store and screw it into the wall.” She stated that she wanted to put a lock on their door so that “they can lock their door and feel safe at night.” Yvonne further stated that she asked her daughters to lock their bedroom door at night.', 'It was Yvonne’s testimony that defendant “didn’t understand why there was a lock on the door” and “would say things like what if there was a fire, or what if something happens, how are we going to get to them.” Yvonne testified that, a week or two after she installed the lock, defendant “pushed the door in and broke the lock.” She summarized as follows defendant’s explanation as to why he broke the lock:', '“[He] stated that he heard some noise in their room. He thought', 'somebody was in their bedroom, and I had my ear to the door. I', 'didn’t hear anything. He kept insisting somebody was there. He', 'got mad and pushed the door, forced the door open, kind of broke', 'the piece of the wood so we couldn’t put the lock back on.” Yvonne stated that, when defendant came through the door, no one other than Adriana and Jessica was in the room; she added that they were in bed and that they “jumped up, scared.” It was further her testimony that there was never another adult male in the house overnight and that, during the time period in which the assaults occurred, Jessica “seemed nervous all the time.”', 'On cross-examination, Yvonne testified that the first time she heard that defendant was assaulting Jessica was in 2009, when Jessica told her at her school that defendant had “raped [her].” Yvonne added that Jessica never disclosed any further details of what happened to her and that, even at the time of trial, she still had “no idea of what actually happened other than that [Jessica] told [her] that she was raped by [defendant].” It was her testimony that she “explained', '-6- to [Jessica] what rape was” and Jessica confirmed that she had been raped, stating, “‘Yes, he raped me.’” Yvonne reiterated that her daughter had never spoken to her about any details.', 'On redirect examination, the prosecutor and Yvonne engaged in the following exchange:', '“[Prosecutor]: You have been asked a number of different', 'questions a number of different ways about the fact that your', 'daughter has not explained to you what she meant by rape; is that', 'right?', '“[Yvonne]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: She has never told her mother that someone put his', 'penis in her anus; is that right?', '“[Yvonne]: No.', '“[Prosecutor]: She has never told you that someone put his penis', 'in her vagina; is that right?” At that point, defense counsel objected, but Yvonne proceeded to answer in the negative. A sidebar conference, out of the hearing of the jury, then took place; defense counsel addressed the trial justice as follows: “[T]he witness is totally broken down on the stand. She is crying uncontrollably. It’s through no question that I asked her. It’s through the prosecutor’s redirect.” Defense counsel asked the trial justice to pass the case (i.e., declare a mistrial), arguing that the prosecutor “went after” Yvonne “as a total adverse witness against the rules of redirect;” he added that “[t]o have her breakdown [sic] to the point where the jury can feel nothing but sympathy, I think it’s prejudicial to my client.” The trial justice characterized the prosecutor’s questioning as a “very grave error,” “totally inappropriate,” and “totally improper.” He further chastised the prosecutor at sidebar as follows:', '“Why in the world did you take it upon yourself to tell her', 'what her own daughter has never told her after all of these years', 'when the witness’s answers have been consistent on both direct', 'and cross examination that the daughter never told her?', '-7-', '“***', '“This case rises and falls on the witness’s statement,', '[Jessica’s] statement, not what her mother didn’t know that, you,', 'with great vehemen[ce] told her that she didn’t know, and I think it', 'was very inappropriate that you took it upon yourself to tell her', 'what she didn’t know when it wasn’t necessary. It wasn’t', 'necessary to prove your case and put this woman through the', 'distress that she is now going through.” Despite his criticism at sidebar of the challenged questions by the prosecutor, the trial justice nonetheless decided not to pass the case; and he denied defense counsel’s motion to that effect. Instead, the trial justice provided a curative instruction to the jury as follows:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, that line of questioning engaged in', 'by the prosecutor I consider to be inappropriate to this witness.', 'First of all, the witness answered consistently in both direct, cross', 'and redirect that she was never told by her daughter what the actual', 'alleged acts of misconduct were.', '“I think it’s unfortunate that the prosecution chose to reveal', 'these facts to this woman at this time. It really doesn’t add', 'anything to this case other than to the discomfort of this woman.', '“Now, one of the dangers of her reaction to this is the', 'aspect of sympathy which may be visited upon you by her sudden', 'surprise and reaction to this news. It has nothing to do with the', 'quantum of proof. The case rises or falls so far as I can see in this', 'case at this point on the testimony of the young complaining', 'witness, not on this mother or her reaction to the news of the', 'details allegedly experienced by her minor daughter. So I’m going', 'to instruct you not to have any sympathy for this woman because', 'of this revelation by the prosecution which apparently she has', 'never heard before.” The following exchange between the trial justice and Yvonne then took place:', '“[Trial Justice]: Is that correct, Miss, you had no idea the nature', 'of these acts?', '“[Yvonne]: No.', '“[Trial Justice]: Despite your repeated questions of her over time?', '“[Yvonne]: Yes.', '-8-', '“[Trial Justice]: You never heard [sic] a police report?', '“[Yvonne]: No.” The trial justice then further addressed the jury in the following words:', '“Okay. So her reaction has got nothing to do with this other', 'than her own unfortunate discovery of the nature of these', 'allegations. It doesn’t prove the allegations. Understand what I’m', 'saying? And I think that line of questioning was inappropriate. I’m', 'not going to do anything other than caution you not to allow this to', 'enter into your deliberations with regard to overt sympathy. You', 'may take this witness’s testimony and weigh it and sift as you', 'would anyone else, but you would give no great weight or allow', 'your deliberations to be swayed by the emotion that she has shown', 'by this apparent and recent discovery.”', 'At that point the questioning of Yvonne ceased, and Jessica’s sister Adriana was called to the stand.', '3.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness’s Sister', 'Adriana, Jessica’s older sister, was next called by the prosecution; she stated that she remembered defendant being in the bedroom which she shared with Jessica at the apartment on Charles Street during the night on two occasions. It was her testimony that, on one of those occasions (which she stated that she told her mother about), defendant was “looking out the window, the bedroom window.” It was further her testimony that, on the other occasion, she “woke up” and saw defendant “getting out up from [Jessica’s] bed;” she added that she pretended to be asleep and that defendant walked over, “sat on the end of [her] bed and then he left the room.” Adriana testified that she did not tell her mother about the second incident.', '-9-', 'B', 'The Jury Instructions, the Deliberations and the Verdict', 'After Adriana’s testimony, the prosecution rested, and defendant (after unsuccessfully moving for a judgment of acquittal) likewise rested without calling any witnesses. In the course of giving his final instructions to the jury, the trial justice stated:', '“With regard to the sympathy factor, let me reiterate my', 'comments about any undue sympathy which may have been', 'invoked in you by the emotional response of [Yvonne] on the stand', 'the other day. Sympathy, compassion, hatred, bias, any of the', 'human emotions that we all have and that we all experience have', 'no place in your deliberations.” After a day of deliberating the jury sent a note to the trial justice stating that it had reached a consensus on “12 of the 14 counts but [was] struggling to come up to a consensus on the other two.”', 'After receiving that note from the jury, the trial justice repeated his instructions concerning the issues to which the jury had pointed. That same day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on two counts of second-degree sexual assault, both of which arose from the first incident about which Jessica testified. Specifically, defendant was found guilty on Count One and Count Two which alleged “Hand to Vagina” and “Hand to Breast” respectively. The jury returned a not guilty verdict on the remaining twelve counts. In due course, the trial justice sentenced defendant on each of the two counts to twenty-five years imprisonment, with eight years to serve and seventeen years suspended, with probation.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant moved for a new trial, which motion was heard on December 2, 2011. The defendant argued that the jury’s verdict was “inconsistent” with the evidence presented at trial. It was his contention that there was “really * * * nothing different between” Jessica’s', '- 10 - testimony about the first incident of alleged sexual molestation and her testimony about the other incidents. Accordingly, defendant argued that, if the jury found Jessica to be a credible witness, it should have found him guilty on “all counts” and if it did not find her to be a credible witness it should have “acquitted him” on all counts. The defendant also pointed out that the first incident had the least evidentiary support since Jessica testified that she had “her eyes closed” and knew defendant only by his “rough hands.” The defendant characterized Jessica’s testimony as “robotic;” he added that her description of what had occurred was “done basically without any type of emotion[,] * * * almost in a script * * * .”', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion.', 'He found Jessica’s testimony to be “unemotional” but nevertheless “credible.” With respect to Yvonne, the trial justice stated that he found her to be “extremely credible particularly after she was made aware” of the specific allegations against defendant. The trial justice expressed his “surprise” that the jury convicted on only two of fourteen counts, and he found the verdict to be inconsistent. However, he declined to “disturb the finding of guilty on the first two counts.” The trial justice stated that the jury “understood the charge, and took their time.” He further stated that there could have been “some compromise” among the jurors or that the jury may not have believed that a “child of tender years” could have experienced the type of penetration Jessica described without “cry[ing] out.” The trial justice stated that a “reasonable inference[]” could be drawn from Jessica’s testimony that the perpetrator of the first incident of sexual assault (Counts One & Two) was defendant because he was the only adult male in the household.', '- 11 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in failing to grant his motion to pass the case subsequent to the prosecutor’s questioning on redirect examination of Yvonne with respect to the details of the assaults that defendant allegedly committed against Jessica (which questioning the trial justice characterized as “totally improper”); and (2) that, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence and inappropriately relied on Yvonne’s emotional response to the prosecutor’s questioning on redirect examination, which he had instructed the jury not to consider.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Motion to Pass the Case', '1. Standard of Review', 'It has been our consistent practice to review the decision of a trial justice on a motion to pass2 a case for abuse of discretion. State v.

We have conformed those headings to our usual style throughout this opinion.', '- 13 - adds that those questions “served no legitimate testimonial purpose.” The defendant avers that “the prejudice inuring from the prosecutor’s improper questioning was demonstrably incurable.” Moreover, according to defendant, the “most telling evidence” of the “prejudicial effect” of the prosecutor’s questioning “and of the ineffectiveness of the trial justice’s cautionary instruction” was that the trial justice himself referenced Yvonne’s breakdown as evidence of her credibility when ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, it is defendant’s contention that the trial justice recognized that the questioning was improper and prejudicial and therefore, that, he abused his discretion in not granting defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'In response, the state, “for its part, stands by the argument that the defendant opened the door to the prosecutor’s line of inquiry when, on cross-examination, counsel pressed [Yvonne] about her daughter’s failure to inform her mother of [defendant’s] conduct in explicit sordid detail * * * .” The state adds that it “respectfully disagrees with the trial justice’s determination that this line of questioning by the prosecutor was improper.” According to the state, the defendant cannot “justifiably complain that the prosecutor questioned [Yvonne] on re-direct examination concerning the very same information his counsel pressed that witness about on cross-examination.” (Emphasis in original.) The state avers that defendant “made an issue out of [Jessica’s] reluctance to disclose to [Yvonne] the specific details of [defendant’s] conduct” and, consequently, “when [defendant] claimed that [Jessica’s] silence on the matter of the sexual abuse was evidence of fabrication, it became the State’s job to provide the jury with an explanation for her hesitancy to confide such sordid information to her mother.” The state further contends that any prejudice which may have resulted from the questioning at issue was cured by the trial justice’s curative instruction to the jury.', '- 14 -', 'A trial justice, in considering a motion to pass a case, “must determine whether the evidence would cause the jurors to be so inflamed as to make them unable to decide the case on the basis of the evidence presented.” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1127 (R.I. 2005). “If the prejudice is inexpiable, the motion to pass should be granted. If the prejudice can be cured, the instructions which follow must be timely and effective.” Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70; see also Disla, 874 A.2d at 198. However, there is no “precise formula” to determine whether any prejudicial taint may have been cured by a cautionary instruction. Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1127; see also Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70. Therefore, “[e]ach case must be decided on an ad hoc basis and each challenged remark must be viewed in the context in which it appeared and in light of the attendant circumstances.” Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70-71. Since the trial justice decided to “utilize a cautionary instruction” in the instant case, “the question before us is whether [the trial justice’s] instruction can be fairly said to have removed from [the jurors’ minds], when weighing the evidence properly before them, the taint represented” by Yvonne’s emotional response to the prosecutor’s questions on redirect examination, which questions provided her, for the first time, with the specific details of the assaults to which her daughter was subjected. State v. Brown, 528 A.2d 1098, 1103 (R.I. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We need not, and consequently we do not, make any judgment on the propriety of the prosecutor’s questions to Yvonne; if we assume arguendo that those comments were inappropriate, it is nonetheless our conclusion that any prejudice which may have resulted was effectively and efficiently cured by the trial justice’s instruction to the jury.', 'Without any evidence “that the jury was not capable of complying with the trial justice[’s] cautionary instruction, this [C]ourt must assume that the jury did disregard the witness [reaction] as it was instructed to do.” Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted);', '- 15 - see also Mendoza, 889 A.2d at 159.', 'Unquestionably, “the entire rationale underlying the structure of jury trials and the lyrical deference that is paid to jury findings rests upon the proposition that jurors will obey the admonitions of the trial justice and will apply the law as given to them by the justice presiding.” Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mendoza, 889 A.2d at 159. In spite of defendant’s contention that any prejudice in the instant case was “demonstrably uncurable,” we can perceive nothing in the record that indicates that any taint which might have existed was not cured by the trial justice’s curative instruction; we likewise can perceive nothing in the record that indicates that the jury chose to disregard the trial justice’s curative instruction. See McManus, 941 A.2d at 234 (“[W]e cannot conclude that the jury would be so affected by the question that they would not be able to decide the case based on a dispassionate evaluation of the evidence.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'It is worth noting that the curative instruction given by the trial justice clearly and thoroughly explained to the jury that it was not to allow any sympathy which it might have for Yvonne to affect its determination as to her credibility or the credibility of the other witnesses. (We also note approvingly that the trial justice included a substantially similar instruction in his final charge to the jury.) He even reminded the jury that the case rose and fell “on the testimony of the young complaining witness.” The trial justice also gave the instruction in a timely manner, immediately after the questioning at issue. See Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 71. Moreover, we note that, despite Yvonne’s emotional response to the questioning on redirect examination, the jury nonetheless found defendant not guilty on twelve out of the fourteen counts against him. Lastly, it is worth remarking that the information which formed the basis of', '- 16 - the prosecutor’s questions was simply cumulative to other testimony at trial, and thus it was not a situation where the jury was exposed to additional, prejudicial information.', 'In our judgment, after reviewing the record, considering the context in which Yvonne’s emotional response was elicited, and the trial justice’s curative instruction, there is no reason to believe that the jury in the instant case was not able to make an objective evaluation of the evidence against Mr. Hie. See Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1127; Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70- 71. Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he denied defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', '1. Standard of Review', 'When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Barrios, 88 A.3d 1123, 1128 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Baker, 79 A.3d 1267, 1273 (R.I. 2013); State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013); State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011). In fulfilling his or her role as the thirteenth juror and passing on a motion for a new trial, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013); State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008); State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006). If, after carrying out this three-step analytical process, “the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or determines', '- 17 - that reasonable minds could differ, then the analysis is complete and the verdict should be affirmed.” State v.

However, if the trial justice “does not agree with the verdict or does not agree that reasonable minds could differ, then the trial justice must determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445 (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 102 (R.I. 2012).', 'With respect to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial, we have stated that the “record should reflect a few sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.”', 'State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Silva, 84 A.3d at 417. Nonetheless, we have also stated that, in providing the rationale for his or her decision, a trial justice does not need to “refer to all the evidence supporting the decision; rather, he or she need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 71 (R.I. 2012) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DiCarlo, 987 A.2d at 870.', 'We accord “great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Espinal, 943 A.2d at 1058; see also State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 983-84 (R.I. 2007). Accordingly, we will not disturb a trial justice’s decision with respect to a motion for a new trial “unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” DiCarlo, 987 A.2d at 871 (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v.

When conducting a review of a', '- 18 - denial of a motion for a new trial, “we do not focus on whether this Court simply agrees or disagrees with the trial justice’s credibility determinations,” but rather we are “deferential to those determinations;” and “we will not overturn that decision unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 842 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 104; Bunnell, 47 A.3d at 232-33. We have repeatedly noted that “[t]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Barrios, 88 A.3d at 1130; see also DiCarlo, 987 A.2d at 872.', '2. Discussion', 'The defendant contends that, in denying his motion for a new trial, “the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence which established doubt that [defendant] was the perpetrator of two counts of second degree child molestation.” Specifically, he claims that the close quarters in Jessica’s bedroom coupled with the fact that Jessica testified that she never cried out, the fact that her sisters never awoke at any point when Jessica was being assaulted, and the fact that Jessica never opened her eyes, calls “into question the reliability of [Jessica’s] testimony.” It is defendant’s position that “the jury surely wondered whether [Jessica’s] claims were the accurate memories of a young girl or imaginary nighttime visions” and, according to defendant, the trial justice should have “similarly scrutinized” Jessica’s claims.', 'The defendant also contends that, in denying his motion for a new trial, the trial justice improperly relied upon “deeply prejudicial testimony that he ordered stricken from the record.”', '- 19 - The defendant refers to the emotional response of Yvonne to the prosecutor’s questions on redirect examination, which questions disclosed the details of Jessica’s assaults to her mother for the first time. It is defendant’s contention that, if “an experienced, impartial jurist like [the trial justice] was so influenced by [Yvonne’s] emotional outburst that he did not follow his own cautionary instruction to the jury * * * it only follows that [Yvonne’s] reaction produced both passion and prejudice against [defendant] for those that observed her courtroom tears.”', 'The state avers that defendant’s argument is flawed given that it “overlooks the great weight accorded to the trial justice’s ruling;” it further contends that, by finding Jessica credible, the trial justice “articulated adequate reasoning to uphold the jury’s verdict and any consideration of the testimony of [Yvonne] was superfluous to the ruling.”', 'The trial justice in the instant case properly followed the required three-step analysis in ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial. First, he considered the evidence in light of the jury charge; the trial justice addressed with specificity the multiple incidents of sexual assault alleged by Jessica, and he noted that Adriana’s testimony “corroborated” Jessica’s testimony. He further considered Yvonne’s testimony with respect to the fact that she installed a lock on Jessica and Adriana’s bedroom, and he stated that “the inference was she was somewhat suspicious of defendant as the girls got older * * * .” In ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice considered the testimony of every witness who testified at trial. He also commented on the evidence in light of the jury charge on sexual assault. See Silva, 84 A.3d at 416.', 'Next, the trial justice properly weighed the evidence and addressed the credibility of the witnesses. See id. After explicitly recognizing that he had to conduct his own independent review of the evidence, the trial justice discussed Jessica’s testimony. He began by noting that she was “very unemotional” and “fairly monotone;” but he added that he did not find that', '- 20 - “totally unusual in cases like [the one before him].” He noted that, when Jessica testified regarding the assault for which defendant was convicted, she stated that she had her eyes closed but that she had felt “rough hands;” the trial justice added that a “reasonable inference” could be drawn from that testimony that defendant “perpetrated these crimes against her,” because “[h]e was the only adult in the building, living there” and Jessica “knew he was living there” and “had rough hands.” The trial justice concluded that Jessica was a “credible witness” and stated:', '“I thought that her testimony, while delivered in a monotone, flat', 'manner, was as a result of her embarrassment of having to live', 'through the motion, [sic] live through the emotion of telling the', 'story again that had happened so long ago, that she could look at it', 'perhaps from a distance now as a young woman and just relate', 'what she remembered from the facts.” The trial justice proceeded to find Adriana to be “credible” and Yvonne to be “extremely credible.” We note that the mere fact that defendant might disagree with the trial justice’s determination that each of the witnesses at trial was credible does not require the trial justice to grant defendant’s motion for a new trial. See id. at 418 (“This Court has repeatedly stated that [t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 103.', 'With relation to the third step in his analysis, the trial justice remarked that he was “surprised” by the verdict. However, he stated that there potentially might have been “some compromise” among the jurors. The trial justice concluded as follows:', '“[T]he Court believes that based on the evidence, based on the', 'credibility of the witnesses here, and based on particularly the fact', 'that there were five discreet [sic] instances complained of that the', 'Court cannot, I don’t disagree with the verdict because I thought', 'the witnesses were credible as to all counts * * * .”', '- 21 - Thus, it is clear that, after properly assessing the evidence and weighing the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice concluded that he could not “disagree with the [jury’s] verdict.” As such, his “analysis [was] complete,” and he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445. We perceive no error in the trial justice’s progression through the three required steps or in his conclusion that he could not “disagree with the verdict.”', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice did not properly take into account the fact that, as defendant states, the verdicts were “inconsistent.” However, the trial justice clearly addressed defendant’s argument that the verdicts were inconsistent; he stated that they were in fact “inconsistent.” See State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 291 (R.I. 2011). But he went on to state that Jessica was a credible witness and that it is possible that the jury compromised in finding defendant guilty on two of the fourteen counts. See id. at 292 (“We also recognize that in cases in which juries reach inconsistent verdicts on different counts of the same information, the jury may reach compromises through a variety of motivations, including leniency.”). Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly took into account the fact that the verdicts in this case could be characterized as inconsistent.', 'Finally, defendant takes issue with the trial justice’s reference to Yvonne’s emotional response to the questions regarding the specifics of Jessica’s sexual assault.', 'In denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice stated: “I thought the mother was extremely credible particularly after she was made aware of what the nature of the allegations was which apparently heretofore [she] had not been aware of.”', 'While it is true that the trial justice instructed the jury not to let sympathy affect their assessment of Yvonne’s testimony, he did not instruct the jury to utterly disregard her reaction. He expressly stated:', '“I’m not going to do anything other than caution you not to allow', '[the line of questioning on redirect examination] to enter into your', '- 22 -', 'deliberations with regard to overt sympathy. You may take this', 'witness’s testimony and weigh it and sift as you would anyone', 'else * * * .” In our view, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, it would have been preferable for the trial justice to pass over in silence Yvonne’s emotional breakdown on the witness stand; but there is nothing in the trial justice’s comments that would suggest that he was doing what he instructed the jury not to do—namely, letting sympathy affect his determination of Yvonne’s credibility. Therefore, we consider defendant’s contention that it was error for the trial justice to mention Yvonne’s emotional response in denying his motion for a new trial to be unavailing.', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material testimony and did not otherwise commit clear error in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.5 5', 'The defendant also raises a challenge to the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, which he made at the close of the prosecution’s case and at the close of all the evidence. It should be recalled that we have stated as follows:', '“When faced with a defendant’s challenge to the rulings on both [a', 'motion for a judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial],', 'this Court first conducts a review of the new-trial', 'motion. * * * The motion for a new trial requires a more exacting', 'analysis, * * * therefore unless a defendant can show that the', 'presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the', 'motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be', 'unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of', 'acquittal.” State v.

10,: v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The applicant, Roger T. Lamoureux, appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court denying his application for postconviction relief. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1990, applicant was convicted on one count of first-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2. He was sentenced to a term of twenty-five years imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with fifteen years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. This Court affirmed the conviction in 1993. State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9 (R.I. 1993).', '-1-', 'On October 24, 2001, applicant filed a pro se application for postconviction relief in Superior Court pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1; he based his application on his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and errors on the part of the trial justice. On February 9, 2004, the court-appointed attorney who was then representing applicant moved to withdraw as the attorney of record; in support of that motion, he filed a “no-merit” memorandum, pursuant to Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 136 (R.I. 2000).', 'It was the attorney’s opinion that the application for postconviction relief was “without merit” because applicant’s claims were either “frivolous” or had already been addressed by this Court on direct appeal. That same day, a hearing was held before a justice of the Superior Court on the attorney’s motion to withdraw, which hearing applicant attended.1 After that hearing, the hearing justice granted the attorney’s motion, and applicant proceeded pro se with respect to his application.2', 'After the hearing justice granted the court-appointed attorney’s motion to withdraw, the state filed a motion to dismiss the application for postconviction relief. On October 28, 2004, the parties again appeared before the hearing justice. At that hearing, applicant asserted that he had not yet had the opportunity to speak to an attorney with respect to his claim that his trial counsel had been ineffective; and he indicated that he needed an “evidentiary hearing” in order to substantiate that claim. The applicant acknowledged, however, that he had briefly met with his most recent court-appointed attorney prior to the latter’s filing of the Shatney memorandum, which memorandum addressed the merits of applicant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The hearing justice concluded the hearing without ruling on applicant’s application for 1', 'The record does not contain a transcript of the February 9, 2004 hearing. 2', 'On April 15, 2004, applicant again appeared before the hearing justice and made an oral motion requesting that the court appoint him another attorney, which motion was denied.', '-2- postconviction relief; he stated that, because of a scheduling issue, he would refer the matter to another hearing justice.', 'On November 3, 2004, a different hearing justice entered a prehearing order indicating that a final hearing on the application would be held on November 22, 2004. The order expressly stated that applicant “shall be prepared to offer any additional evidence as to the issues raised in his motion at that time” and that there would be no further continuances “except on just cause shown.” In due course,3 a final evidentiary hearing was held on the merits of applicant’s postconviction relief application. At that hearing, applicant stated that the only relevant issue was his claim that the conduct of his trial attorney had deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel—although applicant submitted no evidence in support of that claim at the hearing.4', 'On February 10, 2005, the hearing justice issued a written order denying the application.5 In that order, the hearing justice first addressed applicant’s contention that he was innocent of the crime of which he was convicted and applicant’s further contention that certain rulings by the trial justice constituted reversible error. The hearing justice ruled that those claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata because they had already been resolved in applicant’s direct appeal to this Court or could have been argued “during the trial proceeding or on direct appeal.” 3', 'The hearing originally scheduled for November 22, 2004 was continued to December 3, 2004. 4', 'At the December 3, 2004 hearing, applicant again asserted that he had not had meaningful representation with respect to his application for postconviction relief, and he contended that he was entitled to “compulsory process” and an opportunity to obtain an investigator in order to “bring forward evidence to substantiate [his] claim.” The applicant then referenced (without producing) several documents that he believed would help “substantiate” his claim that he had received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. 5', 'The state moved to dismiss the application on both procedural and substantive grounds. However, the hearing justice stated that he had decided to consider the merits of applicant’s claims for postconviction relief rather than grant the motion to dismiss the application on purely procedural grounds.', '-3- The hearing justice further found that, while applicant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was properly before the court, applicant had failed to establish that, under the first prong of the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984), his trial attorney’s “professional decisions or conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonable professional competent assistance.” Accordingly, the hearing justice stated that applicant’s request for postconviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be denied. The applicant filed a timely appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The statutory remedy of postconviction relief created by § 10-9.1-1 is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interests of justice.” Lynch v. State, 86 A.3d 390, 391 (R.I. 2014) (mem.) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is well settled that “[a]n applicant for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted in his or her case.” Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677, 679 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal, we are deferential to the hearing justice’s findings of fact, and we will not disturb a hearing justice’s “factual findings made on an application for post- conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that [he or she] overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.” Spratt v. State, 41 A.3d 984, 988 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-4-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, applicant sets forth his contentions, in a list format with little elaboration, as follows: (1) “[t]hat the trial Judge erroneously gave the jury a cautionary instruction;” (2) “[t]hat the trial Judge erroneously allowed the introduction of a prejudicial vaginal swab;” (3) “[t]hat the trial Judge denied his right to a fair trial;” and (4) that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his trial attorney.', 'The applicant further contends that the hearing justice committed clear error or abused his discretion in denying his application because he “was not given a proper evidentiary hearing” at which he might submit evidence in support of his claims. After reviewing the record, it is our opinion that applicant’s contentions are wholly without merit.', 'The four above-summarized claims with respect to the trial proceedings that applicant asserts on appeal are the same claims that were already considered by both his court-appointed attorney in that attorney’s Shatney memorandum and by the hearing justice in his order denying the application. In view of the deferential standard that we apply in considering a denial of an application for postconviction relief, we are unable to conclude that the hearing justice committed clear error or misconceived material evidence in rendering his decision. See Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 1283 (R.I. 2012). The applicant’s claims relating to alleged errors committed by the trial justice are clearly barred by the doctrine of res judicata as set forth in § 10-9.1-8 because they were either raised and denied in applicant’s direct appeal to this Court or could have been raised at that time. See Ferrell v.

He chose not to do so. Moreover, after the October 28, 2004 hearing, the applicant was expressly instructed by court order to “be prepared to offer any additional evidence” with respect to his claims for postconviction relief at a final hearing on his application. Nonetheless, at the December 3, 2004 hearing, the applicant was not prepared to do so. It is worth noting that the applicant filed his application for postconviction relief in 2001—approximately four years before the hearing justice rendered his decision—and that the applicant was provided with several court-appointed attorneys in the Superior Court and is represented by yet another attorney on appeal. It is clear to us that the applicant had both the time and opportunity to obtain evidence to substantiate his claims and to present that evidence in court. The applicant, however, despite his numerous opportunities, has not presented any evidence that would prove or even lend substance to the viability of his claim that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel.

11,Ernest Barone : v. : State of Rhode Island et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, Ernest Barone, appeals pro se to this Court from an order of the Superior Court granting a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, the State of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 2, 2012, plaintiff filed a complaint pro se in the Superior Court seeking “declaratory, injunctive, [and] equitable relief and reimbursement of sales taxes imposed and collected by the State of Rhode Island, Division of Taxation on motor vehicle property taxes collected from citizens * * * who lease rather than own their motor vehicles.” In that complaint,', '-1- plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of G.L. 1956 § 44-18-12(a); in another count, plaintiff also brought a statutory claim, arguing that lessees of motor vehicles are “entitled to a refund of sales taxes paid on excise taxes because the property tax and sales taxes thereon are separately stated in both the Lease Agreement and the monthly billing statements of the Lessor, and consequently fall within the exception to the definition of ‘[s]ales [p]rice’ contained in * * * §[]44-18-12(b)(iv).” (Emphasis in original.) It was further plaintiff’s contention that he was a member of a class, which class he argued met the requirements necessary to certify his complaint as a class action.', 'As alleged in plaintiff’s complaint, this case stems from a September 5, 2009 agreement in which plaintiff agreed to lease a motor vehicle from a company called “Nissan of Smithfield.” On the basis of monthly lease statements that plaintiff received from “Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation,” he learned that he had been charged “separately * * * for property tax on the leased vehicle and an additional seven (7) percent sales tax charged on that amount * * * .” Subsequently, plaintiff filed a claim for a refund with the Division of Taxation in the amount of the sales tax that he had paid on the property tax assessed on his leased vehicle. In due course, on September 5, 2012, the tax administrator rendered a final decision denying plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff thereafter filed an appeal pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 44-19-18 and § 44-19-25 to the Sixth Division District Court contemporaneously with his filing of the complaint in the present action in Superior Court.', 'In plaintiff’s Superior Court complaint, he contended that he had pursued administrative remedies as required by law. He added, however, that he deemed judicial review pursuant to §§ 44-19-18; 44-19-19; 44-19-25 to be inadequate for two reasons:', '“(1) the District Court does not have jurisdiction to enter', 'declaratory, injunctive, equitable relief or damages pursuant to', '-2-', 'R.I.G.L. §[]9-30-1 et seq.[; and] (2) the District Court does not', 'have the equitable power to certify a class under the District', 'Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 whereas the Superior', 'Court does have the power to certify a class under the Superior', 'Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23.” (Emphasis in', 'original.)', 'Subsequently, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction over “tax matters.” Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association of America v. State, 541 A.2d 69, 73 (R.I. 1988). The defendants cited this Court’s opinion in Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 73, as being dispositive of the instant case; and they requested that the Superior Court dismiss plaintiff’s complaint and “allow[]” the then-pending appeal in the District Court to proceed. The plaintiff filed an objection to defendants’ motion to dismiss, and he reiterated that he was seeking declaratory relief and class certification and that only the Superior Court had jurisdiction with respect to same.', 'On January 29, 2013, a hearing was held before a justice of the Superior Court. At that hearing, plaintiff stated that the only issue before the court was “whether or not the [c]ourt has subject matter jurisdiction, not whether or not the [proposed] class is certifiable.”1 After the parties presented their arguments, the hearing justice concluded as follows:', '“[A]s in Owner[]-Operators, the gravamen of this case is a case of', 'tax and * * * the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction over that,', 'and * * * not only does it have exclusive jurisdiction, the Supreme', 'Court has clearly stated that the District Court can entertain both 1', 'Based on plaintiff’s representation at the January 29, 2013 hearing that his argument with respect to class certification (i.e., that the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over his claims because the District Court could not certify a class) was not before the court, we need say no more about that issue. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41-42 n. 4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”).', '-3-', 'an equitable claim related to that case as well as a constitutional', 'claim.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.', 'On appeal, plaintiff posits that the following issues are before this Court: (1) “whether [he] has an adequate remedy at law in District Court;” (2) “whether the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case;” and (3) whether the doctrines set forth in Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429 (R.I. 2005), Johnston Businessmen’s Association v. aaRussillo, 108 R.I. 257, 274 A.2d 433 (1971), and McTwiggan v. Hunter, 18 R.I. 776, 30 A. 962 (1895), “supersede” this Court’s holding in Owner-Operators. It is plaintiff’s contention that his remedy in the District Court is inadequate because, in his view, “the District Court can, at most, grant reimbursement of the sales tax to the plaintiff and other taxpayers who may have sought relief * * * whereas * * * if the tax is found to be unconstitutional and illegal [by the Superior Court], every individual who paid the tax would be entitled to reimbursement whether or not he filed an administrative claim for reimbursement.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is a fundamental principle that subject matter jurisdiction is “an indispensable requisite in any judicial proceeding,” as it represents “the very essence of the court’s power to hear and decide a case.” Long v.

Chapter 19 of title 44 (which chapter is entitled “Sales and Use Taxes–Enforcement and Collection”) expressly provides a procedure for the appeal of decisions by the tax administrator; § 44-19-25 clearly reads in pertinent as follows:', '“[I]f the taxpayer is aggrieved by the decision of the tax', 'administrator, the taxpayer may petition the sixth (6th) division of', 'the district court for relief from the decision of the tax', 'administrator.” See also § 44-19-18 (stating that “[a]ppeals', 'from * * * decisions made pursuant to any provisions of this', 'chapter are to the sixth (6th) division district court pursuant to', 'chapter 8 of title 8”). With respect to such an appeal to the District Court, G.L. 1956 § 8-8-24 further specifies that “[e]ach appeal of a final decision of the tax administrator * * * shall be an original, independent proceeding in the nature of a suit in equity to set aside the final decision * * * .” Finally, we note that § 8-8-3(a)(6) provides that “[t]he district court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of * * * [a]ll * * * actions, proceedings, and matters of whatever nature which are or shall be declared to be within the jurisdiction of the court by the laws of the state.”', '-5-', 'Based on these statutory provisions, it is clear to us in the instant case, just as it was clear to us in 1988 when we issued our unanimous opinion in Owner-Operators, that the General Assembly has conferred upon the District Court exclusive jurisdiction over “tax matters,” in addition to the authority to adjudicate “all claims for relief attached to the underlying matter.” Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 73 (stating that “the proper forum for judicial review of rulings by the tax administrator is clearly in the District Court” and further stating that, “[s]ince the District Court retains exclusive jurisdiction over tax disputes, it is necessary that the District Court retain power to decide all claims for relief attached to the underlying matter”).', 'In Owner-Operators, the plaintiffs “filed a class-action complaint” in Superior Court seeking a tax refund as well as a declaratory judgment to the effect that a certain tax statute was unconstitutional; the plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief. Id. at 70. We determined that the “gravamen” of the plaintiffs’ complaint was a “tax matter.” Id. at 72. On the basis of that determination, we stated that we considered ourselves “bound by the Legislature’s mandate that provides that tax disputes are within the statutory scheme that vests exclusive jurisdiction of this particular subject matter in the District Court.” Id. at 73. Significantly, we then proceeded to state that, based on our reading of the relevant statutory scheme,2 the General Assembly, “by vesting the District Court with exclusive jurisdiction over tax matters, implied that the District Court is empowered to administer full relief, including adjudication of challenges to the 2', 'Although the Court, in reaching its holding in Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association of America v. State, 541 A.2d 69, 73 (R.I. 1988), relied in part on the language of G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15 (the section of the Administrative Procedures Act entitled “Judicial review of contested cases”), it is clear that the Court’s determination in that case would have been the same had it evaluated the plaintiffs’ contention under G.L. 1956 § 44-19-18, which provides for judicial review by the District Court of determinations by the tax administrator with respect to sales and use taxes. See Herald Press, Inc. v. Norberg, 122 R.I. 264, 271, 405 A.2d 1171, 1176 (1979) (noting that the “procedures and standards of review contained in § 42-35-15[] were clearly intended to be incorporated into the provisions of § 44-19-18”).', '-6- constitutionality of tax statutes and claims for equitable relief that relate to tax disputes.” Id. It was our opinion that, “[t]o allow claims for tax refunds to be removed from the District Court because a claim for equitable relief is included would effectually permit the circumvention of the statutory system that exists for resolution of tax disputes.” Id. at 74. In so holding, we intended to “advance the Legislature’s objectives of judicial economy, fairness to litigants, and the elimination of duplicative proceedings.” Id. at 73.', 'The plaintiff’s contention that our holding in Owner-Operators has somehow been “supersede[d]” by our holdings in Pollard, 870 A.2d at 433-34, Johnston Businessmen’s Association, 108 R.I. at 260-61, 274 A.2d at 435-36, and McTwiggan, 18 R.I. at 778-79, 30 A. at 963, is meritless. The cases of Johnston Businessmen’s Association and McTwiggan predate Owner-Operators and were decided before the General Assembly granted the District Court exclusive jurisdiction over “tax matters” in 1984. See Old Colony Bank v. Clark, 517 A.2d 249, 250 (R.I. 1986). Therefore, those two cases are not relevant to our analysis. Although Pollard was decided after Owner-Operators, that decision addressed the issue of whether or not a certain constitutional argument had been waived—not the issue of subject matter jurisdiction over tax disputes. Pollard, 870 A.2d at 433-34. Furthermore, it is worth noting that we have since reiterated our holding in Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 73, that the District Court has exclusive jurisdiction over “tax matters” and all related claims—viz., in the more recently decided case of Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074, 1080 (R.I. 2009).3 It is clear, therefore, that Owner-Operators is still good law, and it is our judgment that our holding therein is wholly dispositive of the issue before us. See Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 72. 3', 'Although the Court in Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074 (R.I. 2009), distinguished Owner-Operators on the basis of the causes of action that were at issue in Long, it nonetheless paraphrased with approval the holding in Owner-Operators. Long, 984 A.2d at 1080.', '-7-', 'The case of Owner-Operators involved an analogous set of circumstances to those that the instant action involves; and, it is our opinion, as it was in Owner-Operators, that the “gravamen”4 of the claim at issue is clearly a tax dispute. See id. at 70, 72. Therefore, the appropriate judicial forum for resolution of the plaintiff’s claim is the District Court. See Long, 984 A.2d at 1080 (“The crucial teaching that we glean from [the] holding [in Owner-Operators] is: what is the gravamen of the claim?', 'If the complaint raises an issue of taxation by a governmental body, then it should follow the administrative procedures laid out by the General Assembly and appeal to the District Court.”). In light of the District Court’s “power to decide all claims for relief attached to the underlying matter,” we fail to perceive any merit in the plaintiff’s claim that his remedy at law is inadequate. Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 73. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The record in this case may be remanded to that tribunal. 4', 'The word “gravamen” is used almost exclusively in legal writing.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Brown University and Quest entered into a Professional Services Agreement (PSA), in which Brown retained Quest as an independent contractor, responsible for performing “certain clinical laboratory testing for students and employees” at the Brown University health center. The PSA set forth policies for the performance of certain tests, and required both parties to procure four types of insurance coverage: workers’ compensation insurance, general liability insurance, “All Risk” property insurance, and professional liability insurance. Notably, the agreement obligated both to name the other party as an additional insured under their general liability policies; there was no requirement that they do so for any of the other types of insurance. Brown secured insurance through Pinnacle and excess insurance through Genesis.', 'On May 10, 2006, Pauline Hall, a graduate student at Brown University, sought treatment at the university’s health services clinic. At the time, Ms. Hall was experiencing a sore throat, nausea, and ear pain. She was seen by Rita Shiff, a physician’s assistant who was employed by Brown. Ms. Shiff ordered a rapid strep test, to be performed by Quest. The test was not performed promptly, and results were not returned to the health center. 1 When Ms. Hall returned to the health center on May 12, 2006, she was diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome—an illness that resulted in a prolonged hospital stay and permanent injuries. 1', 'Precisely how the test went astray is a matter of some dispute. Brown argues that Quest violated the policies set forth in the Professional Services Agreement (PSA) by failing to send the test sample to the nearest facility and, as a result, the test was not performed. Quest argues that the error was caused by a Brown employee who was covering the Quest desk during lunch.', '-2-', 'On June 26, 2006, Brown notified Pinnacle and Quest of the incident and the potential claim arising from it. 2 On March 24, 2008, Ms. Hall filed suit in Superior Court against Ms. Shiff, Brown, and Quest, alleging, inter alia, that Quest failed to exercise the “degree and skill expected of [a] reasonably competent provider of laboratory services” in failing to process the test and in failing to provide the results of the testing in a timely manner. On December 10, 2010, Brown and Ms. Shiff filed a cross-claim against Quest, alleging that Quest negligently failed to “properly process the Rapid Strep test, * * * and to communicate the results” of the test to the health center. In addition to the negligence claim, Brown asserted claims for breach of contract, indemnification, and contribution.', 'On May 4, 2011, Ms. Hall settled her claims with Brown and its insurers, Pinnacle and Genesis.', 'Quest did not participate in the settlement, and the Brown cross-claim was not resolved. On July 15, 2011, Quest sent a letter to Brown’s counsel, demanding, for the first time, “a complete defense and indemnification from Pinnacle,” and requesting that Brown’s counsel forward the letter to Pinnacle and provide the relevant contact information to Quest. When Quest did not receive a reply, it sent a follow-up letter on July 27, 2011. Genesis, the excess insurer, never received a copy of these letters.', 'On November 7, 2011, Quest filed the instant action, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to a defense from Pinnacle and indemnification under the Pinnacle and Genesis policies.

This coverage was packaged together under one policy number. Pinnacle asserts that Quest is covered only under the general liability provisions, which are inapplicable to the claims asserted in the underlying action and cross-claim. Quest concedes that there are two coverages, but argues that there is only one policy with one policy number; thus Quest asserts that it is an additional insured under all of the coverage parts.', 'Although it appears (and Pinnacle concedes) that Quest is a named insured under the general liability coverage, there are two dozen numbered endorsements that modify coverage;', '-6- two of these endorsements are pertinent to this dispute.', 'After referencing the section of Coverage A that covers bodily injury, Endorsement No. 7 modifies that provision, stating:', '“COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM', '“INCIDENTAL MALPRACTICE COVERAGE/HOSPITAL', 'PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY EXCLUSION', '“***', '“However, this policy does not apply to bodily injury arising out of', 'the following activities or services conducted at or performed in a', 'hospital setting or a Student/Employee Healthcare Facility:', '“1. The rendering of or failure to render:', '“(a) Medical, surgical, dental, x-ray, or nursing service or', 'treatment, or the furnishing of food or beverages in', 'connection therewith; or', '“(b) any service or treatment conducive to health or of a', 'professional nature; or', '“(c) any cosmetic or tonsorial service or treatment.” Brown’s cross-claim, based on the allegations in Ms. Hall’s complaint, unambiguously alleges a cause of action that arose from Quest’s negligence in failing to perform a test—certainly a service conducive to health—in a manner consistent with that of a “reasonably competent provider of laboratory services,” which is the standard of care in any professional liability action. See Restatement (Second) Torts § 299A at 73 (1965) (“[O]ne who undertakes to render services in the practice of a profession or trade is required to exercise the skill and knowledge normally possessed by members of that profession or trade in good standing * * * .”).', 'Endorsement 7, therefore, specifically excludes coverage for Quest with regard to professional liability under the general liability coverage of the Pinnacle policy.', 'Quest argues that Ms. Hall’s injury did not arise from, or at least not entirely from, services performed at the health center because the failure to perform a rapid strep test occurred', '-7- offsite, at one of Quest’s other testing facilities. However, the action that allegedly led directly to Ms. Hall’s injury—the placing of her test sample in the wrong bag, thus sending it to the wrong facility—occurred at the health center. The allegations that Quest failed to test promptly, and to notify Brown as required by the PSA, all flow from that first error. Accordingly, the actions alleged in the initial complaint and in Brown’s cross-complaint fall squarely within Endorsement 7, excluding professional liability coverage from the general liability coverage.', 'Quest further argues that the conduct at issue was not professional, but merely administrative. This argument is unavailing. Brown contracted with Quest for the professional service of providing clinical laboratory testing. The contract is entitled “Professional Services Agreement,” thus clearly indicating that Quest was to perform services “of a professional nature.” Just as doctors spend time charting, and lawyers scheduling, professional services necessarily include a number of administrative tasks. The PSA specifically includes some of these tasks, requiring Quest to provide courier service, report STAT test results within one to three hours of receipt of the test, and fax results when completed. Accordingly, all aspects of testing, including routing the sample to the appropriate laboratory, are a professional service and are excluded from the general liability coverage in the Pinnacle policy. 4', 'Quest next argues that it is an additional insured under the professional liability coverage offered by Pinnacle. Endorsement 17 provides coverage for professional liability on a claims- made basis and contains the following exclusion: 4', 'In Ho Rath v. Rhode Island Hospital, 89 A.3d 806 (R.I. 2014), a case involving the statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions, we opined that laboratories such as Quest are not included within this state’s statutory definition of medical malpractice. See G.L. 1956 § 5-37- 1(8). In the instant case, however, the specific language agreed to in the contractual PSA provides an arguably broader basis than the narrower language in the medical malpractice statute.', '-8-', '“1. This coverage does not apply to:', '“A. Any claim for bodily injury, sickness, disease or death', 'of any person; but this exclusion shall not apply if such', 'bodily injury, sickness, disease or death is a result of', 'any act, error or omission committed in a', 'student/employee health care facility subsequent to', '7/1/80 as a result of the following:', '“1. The rendering of or failure to render:', '“(a) medical, surgical, dental, x-ray, or nursing service or', 'treatment or furnishing of food or beverages in connection', 'therewith; or', '“(b) any service or treatment conducive to health or of a', 'professional nature; or', '“(c) any cosmetic or tonsorial service or treatment.” Thus, Endorsement 17 covers the activities that are specifically excluded from the general liability coverage in Endorsement 7. Quest contends that because it is an additional insured under Pinnacle’s policy, it is therefore an additional insured under all coverage parts of the policy.', 'To adopt Quest’s reading of the policy would be to ignore the plain meaning of Endorsement 4, which defines an additional insured as “any person, corporation, company, organization, estate or other entity but only to the extent the Named Insured has agreed to do so.” (Emphasis added.) The source of Brown’s assent to coverage of Quest as an additional insured is found in the PSA, in which Brown agrees to name Quest as an additional insured on its general liability coverage. There is no requirement, nor is there any agreement to be found, that Brown provide professional liability coverage to Quest. As we previously have stated, “We do not engage in mental gymnastics * * * to read ambiguity into a policy where none is present.” Peloquin, 61 A.3d at 432 (quoting Sjogren v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 703 A.2d 608, 610 (R.I. 1997)). Having carefully examined the policy and the PSA from which', '-9- it stems, we cannot conclude that Brown gratuitously obtained professional liability insurance for its independent contractor in addition to the coverage it obtained for itself.', 'The language of the PSA and the Pinnacle policy is clear and unambiguous—although Quest is an additional insured under the general liability coverage, it is not an insured under the professional liability coverage. Because the claims against Quest allege professional negligence, they fall within the purview of professional liability insurance and the PSA. Accordingly, Pinnacle has no duty to defend nor to indemnify Quest in this action.', 'Quest also argues that it qualifies for excess coverage from Genesis under its 2010/2011 policy. We need not address whether coverage under this latter policy is even relevant given the date of Ms. Hall’s claim, because Genesis’s Commercial Excess Policy coverage is predicated on the existence of coverage flowing from the underlying Pinnacle policy. The Genesis policy defines an insured in a similar manner to the Pinnacle policy, extending insured status to entities “only to the extent the ‘Named Insured’ [Brown] has agreed to do so in writing prior to an occurrence.”', 'Because there was no agreement to name Quest as an additional insured for purposes of professional liability coverage, for the reasons stated above, Quest is not an insured for professional liability under the Genesis policy.', 'Finally, Quest argues that Pinnacle and Genesis waived their rights to deny coverage by not responding to Quest’s demand for coverage in a timely manner. Because the claim against Quest for general liability was not covered, and Quest was not an insured under the professional liability section, neither Pinnacle nor Genesis had a duty to defend it. Absent such duty, estoppel cannot be employed to expand coverage to Quest. “The relevant cases are clear * * * that the doctrine of estoppel cannot be used to enlarge coverage beyond that which is set out in the', '- 10 - policy.” General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. American National Fireproofing, Inc., 716 A.2d 751, 755 (R.I. 1998).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record of this case shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Robinson, concurring. After long hesitation, I have now concluded that I am able to concur with the result reached by the majority in this exceedingly difficult case, although the route that I have traveled to reach that conclusion is somewhat different from that traveled by the majority. 5', 'I begin by stating that it is patent (in my opinion) that the insurance policy at issue (a document which bears just one policy number for what is arguably two policies) is internally inconsistent and, therefore, ambiguous. It has been this Court’s holding that “an agreement is ambiguous only when it is reasonably and clearly susceptible to more than one interpretation.” W.P. Associates v. Forcier, Inc., 637 A.2d 353, 356 (R.I. 1994); see Isbrandtsen v. North Branch Corp., 556 A.2d 81, 84 (Vt. 1988) (“Ambiguity will be found where a writing in and of itself supports a different interpretation from that which appears when it is read in light of the surrounding circumstances, and both interpretations are reasonable.”); see also Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 425 (R.I. 2009); see generally Steven W. Feldman & James A. DeLanis, Resolving Contractual Ambiguity in Tennessee: A Systematic Approach, 68 Tenn. L. Rev. 73, 88 (2000).', 'It is my considered opinion that, when looking at the language of 5', 'Nothing that I say in this concurrence should be understood as suggesting that the analysis contained in the majority opinion is less than scholarly.', '- 11 - Endorsement 4, Endorsement 7, and Endorsement 17 of the insurance contract at issue in this case, one could reasonably come to the conclusion that the insurance contract was intended to be one policy, with Quest being an additional insured for all terms in the policy (including Endorsement 17) because Quest falls within the language of Endorsement 4. However, one could also make a reasonable determination, based on the same language, that Endorsement 17 was intended to be a separate policy under which Quest was not an additional insured. Thus, the insurance contract is ambiguous. See Lynch, 965 A.2d at 425.', 'I recognize that there is precedent which would support the principle that, if the insurance contract is ambiguous, it must be construed against the insurance company (i.e., the contra proferentem canon of construction). See, e.g., Koziol v. Peerless Insurance Co., 41 A.3d 647, 651 (R.I. 2012) (“An ambiguity in an insurance policy is strictly construed against the insurer.”); Elliott Leases Cars, Inc. v. Quigley, 118 R.I. 321, 328, 373 A.2d 810, 813 (1977) (noting that this Court has “in the past characterized [insurance contracts] as contracts of adhesion” and stating that “[i]t is well-established that ambiguities [in an insurance contract] will be construed so as to bear most heavily against the insurer”).', 'However, that is simply one canon of construction and not the one which, in my opinion, is most properly applicable in the instant case. See Payless Shoesource, Inc. v. Travelers Companies, Inc., 585 F.3d 1366, 1372 (10th Cir. 2009). “[A]s every judge knows, the canons of construction are many and their interaction complex. The canons are not mandatory rules.”', 'Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 598 F.3d 1191, 1196 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 534 U.S. 84, 94 (2001) (“For one thing, canons are not mandatory rules. They are guides that need not be conclusive.”) (internal quotation marks', '- 12 - omitted). Indeed, with respect to the contra proferentem canon itself, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has aptly stated:', '“The sensibility of the contra proferentem canon of', 'construction * * * rests in large measure on an assumption of', 'unequal bargaining strength between the seller and', 'purchaser, * * * supposing as it does the prototypical case of a', 'large insurance company essentially dictating its terms in an', 'adhesion contract to individuals with relatively little bargaining', 'power. It is less clear whether and to what degree the doctrine has', 'an appropriate role to play when the contracting parties are as', 'sophisticated and able as [the companies involved in the case] both', 'assuredly are.” Payless Shoesource, Inc., 585 F.3d at 1372', '(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wood River Pipeline', 'Co. v.

While the contra proferentem canon can be an important tool in dealing with ambiguous contractual language, we should not, in this rather unusual case, have resort to that principle because the fog of ambiguity that otherwise envelops the Pinnacle policy can be dispelled by referring to extrinsic evidence—namely, the PSA entered into by Quest and Brown. See W.P. Associates, 637 A.2d at 356 (“If a document is susceptible to more than one interpretation, extrinsic evidence is admissible to aid in its interpretation.”). 6', 'See Harry G. Prince, Contract Interpretation in California: Plain Meaning, Parol Evidence and Use of the “Just Result” Principle, 31 Loy. L.A. L.

See Koziol, 41 A.3d at 651. In this instance, however, we are faced with (in the Pinnacle policy) an imperfect execution of what the PSA clearly reflects should have been produced; rather than looking at the subjective intent of each party, in my view, the Court should consider extrinsic evidence in an effort to glean the mutual intent of the parties. See Lexington Insurance Co. v. General Accident Insurance Co. of America, 338 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 2003) (“If * * * a policy provision is ambiguous, the court may take extrinsic evidence as to intent * * * .”); Harrigan v.

Feldman & James A. DeLanis, 68 Tenn. L. Rev. at 73 (“When courts interpret contracts, their purpose is to effectuate the parties’ mutual intent.”).', 'When I refer to considering extrinsic evidence in this case, I specifically have in mind the PSA between Quest and Brown. Even though the Pinnacle policy does not explicitly reference the PSA, it does, in Endorsement 4, provide that a “[n]amed [i]nsured” would include any “corporation, company, organization, estate or other entity but only to the extent [Brown] has agreed to do so.” See Haffenreffer v. Haffenreffer, 994 A.2d 1226, 1232 (R.I. 2010) (stating that “[o]ur case law is clear that instruments referred to in a written contract may be regarded as incorporated by reference and thus may be considered in the construction of the contract”) (internal quotation marks omitted). When one lays the PSA beside the Pinnacle policy, it is clear that the PSA enlightens one as to how the Pinnacle policy should have been worded. A thorough', '- 14 - assessment of the PSA makes clear that, regardless of the ambiguous language in the Pinnacle policy, the mutual intent of Brown and Quest at the time they signed that PSA was for Brown to name Quest as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy, not its professional liability insurance policy. See Hill v. M. S. Alper & Son, Inc., 106 R.I. 38, 47, 256 A.2d 10, 15 (1969) (“[W]e will * * * consider the situation of the parties and the accompanying circumstances at the time the contract was entered into, not for the purpose of modifying or enlarging or curtailing its terms, but to aid in the interpretative process and to assist in determining its meaning.”). Although the Pinnacle policy is ambiguous, the terms of the PSA indicate that the mutual intent of the parties was to exclude Quest from the insurance coverage provided in Endorsement 17. See Grun v. Pneumo Abex Corp., 163 F.3d 411, 420 (7th Cir. 1998) (stating that, even where contract language is ambiguous, the court will look beyond it “where literal application of a text would * * * thwart the obvious intentions of its drafters”) (internal quotation marks omitted); White v. Roughton, 689 F.2d 118, 120 (7th Cir. 1982) (“[T]he overriding purpose in construing a contract is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties at the time the contract was made; and while the language of the contract is normally the best evidence of that intent, a court can properly disregard even unambiguous language when it is convinced that the parties meant something different from what they said.”). Therefore, in my judgment, Quest is not entitled to a defense and/or indemnification from Pinnacle (or Genesis).

13,: v. : Gregory Hebert et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case arises out of claims of negligence and wrongful death brought by the plaintiffs, Kimberly S. Phelps and Thomas Phelps (collectively, plaintiffs), individually and as co-administrators of the Estate of Ashley R. Phelps, alleging that two named defendants, Leo R. Pelletier and Susan Pelletier (collectively, defendants or Pelletiers), negligently allowed a guest at their son’s graduation party to operate an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in a reckless manner, resulting in the death of the plaintiffs’ daughter, Ashley. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that a Superior Court justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 2, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues presented in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a thorough review of the arguments and the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and thus the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The tragic events giving rise to this case began on June 23, 2007, when the Pelletiers hosted a party at their home, located at 51 Sharon Drive in Coventry, Rhode Island, to celebrate the college graduation of their son, Ross. Approximately eighty people were invited to the party, including Gregory Hebert (Hebert), Ross’s friend from high school. Although the party was an all-day event, Hebert arrived in the afternoon, with a case of beer as a gift for Ross. According to Hebert, during his time at the party he consumed “no more than two beers,” and did not drink any of the alcoholic beverages that were supplied by the Pelletiers.1', 'Later that evening, Hebert left the party with Michael S. Vingi (Vingi) in order to retrieve a recently purchased ATV from his home. Vingi drove Hebert’s pickup truck to the house, where Hebert retrieved the ATV from a locked shed on the property. Hebert then drove the ATV “a mile or two” back to the party, with Vingi following in the pickup truck. Once they arrived at the Pelletiers’ house, Hebert left the ATV in the front yard—near other ATVs in the driveway— and proceeded to rejoin the party in the backyard. Rosalyn Smith (Smith), a guest at the party, asked Hebert for a ride on his ATV. Despite the fact that the ATV was designed for only one person, Hebert agreed. Before embarking, Hebert asked Smith if she wanted to wear a helmet; Smith declined and Hebert drove the ATV—with Smith on the back—down Sharon Drive, where they stopped to talk to Smith’s brother, who lived at the end of the street. Hebert and Smith then returned to the Pelletiers’ house on the ATV.', 'At approximately 10:15 p.m., Ashley Phelps (Ashley or decedent) requested a ride on Hebert’s ATV. Hebert offered Ashley a helmet—which she declined—and asked her to dispose of her drink and cigarette before climbing on the vehicle. With Ashley on the back of the ATV, 1', 'Underage drinking does not play a role in this tragedy.', '-2- Hebert proceeded down the driveway toward Mrs. Pelletier. According to Hebert, Mrs. Pelletier moved a party cooler in order for Hebert to maneuver the ATV and gain access to the street. Although Hebert stated that he could not recall if Mrs. Pelletier said anything to him at that point, Mrs. Pelletier stated in her deposition testimony that she did not move the cooler to allow the ATV to pass; however, she testified that she told Hebert that the party was neither the “time [n]or place” for ATV rides, to which Ashley replied that Hebert was “a good driver.” It is undisputed that Hebert then left the Pelletiers’ property and traveled down the street, where he crashed the ATV, causing it to roll over and eject Ashley onto the driveway at 39 Sharon Drive. After the accident, Hebert fled on the ATV, abandoning a grievously injured Ashley, who suffered traumatic brain injuries.2 Ashley died nine days later.', 'On October 29, 2007, plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against Hebert, and in an amended complaint on June 18, 2010, plaintiffs added the Pelletiers as defendants, including counts of negligence and wrongful death against them.3 The plaintiffs alleged that defendants owed a duty of care to provide for a safe environment for the guests on their property, including the decedent, who attended the graduation party at their home. The plaintiffs further argued that the Pelletiers breached this duty of care by allowing a dangerous condition—namely, Hebert’s ATV—to be on their property and to be operated in a reckless manner.', 'The Pelletiers filed a motion for summary judgment that was heard by a justice of the 2', 'Hebert was later charged with leaving the scene of an accident, death resulting. He subsequently pled nolo contendere to driving to endanger, death resulting, and was sentenced to a two-year prison term at the Adult Correctional Institutions. 3', 'Michael Vingi, Gregory’s father Bruce Hebert, and GE Money Bank—which financed the ATV—were also named as defendants in the amended complaint. Final judgments were subsequently entered in favor of Bruce Hebert and Michael Vingi after their separate motions for summary judgment were granted. The plaintiffs’ claims against Gregory Hebert and GE Money Bank remain pending at the time of this appeal.', '-3- Superior Court on March 12, 2012. At this hearing, defense counsel argued that the Pelletiers had no duty to the decedent as social hosts, nor did any special relationship exist between the Pelletiers and Ashley that would impose upon them a duty to protect her from harm caused by a third party. In response, plaintiffs’ counsel argued that the claims against the Pelletiers were not based upon social host liability, but rather upon principles of premises liability. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that the Pelletiers allowed a dangerous instrumentality to be used on the premises, which resulted in injury to the decedent.', 'Concluding that no duty arose under principles of premises liability, the Superior Court justice stated, “I cannot see extending the duty of a property owner to the situation where a person is injured off the property as a result of something other than a defect in the property. * * * [A]s a matter of law, I can’t find the [decedent] getting on the vehicle as a defect in the property that gives rise to the duty.” The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of the Pelletiers.

Bowen’s Landing Corp., 522 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 1987), for the proposition that a duty of care should have been recognized based on the facts of this case. Although plaintiffs contend that principles of social host liability do not apply in this case, they argue that the Pelletiers owed a duty of reasonable care for the safety of their guests—including the decedent—who were on the premises as guests at the graduation party. The plaintiffs contend that this duty is evidenced by the fact that the Pelletiers witnessed Hebert providing ATV rides on their property, yet failed to take any measures to prevent what they knew was an unsafe practice.', 'It is well settled that “[t]o properly set forth ‘a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.’” Brown v.

Id. at 704.', 'On appeal, we reversed the trial justice’s ruling and held that although “each possessor of land owes to those outside the premises a duty to use reasonable care to prevent them from being injured as a result of activities on their property * * * [t]his duty extends to activities conducted by third parties on the possessor’s property if the possessor has the power to control such activities.” Volpe, 821 A.2d at 705 (citing W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 57 at 387, 392 (5th ed. 1984)) (emphasis added). We specified that, in order for this duty to arise, however, the landowner must “(1) know or have reason to know that they have', '-7- the ability to control the person(s) using their land, and (2) know or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.”', 'Id. at 706 (citing Restatement (Second) Torts § 318 at 127). We also clarified that this legal principle “does not create strict liability for those possessors of property who permit third parties to conduct an activity on their property that creates an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to others, even in situations when, as [in Volpe], the possessor and the third-party user are related to one another.” Id. After this Court determined that sufficient evidence had been presented for a jury to conclude that both of the conditions to the rule were met based on the facts of Volpe, we “caution[ed] against any hasty extrapolation of the legal principles discussed in this opinion to different factual scenarios.” Id. at 718.', 'Two years after Volpe, this Court decided Martin, 871 A.2d at 914, a social host and premises liability action in which an underage guest was attacked during a party at the defendant’s home where alcohol was being served to minors. In Martin, we reiterated the general rule that “a landowner has no duty to protect another from harm caused by the dangerous or illegal acts of a third party.” Id. at 915 (citing Luoni v. Berube, 729 N.E.2d 1108, 1111 (Mass. 2000)). We noted that “[a]n exception to this rule exists, however, when a plaintiff and a defendant bear a special relationship to each other.” Id. Accordingly, this Court determined that a special relationship existed where an adult provided intoxicating beverages to underage partygoers so as to impose a duty upon the landowner to take reasonable steps to protect their guests from injury. Id. at 916.', 'After scrutinizing the facts of the case at bar against our existing case law, we decline to create the duty requested by plaintiffs. The facts of this case are readily distinguishable from those which led to our holding in Volpe.', 'Here, we are not faced with a scenario where something emanating from the property—like the shotgun blasts in Volpe—caused harm to an', '-8- innocent and unknowing third party who was in close proximity to, yet still outside, the property. In fact, we specified that our analysis in Volpe would likely have been different if the mentally ill son had traveled from the defendant’s property to commit his heinous act. Volpe, 821 A.2d at 713 (“Unfortunately, [the] defendant’s house functioned as this mentally disturbed murderer’s convenient armory and sanctuary from which he readily could emerge and to which he readily could retreat after acting on whatever compulsion, delusion, or hallucination propelled him into causing this victim’s death.”). Moreover, although plaintiffs do not allege strict liability, we note that the mere presence of Hebert’s ATV does not create an inherently dangerous condition upon the Pelletiers’ property under principles of premises liability.', 'We are also satisfied that, based on the facts of this case, there is no indication that the Pelletiers had the ability to control Hebert’s actions so as to prevent injury to Ashley. Although we in no way mean to diminish the tragic outcome of these facts, it is nonetheless undisputed that the adult Ashley requested a ride from Hebert—who was also an adult—then voluntarily mounted the ATV, and, after declining the offer of a helmet, drove off the Pelletiers’ property with Hebert. No special relationship existed between the Pelletiers and Ashley that would require them to protect her, nor did the Pelletiers have the legal ability to control either Ashley’s or Hebert’s actions either on or off the premises.', 'Additionally, we note that the scope and burden of the obligation that the plaintiffs ask to be imposed upon the defendants is practically insurmountable and contrary to public policy. Imposing such a duty would cause landowners to face liability in seemingly innocuous, yet—in retrospect—“dangerous” situations. Accordingly, despite the tragic facts present in this case, “[i]t is not the function of this Court to declare a duty when none exists.” Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1048 (R.I. 2010).', '-9-', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

14,Javier Merida : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In this appeal, we review the denial of an application for postconviction relief. Javier Merida (Merida or applicant) was convicted of two counts of first-degree child molestation and one count of second-degree child molestation. We affirmed those convictions in his direct appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 240 (R.I. 2008). Merida then applied for postconviction relief, arguing that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. Merida’s application for postconviction relief was denied. The applicant sought review by this Court, and both parties appeared pursuant to an order directing them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be decided summarily. We are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we affirm the denial of the application for postconviction relief.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court thoroughly recounted the facts as borne out by the trial testimony in our consideration of applicant’s direct appeal. See Merida, 960 A.2d at 230-34. Therefore, we only recount facts salient to this appeal and other facts as necessary for context.', '-1-', 'During the May 2006 trial, the complainant, Betsy, 1 testified that Merida—her paternal grandfather—repeatedly molested her when she was between the ages of seven and ten years. Merida, 960 A.2d at 230-31. She testified that the molestations occurred during weekends spent with her paternal grandparents, but when her paternal grandmother was not home. Id. at 231. Specifically, Betsy testified to one instance of breast grabbing, one instance of digital-vaginal penetration, and three instances of vaginal intercourse; however, the testimony of a third instance of vaginal intercourse was unexpected. Id.', 'Merida’s niece by marriage, Lisa, also testified at trial. Merida, 960 A.2d at 233. Lisa testified that, when she was five to ten years old, Merida molested her when she was alone with him. Id. The trial justice permitted this testimony over objection by trial counsel, who argued that the evidence should have been excluded under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Merida, 960 A.2d at 232. Although Lisa was the first witness to testify for the state, Merida’s trial counsel did not object to the order in which the state presented the witnesses. Id. at 233.', 'Ultimately, the jury convicted Merida of two counts of first-degree child molestation and one count of second-degree child molestation; Merida was acquitted of a third count of first- degree child molestation. We affirmed his convictions on his direct appeal. Merida, 960 A.2d at 240. Merida then brought this application for postconviction relief on February 13, 2009, arguing that his trial counsel’s performance amounted to ineffective assistance. The Superior Court justice who also presided over Merida’s trial took evidence and heard argument regarding 1', 'We adopt the pseudonyms used in our opinion on the direct appeal.', '-2- the application.2 In a written decision, the trial justice recounted the relevant evidence and assessed the credibility of both trial counsel and applicant. The trial justice found that applicant failed to establish that trial counsel’s performance was deficient, and she therefore denied the application.', 'Standard of Review', '“The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1 is ‘available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.’” Hall v. State, 60 A.3d 928, 931 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 1016 (R.I. 2008)). “When passing on an application for postconviction relief, this Court accords great deference to the factual determinations of the Superior Court hearing justice.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011) (citing Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 313 (R.I. 2009)). Accordingly, this Court “will uphold a postconviction relief decision absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 313. However, “[w]hen a postconviction relief decision involves ‘questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights[,]’ we review those issues de novo.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610 (quoting Hazard v. State, 968 A.2d 886, 891 (R.I. 2009)). “[F]indings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, will still be accorded great deference by this Court, even when a de novo standard is applied to the issues 2', 'The application for postconviction relief was heard together with a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The trial justice denied the motion for a new trial, and Merida appealed; however, the appeal was later withdrawn.', '-3- of constitutional dimension.” Hazard, 968 A.2d at 891 (quoting Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 85 (R.I. 2007)).', 'This Court evaluates a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the criteria set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Linde v. State, 78 A.3d 738, 745 (R.I. 2013). “First, the applicant must establish that counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient; [t]his requires [a] showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed * * * by the Sixth Amendment.” Linde, 78 A.3d at 745 (quoting Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 110-11 (R.I. 2012)). This review is highly deferential, and we afford counsel “a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.” Id. (quoting Bido, 56 A.3d at 111). “Only if it is determined that trial counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient does the Court proceed to the second prong of the Strickland test, in which the applicant must show that the ‘deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.’” Id. at 745-46 (quoting Guerrero v. State, 47 A.3d 289, 300-01 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Analysis', 'The only issue properly before this Court is whether applicant was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.3 The applicant presents a myriad of reasons for his claim. They are discussed seriatim. 3', 'Whether the trial justice erred in admitting evidence under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence is not properly before this Court in this application for postconviction relief. In applicant’s direct appeal, we held that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in admitting Lisa’s testimony. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 239 (R.I. 2008). Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata bars the relitigation of this issue, despite appellate counsel’s attempt to breathe', '-4-', 'The applicant contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate, call witnesses, or properly cross-examine witnesses about the complainant’s motive to lie. This argument focuses on allegations of tension that existed between Betsy’s maternal grandmother, Donna, and the Merida family that arose at the time the complainant was born. According to trial counsel, the defense’s theory at trial was that her grandmother pressured Betsy into making the allegations against Merida. Although trial counsel acknowledged that he was aware of the animosity between the families at the time of Betsy’s birth, he contends that the Merida family never told him “why [Donna] wanted to see Javier Merida prosecuted for child molestation.”', 'The applicant testified at the hearing and averred that he provided trial counsel with the details of an ongoing inter-familial conflict—in particular, issues regarding Betsy’s custody, changing her last name, and changing her health insurance—and that he asked trial counsel to hire an investigator to explore the family dynamics. Trial counsel, however, testified that he did not recall any discussion with the Merida family about changes to Betsy’s custody, last name, or health insurance. The trial justice found trial counsel’s version of the discussions with his client to be “highly credible” and based on both his memory and his detailed notes. Conversely, she found that Merida’s version lacked credibility. Accordingly, the trial justice was satisfied that trial counsel adequately explored any motives Betsy may have had to fabricate her testimony.', 'Before this Court, applicant asserts that trial counsel’s actions were not a “reasonable exercise of strategy.” However, this argument is largely predicated upon Merida’s version of events, which the trial justice found to be not credible. This Court defers to a trial justice’s findings on credibility.', 'See Doctor v. State, 865 A.2d 1064, 1068 n.5 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]n new life into it. See Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003) (“Res judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with them.”).', '-5- reviewing an application for postconviction relief, we defer to the trial justice’s findings on credibility unless clearly wrong.”). Accepting trial counsel’s version—that he did not know the specifics of the ongoing animosity between the families—we agree with the trial justice that it was reasonable for trial counsel to not pursue it any further. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 17 n.11 (R.I. 2012) (“We note that ‘[o]n review of an application for post-conviction relief we are bound by the trial justice’s determination concerning credibility.’”) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980)). An attorney cannot pursue a potential defense if he or she is unaware of the specifics of that defense. Furthermore, the record discloses that trial counsel examined Betsy for any potential influence by Donna, and he argued that issue to the jury. Therefore, trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient with respect to the complainant’s motive to lie.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a medical expert to rebut the testimony of Dr. Christine Barron (Dr. Barron). Doctor Barron examined Betsy after she disclosed Merida’s abuse. Testifying during the state’s case-in-chief, Dr. Barron testified that the results of Betsy’s examination were normal. When asked whether a normal examination may nonetheless be consistent with allegations of vaginal penetration, Dr. Barron stated that “[a] normal examination neither rules out nor confirms the possibility of sexual abuse or prior penetration.”', 'The applicant attempts to assign constitutional deficiency to his trial counsel’s failure to call a medical expert to rebut Dr. Barron’s opinion. However, there was nothing for applicant to rebut. Doctor Barron’s conclusion was equivocal: her testimony did not indicate that Betsy was sexually abused (much less, sexually abused by Merida). Furthermore, trial counsel did engage an expert, Dr. Patricia Crane (Dr. Crane), to review the records of Betsy’s examination.', '-6- Although the record discloses that Dr. Crane requested additional information and trial counsel did not comply with that request, her evaluation of the medical records she did review similarly was equivocal. She stated that (1) “Any expert, defense or prosecution[,] would have to say that there is always the possibility of no physical injuries”; (2) the hymen “may remain with smooth retracted edges after digital penetration”; (3) “No one would be able to say for sure if the notch is related to a past tear in the tissue or if it is a normal variation”; and (4) “With no definitive clinical findings, as in this case, there is no way to say for sure who did what [and] when, unless the child has a sexually transmitted disease.” (Emphases added.) Thus, Dr. Crane’s opinion was consistent with Dr. Barron’s opinion. Because Dr. Barron’s conclusion was equivocal and because the expert advice that trial counsel received did not contradict it, trial counsel’s performance was not constitutionally deficient based on his decision to not present a medical expert to testify.', 'See Linde, 78 A.3d at 745 (noting strong presumption that counsel’s performance was in the permissible range of assistance).', 'Finally, regarding the medical testimony, applicant asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for his failure to request a continuance to review an article referenced by Dr. Barron during her testimony.', 'Trial counsel testified that it would have prolonged Dr. Barron’s testimony and would have had little impact in light of her previously stated medical opinion. The trial justice agreed and found trial counsel’s decision to be a reasonable strategic decision. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in concluding that this was a reasonable tactical decision, particularly in light of the fact that Dr. Barron’s testimony on the issue was equivocal.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he prevented applicant from testifying in his own defense. Merida did not testify at trial, but his version of the events leading to this decision varied greatly from that of counsel. Trial counsel testified that he', '-7- discussed the pros and cons of testifying with his client. In fact, he conducted a mock exercise consisting of both direct and cross-examination with Merida and told him that it went well. However, after the conclusion of the state’s case, trial counsel testified that he recommended Merida not testify because trial counsel thought he had established a reasonable doubt defense, and, if Merida testified, the case would turn into a credibility contest for the jury, and not whether there was reasonable doubt. Trial counsel testified that he thought a great deal about this recommendation and consulted another veteran defense attorney regarding this decision. Trial counsel testified that he did not recall Merida telling him that he wanted to take the stand; he testified that Merida concurred with his recommendation. Merida, on the other hand, testified that trial counsel knew that he wanted to testify, and that Merida left the mock examination session with the impression that he would testify the next day. According to Merida, he was surprised when trial counsel did not call him to testify.', 'The trial justice found trial counsel’s testimony on this issue more credible than applicant’s testimony. Furthermore, the Court found that Merida and trial counsel discussed the issue and that Merida “knowingly and voluntarily accepted [trial counsel’s] recommendation that he not testify.” We defer to the trial justice’s ruling on this point. See Doctor, 865 A.2d at 1067. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s finding—that it was a reasonable strategic decision for trial counsel to recommend that Merida not testify—also is supported by the evidence and is not clearly wrong. See id.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to properly cross-examine Lisa and neglected to object to the state’s order of proof at trial. The indictment against Merida charged him with abusing both Betsy and Lisa; the first trial ended in a mistrial because Lisa did not appear to testify, and the charges against Merida pertaining to', '-8- Lisa’s allegations were dismissed. The applicant contends that trial counsel was deficient by not examining Lisa about her failure to appear at the first trial. Trial counsel, however, testified that he did not do so because it would highlight to the jury that a grand jury had indicted Merida on separate counts concerning Lisa as well as Betsy and that information could result in prejudice to Merida. Regarding his failure to object to the order of witnesses, trial counsel testified that he considered the order of proof to be immaterial because he had solid grounds for effective cross- examination of Lisa. The trial justice found this decision to be a reasonable and strategic one. Clearly, vigorous examination of Lisa, another putative victim, was a risky undertaking, and reference to an additional indictment would have exacerbated the impact of Lisa’s testimony. Because trial counsel believed that he had better cross-examination material against Lisa and that the order in which the evidence was presented was of no moment, his decision not to object to the order of witnesses was a reasonable tactical decision.', 'Finally, the applicant stated in his initial Rule 12A statement that he wished to assert seven additional grounds for postconviction relief on appeal that were raised below and articulated in an exhibit attached to his memorandum. Although these issues were raised in the Superior Court, they were not argued in any detail nor were they addressed by the trial justice. Additionally, the Rule 12A statements themselves contain no argument on these issues. Therefore, these issues are waived.4 Kaveny v. Town of Cumberland Zoning Board of Review, 875 A.2d 1, 10 (R.I. 2005) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the 4', 'Although we deem these issues waived, we note that they were raised in the Superior Court— purportedly to preserve Merida’s rights in federal court—and the trial justice permitted the relevant portion of applicant’s written memoranda to be submitted as a full exhibit.

15,": v. : William Walmsley et al. : v. : Tapco, Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The genesis of this appeal is a tragic automobile collision that claimed the lives of two young men and the resulting action for wrongful death. Before the Supreme Court are Maureen O’Connell and Paul Roberti (plaintiffs), in their capacities as co-administrators of the Estate of Brendan M. O’Connell Roberti, seeking review of a Superior Court order that granted the defendant William Walmsley’s motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The tragic facts of this case emanate from a horrific automobile collision that occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, March 9, 2003, in the Town of Coventry, Rhode Island. Earlier that evening, a group of young friends, Brendan O’Connell Roberti (Roberti or decedent), Jason Goffe (Goffe), Michael Petrarca (Petrarca), Frank Paolantonio, Jr. (Paolantonio), Erin', '-1- Grant (Grant), and Derek Zisk (Zisk) met at Shooters, a pool hall and bar located on Cowesett Avenue in West Warwick. The friends remained there for a few hours, playing pool and enjoying a few rounds of drinks; at around 10 p.m., they decided to depart and travel to Zisk’s house, located off of New London Turnpike in Coventry.', 'The group left the pool hall in three separate vehicles.', 'Petrarca, who drove a commercial Ford F350 truck with Paolantonio as his passenger, turned left out of the parking lot onto Cowesett Avenue. Goffe followed in his Toyota Corolla, accompanied by Roberti in the passenger seat. Finally, Grant, traveling with Zisk, drove the last vehicle out of the parking lot, and remained—at all times—behind the other vehicles.', 'According to the occupants of Petrarca’s truck, moments after leaving the Shooters parking lot, Goffe increased his speed, crossed the center line of the two-lane road, and passed the truck on the left. The Toyota then returned to the correct lane of travel and continued traveling at a speed of between forty and fifty miles per hour to the end of Cowesett Avenue; both vehicles then turned left onto Main Street and continued toward New London Turnpike, with Goffe’s Toyota still ahead of the truck. After traveling approximately one-half mile, the vehicles were required to turn left and proceed around a triangular median, in order to access New London Turnpike. Petrarca avoided this route, however, by making an illegal turn onto a one-way street and passing the Toyota on the left, thereby regaining the lead as Goffe made a legal left turn onto New London Turnpike. Petrarca testified that he made this fateful maneuver “as a joke,” however, he agreed that at this point, “it was getting a little crazy.”', 'The vehicles continued west on New London Turnpike into Coventry; the road was straight with intermittent hills and dips. Although Grant continued to follow the Petrarca and Goffe vehicles, she testified that when she realized that she was traveling at about fifty miles per', '-2- hour, she slowed down and saw the other vehicles speed away. According to Grant, it appeared that the two cars were racing because “they were about even with each other driving [in] the same direction,” with Goffe’s vehicle on the left side of Petrarca’s truck, facing oncoming traffic. A dip in the road caused Grant to momentarily lose sight of the two vehicles; however, when they reappeared she saw headlights approaching from the opposite direction and watched as Goffe’s vehicle swerved into the westbound lane in front of Petrarca’s truck.', 'Petrarca testified that he was traveling around fifty miles per hour in the westbound lane when he looked out the driver’s side window and saw Goffe’s vehicle alongside his truck, traveling in the eastbound lane. His passenger, Paolantonio, saw headlights approaching from the opposite direction, “probably a lot more than” 500 to 800 feet away. He advised Petrarca to slow down. Petrarca complied and allowed the Toyota to pass; however, according to Petrarca, Goffe passed him “like I was standing still”; he estimated Goffe’s speed to be around seventy miles per hour. Petrarca testified that Goffe’s vehicle re-entered the westbound lane a few seconds later, at which point Petrarca first noticed the headlights of a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction. Petrarca saw the Toyota’s brakes applied momentarily before the car “sh[ot] right back into the oncoming traffic lane” at an angle, as if the car was turning left.', 'Paolantonio testified that the Toyota “was already on an angle” when it re-entered the westbound lane and that after Goffe passed his truck, he “never had control of the vehicle.” According to Paolantonio, the distance between Goffe’s vehicle and the approaching headlights was “a lot more than” 300 feet when the Toyota began to spin out of control. Goffe’s vehicle then turned into the opposite, eastbound lane at a 180-degree angle when the front end of a vehicle driven by William Walmsley (Walmsley or defendant) collided with the passenger side of the Toyota. Neither Petrarca nor Paolantonio saw Walmsley brake or slow down, leave his', '-3- lane of travel, or otherwise make any attempt to avoid the accident. Significantly, Paolantonio testified that Walmsley “probably could have braked * * * because he could have seen [Goffe] spinning out of control long before that.”', 'As a result of the accident, twenty-year-old Goffe1 and twenty-two-year-old Roberti2 were pronounced dead at the scene. Walmsley and his passenger, Brenda Chandler (Chandler)— who was Walmsley’s fiancée at the time, and who had fallen asleep before the collision—were both seriously injured and taken to the hospital. There, Walmsley’s blood was drawn, revealing a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit. Walmsley later testified that, at the time of the collision, he and Chandler were returning home from the Mohegan Sun Casino (casino), where they had spent the afternoon eating, drinking, and gambling. Walmsley testified that he had consumed between two and five beers at the casino, but denied that he was in any way impaired by alcohol consumption. Walmsley estimated that he was traveling thirty-five miles per hour and stated that the last thing he remembered was traveling down a hill.3 Although Walmsley testified that at no point was his view of the road obstructed, he admitted that he did not see Goffe’s vehicle or any other headlights before the collision, nor did he apply his brakes or take any evasive action to avoid the accident.', 'On February 28, 2005, Roberti’s parents, Maureen O’Connell and Paul Roberti (plaintiffs), in their capacities as co-administrators of the Estate of Brendan M. O’Connell Roberti, filed suit against Walmsley, Geico General Insurance Company (Geico)—the insurer of 1', 'In addition to the injuries sustained in the accident, the medical examiner indicated that acute ethanol intoxication also contributed to Goffe’s death. 2', 'At the time of his death, Roberti was just four days shy of his twenty-third birthday. 3', 'When questioned about the moments leading up to the accident, Walmsley testified that “[f]rom the forced trauma of the impact, I believe my recollection minutes before the accident is not in my memory.”', '-4- the Goffe vehicle—and Donald R. Goffe, Jason Goffe’s father and the owner of the Toyota.4 After a series of settlements and negotiated releases, the case proceeded to trial with Walmsley as the sole defendant.', 'A jury trial commenced on June 21, 2010, and continued over the course of ten days. The plaintiffs presented several witnesses, including Walmsley, Chandler, two accident reconstruction experts, a toxicology expert, and an economist. The first accident reconstruction expert, retired Coventry Police Det. Paul Koczwanski (Det. Koczwanski), testified that he was called to the scene of the accident shortly after it occurred. He stated that the posted speed limit on New London Turnpike was twenty-five miles per hour, and the contour of the roadway leading up to the point of collision was straight but hilly, with intermittent dips in the road. He testified that, although there were no skid marks at the scene, there were yaw marks— impressions on the roadway left by tires when a vehicle is in the process of turning—which indicated that Goffe had over-steered or sharply turned the vehicle, possibly in an attempt to compensate for a previous maneuver or to regain control of the car.', 'Based on his investigation, Det. Koczwanski estimated that Goffe’s vehicle was not driving seventy miles per hour as Petrarca had testified, but that the Toyota “was traveling 4', 'Walmsley answered the complaint and filed a cross-claim for contribution and indemnification against Geico, claiming that, if he was found liable, it would be due to the negligence of Goffe. Geico then filed a counterclaim and third-party interpleader complaint, naming Walmsley and Chandler as third-party defendants. In this filing, Geico requested that it be allowed to tender the limits of Goffe’s liability policy, to be distributed on a pro rata basis to Roberti’s estate, Walmsley, and Chandler. A consent order was entered on February 17, 2006, indicating that Geico had tendered the policy limits, distributing $300,000 to the claimants, and that all claims against Geico and Donald Goffe—including cross-claims for indemnity and contribution—were dismissed with prejudice. Walmsley then filed a third-party complaint for indemnification and contribution against Petrarca—the driver of the truck that was allegedly racing with the Toyota on the night of the accident—and Tapco, Inc., the owner of the truck that Petrarca was driving. The plaintiffs, however, later executed a “Joint Tortfeasor Release and Indemnity Agreement” as to Petrarca, Tapco, and their insurance company, Employers Mutual Casualty Company, in June 2007.', '-5- significantly over the [25 m.p.h.] speed limit at the time of impact.” He also estimated that Walmsley’s car was traveling at around forty miles per hour at the time of the accident. According to Det. Koczwanski, the primary cause of the crash was Goffe’s Toyota entering Walmsley’s lane of travel, with the speed of both vehicles contributing to the collision. Detective Koczwanski opined that, based on his investigation, Walmsley did not have time to avoid the accident.5', 'According to Donald Mong (Mr. Mong)—plaintiffs’ second accident reconstruction expert—the average motorist driving at night would require two and a half seconds to perceive a hazard and react; however, there was “no indication at all of any evasive action taken” by Walmsley to avoid the accident. Based on his investigation of the accident, Mr. Mong concluded that three dominant factors contributed to the accident: namely, the Toyota entering Walmsley’s lane of travel, the speed of the two vehicles, and Goffe’s failure to maintain control of the Toyota. According to Mr. Mong, the accident would not have occurred absent one of these three events.', 'The toxicology expert, Prof. Dennis Hilliard (Prof. Hilliard), the Director of the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory, testified that Walmsley’s blood alcohol level was approximately .106 percent when he was tested at the hospital after the collision. Professor Hilliard estimated that at the time of the collision—approximately forty-five minutes before his blood was tested— Walmsley’s blood alcohol level would have been .117 percent, with a range from .107 to .124, depending upon the rate at which Walmsley’s body metabolized alcohol. Professor Hilliard estimated that, based on Walmsley’s testimony concerning his activities and time spent at the 5', 'Detective Koczwanski also testified that he observed a tire mark in the sand, which he believed could have been caused by Walmsley attempting to avoid the collision. He subsequently admitted, however, that this detail was not noted in his accident report.', '-6- casino, Walmsley would have consumed between ten and twelve beers in order to reach the blood alcohol level registered at the time his blood was tested.', 'He further opined that Walmsley’s reaction time and ability to safely operate a motor vehicle were impaired to a significant degree.', 'At the close of plaintiffs’ case, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law on causation grounds, arguing that plaintiffs had failed to prove that, but for the negligence of defendant, the accident would not have occurred. The trial justice reserved decision and allowed the case to go to the jury, but declared that this was “a very unique negligence case,” and that “it will be a difficult case for this jury to decide because there is an enormous amount of conflicting evidence.”6', 'The jury found that Walmsley was negligent and that his negligence was a proximate cause of Roberti’s death. The jury then addressed the issue of comparative negligence and assigned fault to each driver as follows: Walmsley, 3 percent; Goffe, 94 percent; and Petrarca, 3 percent. The jury also determined that the total amount of damages sustained by the estate, without adjusting for percentages of liability, was $10,000.', 'After the jury verdict, defendant renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law, and plaintiffs moved for a new trial and an additur. The trial justice granted defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, finding that there was no evidence presented tending to establish that defendant’s operation of his vehicle was a proximate cause of the collision. The trial justice then proceeded to address plaintiffs’ motions, reasoning that in the event that judgment as a matter of law was overturned on appeal, plaintiffs’ motion for an additur to $250,000—the statutory minimum for wrongful death cases under G.L. 1956 § 10-7-2—would be granted. Alternatively, the trial justice ruled that, if plaintiffs did not accept the additur, their motion for a 6', 'At the close of evidence, defendant sought to renew the motion for judgment as a matter of law; the trial justice, however, stated that he would again reserve decision on the motion.', '-7- new trial on both liability and damages would be granted.7 Judgment was entered in favor of defendant on September 22, 2010; plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” McGarry v.

In Oddo, the plaintiffs were passengers in a vehicle operated by the defendant, when suddenly a vehicle traveling from the opposite direction swerved out of control, crossed the center line, and collided with the defendant’s vehicle. Id. The defendant claimed that her motion for a directed verdict should have been granted because she was under no duty to anticipate that the oncoming vehicle would cross the center line. Id. at 580, 218 A.2d at 374. Although we agreed with that broad principle, and noted that “[i]t is true that the operator of a motor vehicle is under no duty to anticipate that the operator of a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction may suddenly turn and cross over to the side of the highway upon which he is operating,” id., we also held that, because conflicting testimony was presented showing that the oncoming vehicle began to spin across the highway while the defendant’s vehicle was still about 600 feet away—or some five to seven seconds before the collision—the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict was properly denied because a question of fact arose as to whether the defendant was exercising due care as the oncoming vehicle was spinning across the highway. Id. at 581, 218 A.2d at 375.', 'In this case, in passing on defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the trial justice recounted the testimony provided by Walmsley, Grant, Petrarca, and Paolantonio, as well as the expert testimony provided by Prof. Hilliard, Det. Koczwanski, and Mr. Mong. The trial justice found that there was “insufficient or [a] complete absence of evidence that would permit this jury to apportion any liability to the defendant.” Specifically, the trial justice determined that there was an “absence of testimony or physical evidence that establishes where operator Goffe’s vehicle initially entered the eastbound lane of the defendant prior to impact,” and “no', '- 10 - evidence as to where defendant’s vehicle was located at the moment the Goffe vehicle entered the eastbound lane of travel either by distance or by roadway reference points.” Without this evidence, the trial justice explained, “there is no evidentiary foundation upon which a reasonable juror could conclude that as a result of defendant’s intoxication and excessive speed * * * that there was a sufficient period [or] distance and opportunity for this defendant to brake or take any evasive action prior to impact.” According to the trial justice, the “[t]hree percent finding of the jury [was] not based on facts in evidence but rather is pure speculation.” We disagree with this conclusion.', 'When viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor, it is clear that a reasonable jury could assign liability to defendant. It is undisputed that Walmsley was driving in excess of the speed limit, was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision, and did not see the Goffe vehicle or any other vehicle at any point before the impact.', 'Although Walmsley testified that his view of the road was unobstructed and that he did not believe he was impaired, Prof. Hilliard testified that Walmsley’s blood alcohol level would significantly impair his perception and reaction time. Additionally, the conflicting testimony provided by Petrarca, Paolantonio, and Grant created a jury question as to whether, in the exercise of due caution, Walmsley should have seen Goffe’s vehicle and the oncoming headlights of the other vehicles and taken action to avoid the collision, when the Toyota was traveling alongside Petrarca’s truck or when it began spinning out of control, entering the eastbound lane before the impact. See Oddo, 100 R.I. at 581, 218 A.2d at 375.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that sufficient evidence was presented in this case establishing intoxication, speed, and an inference of inattention or diminished reaction time on the part of the defendant from which the jury could infer negligence and conclude that', '- 11 - Walmsley’s failure to react was a contributing factor resulting in Roberti’s death. In our opinion, the trial justice placed far too much emphasis on the lack of evidence—by way of distance or roadway reference points—of the precise location where Goffe’s vehicle entered into Walmsley’s lane of travel.8 The fact that no witness was able to establish this point on the roadway is not fatal to the plaintiffs’ case, in light of the other evidence presented. Thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice overlooked the evidence that was produced in this case, including the undisputed fact that Walmsley failed to apply his brakes before the collision. In doing so, the trial justice weighed the evidence, and exceeded his authority under Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 8', 'The record reflects that at multiple points during the presentation of witness testimony—and again during his ruling on the defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law—the trial justice expressed his opinion that the lack of measurements and roadway reference points negatively impacted plaintiffs’ case. For instance, when plaintiffs’ counsel asked Det. Koczwanski if, at any point prior to the collision Walmsley could have seen Petrarca and Goffe approaching, the trial justice sustained defense counsel’s objection, stating:', '“What I’m concerned about in this case is that no one has introduced a diagram of', 'this roadway with distances, widths or landmarks or anything else that would', 'have been helpful. * * * If we had that and directed [Det.

16,State : v. : Michael Patino. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. On April 2, 2010, Michael Patino (defendant) was indicted for the first-degree murder of Marco Nieves, the six-year-old son of his girlfriend, Trisha Oliver. The state’s case against the defendant was constructed largely on the basis of incriminating text messages purportedly sent by the defendant to Ms. Oliver, messages which were discovered on her cell phone by officers of the Cranston Police Department. The defendant filed a number of pretrial motions seeking to suppress the bulk of the evidence that the state intended to use against him. After a month-long series of evidentiary hearings, the hearing justice rendered a comprehensive and thoughtful one-hundred-ninety page written decision. Holding that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, she granted all but one of the motions to suppress. In addition, she found that the defendant had made a preliminary showing that “numerous sworn statements made by police officers in a dozen warrant affidavits were either deliberately false or made in reckless disregard of the truth,” thereby entitling the defendant to a Franks 1 hearing. 1', 'Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978).', '-1-', 'The attorney general, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-32, 2 appealed from the Superior Court order, arguing that: (1) defendant lacks standing to contest the lawfulness of the search of Trisha Oliver’s cell phone; (2) defendant does not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in sent text messages; (3) defendant has no standing to make a Franks challenge; and (4) even with the removal of the materials identified by the hearing justice, the relevant affidavits were sufficient to establish probable cause. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Initial Investigation', 'On October 4, 2009, at approximately 6:08 a.m., Trisha Oliver placed a 9-1-1 call from her Cranston apartment indicating that her six-year-old son was unresponsive and not breathing. At approximately 6:15 a.m., Cranston Rescue and Fire Department responded to the apartment and, within minutes, transported Marco to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence. The rescue personnel arrived at the hospital with Marco shortly after 6:30 a.m.', 'Meanwhile, members of the Cranston Police Department arrived at the apartment to begin an investigation. Sergeant Matthew Kite arrived at the apartment at approximately 6:20 a.m. and spoke briefly with Officer Aldrich, who was leaving the scene to escort the ambulance 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-24-32 provides, in pertinent part:', '“In a criminal proceeding, the attorney general shall have', 'the right to object to any finding, ruling, decision, order, or', 'judgment of the superior court or family court, and the attorney', 'general may appeal the findings, rulings, decisions, orders, or', 'judgments to the supreme court at any time before the defendant', 'has been placed in jeopardy * * * .”', '-2- to the hospital. Sergeant Kite then met outside the apartment with Officers Carroll and Lee, as well as Trisha Oliver. Oliver then escorted Sgt. Kite into her apartment so she could show him Marco’s bedroom and other areas of the apartment that he deemed relevant to the investigation of Marco’s condition.', 'Once in the apartment, Sgt. Kite observed Oliver’s boyfriend, defendant Michael Patino, sitting on the couch with the couple’s fourteen-month-old daughter, Jazlyn.', 'Ms. Oliver proceeded to show Sgt. Kite around the apartment to survey the remnants of Marco’s illness. They first passed through the dining room and living room to Marco’s bedroom, where Sgt. Kite observed a stripped bed and linens on the floor. They continued on to the master bedroom and viewed another stripped bed, as well as a trash can that Marco had used as a vomit receptacle. Finally, she showed him the bathroom, where Sgt. Kite observed dark brown vomit in the toilet, which he described as having the appearance of “coffee ground[s].” They then returned to the entrance of the apartment; Officer Carroll transported Oliver to the hospital shortly thereafter.', 'Although Sgt. Kite testified that he did not at that point consider the apartment to be a crime scene, he nevertheless requested that Officer Lee start a crime scene roster to document who entered and exited the apartment. After Oliver had been transported to the hospital, Sgt. Kite remained at the apartment to look for potentially hazardous materials that could have caused Marco’s illness. It was at this point that Sgt. Kite observed four different cellular telephones, the contents of which would largely form the basis of the state’s case against defendant and the issues on appeal before this Court. Sergeant Kite observed an LG Verizon cell phone (LG phone) on the kitchen counter; a Metro PCS Kyocera cell phone (Metro PCS phone) on the dining room table; a T-Mobile Sidekick cell phone (T-Mobile phone) on the headrest of the couch behind defendant; and an iPhone (iPhone) on the armrest of the couch.', '-3-', 'Sergeant Kite then spoke with defendant, who agreed to accompany Sgt. Kite to the Cranston police headquarters to make a statement about what had transpired that morning. At the suppression hearing, Sgt. Kite testified that he asked defendant what had happened the previous night, but defendant indicated that he had not been there the previous night and did not know. Sergeant Kite also testified that he inquired of defendant the time at which Oliver had called him to come over, to which defendant responded that she had not called him because he does not own a cell phone, and that he had arrived at the apartment early that morning, by chance.', 'Sergeant Kite testified that, shortly after this interaction with defendant, he noticed that the LG cell phone on the kitchen counter “indicated audibly and by light that it was receiving a message.” In response, Sgt. Kite went over to the phone and picked it up, checking to see if it was Marco’s father or someone else calling regarding Marco’s condition. Sergeant Kite testified that he picked up the phone and viewed an alert on the front screen of the phone indicating that there was one new message, at which point he opened the phone to view the interior screen. The interior screen indicated that there was a new message, but that the message could not be received due to a lack of credit on the phone account. In an effort to acknowledge receipt of the message and thereby avoid repeat notifications, Sgt. Kite testified that he “manipulated the button” on the phone, which led to a mailbox listing incoming and outgoing text messages. Sergeant Kite testified that, upon seeing the word “hospital” in a text message, he clicked the phone to view the following message in the “outbox” folder: 3 “wat if I got2 take him 2 da [hospital] wat will I say and dos marks on his neck omg.” The message was addressed to 3', 'Critically, although this message was stored in the “outbox” folder, the phone indicated that the message was “saved” in the “outbox” and, due to a lack of funds on Oliver’s phone, was never actually delivered.', '-4- “DAMASTER” at phone number (401) xxx-xx80; a subsequent investigation revealed that “DAMASTER,” the intended recipient of the text message was, in fact, defendant.', 'Sergeant Kite testified that, although he found the message suspicious, he did not scroll through the phone any further, but instead placed the phone back on the counter and proceeded to call Lt. Sacoccia at headquarters to inform him of the curious text message. Sergeant Kite also informed Lt. Sacoccia that there would not be anyone to take care of Jazlyn while defendant was being interviewed, at which point Lt. Sacoccia consulted with the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and had an ambulance dispatched to pick up Jazlyn and transport her to the hospital “as a precaution.” The ambulance arrived and left with Jazlyn shortly thereafter.', 'At approximately 7:25 a.m., Officer Jeremy Machado escorted defendant to Cranston police headquarters, where they were met by Officer Ryan Shore. Officers Shore and Machado brought defendant to a conference room and directed him to empty his belongings onto a table. Among the belongings was the T-Mobile phone, which was confiscated immediately by Officer Machado. Shortly thereafter, Officer Machado escorted defendant upstairs to the detective division.', 'After defendant left the apartment, Sgt. Kite, who had remained on scene, noticed that the T-Mobile phone that had been on the headrest behind defendant was no longer there. Sergeant Kite testified that he immediately called headquarters about the missing phone and suggested that, “[t]here is possibly some information that needs to be protected on it and I just advised [Lt. Sacoccia] that you may want to take it off him when [Machado and defendant] arrived at headquarters.” Sergeant Kite then remained at the apartment until 10:15 a.m., during which time', '-5- Det. Wayne Cushman and Det. Peter Souza from the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) arrived.', 'There is considerable discrepancy about what occurred during the time that the officers remained at the apartment. The hearing justice found that the detectives received a call from Lt. Sacoccia informing them that a search warrant had been signed, at which time they began to photograph and videotape the scene, as well as gather and bag items for evidence. Sergeant Kite and Sgt. Cushman testified, however, that the detectives did not begin to photograph and bag evidence until after Sgt. Edward Walsh arrived with a hard copy of a signed search warrant. 4 In any event, among the items bagged for evidence was the LG phone, the contents of which had been previously photographed by Det. Cushman. Instead of securely sealing the phone, the BCI detectives placed it in a brown paper bag, which Sgt. Kite brought with him when he left the apartment. The bag with the phone was eventually returned to Det. Cushman at headquarters later that afternoon.', 'Photographs of the contents of the LG phone, which was later determined to be Oliver’s phone, reveal text messages that include not only vulgar and profane language, but also information inculpating defendant with respect to Marco’s injuries. 5 4', 'On cross-examination, after being impeached with his prior bail hearing testimony, Det. Cushman admitted that, prior to Sgt. Walsh arriving with the warrant he began photographing the text messages after being instructed over the phone by Sgt. Walsh to do so. 5', 'For example, on October 3, 2009, the following exchange of texts sent between Oliver’s LG phone and defendant’s T-Mobile phone occurred between approximately 4:48 p.m. and 5:57 p.m.:', '“Sent: of course he is gonna be all hurt and cryin cuz u fuckin beat', 'the crap out of him im not wit that shit.', '“Read: I PUNCH DAT LIL BITCH 3 TIMES AND DAT WAS IT.', 'DA HARDEST 1 WAS ON HIS STOMACH CUZ HE MOVED.', 'BUT LET HIM BE A MAN AND NOT A LIL BITCH LIKE U.', '“Read: WAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE OR ANYTHIN U GONNA', 'KNO.', '-6-', 'The evidence adduced at hearing with respect to the collection and documentation of the various cell phones not only is unclear, but evinces an apparent disregard by the Cranston Police Department for the chain of custody and preservation of what was ultimately extremely probative evidence in the state’s case against defendant. 6 For instance, Officer Machado testified that he confiscated defendant’s T-Mobile cell phone, and, instead of securing the phone into evidence at the police station, he secured the phone on his person.', 'Officer Machado subsequently gave defendant’s confiscated cell phone to Sgt. Walsh, who attempted to turn the phone on and, when unsuccessful, proceeded to place it in his pocket. The phone was then transferred from Sgt. Walsh to Det. Souza, and then to Det. Cushman before it was eventually logged into evidence at the police station later that day. Furthermore, according to the extraction', '“Sent: wateva u always think u didnt hit hard but u do u hurt me', 'could imagine wat u did 2 him 4 ur info he isn’t complaining just', 'him throwin up and in pain is enough', '“Sent: idk wat u did but u hurt is stomach real bad', '“* * *', '“Sent: wtf did u do 2 my son mike', '“Read: I TOLD U.

Kite’s testimony that the cell phone missing from the apartment after defendant’s departure was the Metro PCS phone (as opposed to the T-Mobile phone). Additionally,', '“[T]he many warrant affidavits mention that a Metro PCS cell', 'phone belonging to [defendant] was taken from him while he was', 'in police custody. Yet, that cell phone appears on the B.C.I.', 'seizure report and photographs taken at the apartment at 9:22 a.m.', 'reveal that the Metro PCS cell phone was on the dining room table', 'at the apartment at that time. In other testimony and at least one', 'warrant affidavit, it says that it was the T-Mobile cell phone that', 'was taken from * * * [d]efendant’s person.”', '-7- report 7 entered into evidence at the suppression hearing, at 8:09 a.m. a call was placed from the LG phone to the phone’s voicemail account. The hearing justice determined that, because the apartment had been secured at that point, a Cranston police officer must have placed the call during the course of the investigation. Additionally, photographs of the apartment make it apparent that, throughout the morning, officers picked up and moved the Metro PCS phone.', 'B', 'The Interrogation 8', 'While Sgt. Kite and the BCI detectives remained at the apartment, Det. Jean Slaughter and Det. John Cardone interrogated defendant at the police headquarters for nearly three hours, during which time defendant signed a form waiving his Miranda 9 rights. Throughout the entire interview, the detectives continuously raised the topic of defendant’s incriminating text messages to Oliver. At various points during the interview, Det. Slaughter and Det. Cardone left the interview room to consult with other officers, specifically about the content of the text messages on the LG phone. It is unclear whether the interrogating detectives saw the texts or photographs thereof firsthand, or were relayed the contents verbally; what is clear is that, during the course of the interrogation, the detectives were made aware of the incriminating text messages and 7', 'The extraction report, created pursuant to a June 8, 2012 warrant, was entered into evidence as state’s exhibit 32, and reveals, in detail, the contents of the phone, including: incoming/outgoing calls, text messages sent/received, alerts from the service provider, and any other information that remained on the phone at the time of extraction. 8', 'The CD recording of the interview entered into evidence at the suppression hearing is not contained in the record certified to this Court. The majority of the direct and cross-examinations of the two interrogating officers consists essentially of state and defense counsel playing clips of the recording and asking questions based on the recording. The interrogating detectives were seemingly unable or unwilling to recall any specifics regarding the interview that were not specifically contained on the recording. Detective Slaughter’s repeated unwillingness to acknowledge his own conduct, even after having the recording played for him in open court, clearly frustrated the hearing justice. 9', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-8- adjusted their questioning tactics accordingly. 10 After reentering the interrogation room, the detectives became much more aggressive in an apparent attempt to leverage the text messages against defendant. Detective Cardone threatened defendant that he would likely be charged with Marco’s murder, 11 and he began to quote some of the texts in which defendant allegedly admitted to being physical with Marco.', 'Although defendant was initially unwilling to acknowledge his participation in the text messaging, as well as any physical contact with Marco, the more of the text messages the detectives revealed, the more defendant admitted. Detective Slaughter then began explaining the possibility of leniency if defendant confessed; after which defendant admitted playing with Marco before he died, even admitting that he hit him in the ribs. Toward the end of the interrogation, Det. Slaughter made a direct reference to the text message Sgt. Kite had viewed earlier that morning regarding the marks on Marco’s neck. At this point, the detectives left defendant alone in the interrogation room to write a formal statement.', 'Upon returning to the interrogation room, Det. Slaughter reviewed defendant’s statement and noticed that it did not include some of the language that defendant had used earlier in the interview with regard to striking Marco. Detective Slaughter suggested to defendant that he include the specific language; defendant obliged the officer and added a statement about Marco taking a “body shot.” The defendant then initialed the statement at the detective’s request. 12 10', 'The testimony at the hearing was extraordinarily unhelpful in this regard as Sgt. Walsh, as well as Det. Slaughter and Det. Cardone, could not recall anything that occurred outside of the interrogation room. 11', 'Marco was still alive at the time of the interrogation. 12', 'The hearing justice excluded from use at trial defendant’s confession as well as significant portions of the recorded and transcribed interrogation. The hearing justice found that the detectives’ coercive interrogation tactics violated defendant’s due process rights. The state did not appeal the exclusion of the confession or the interrogation materials; therefore, the due process issues are not before this Court.', '-9- Shortly thereafter, defendant was handcuffed and placed in a holding cell, and Det. Slaughter and Det. Cardone left for Hasbro Children’s Hospital to continue the investigation.', 'C', 'The Hospital', 'At 12:30 p.m. on October 4, 2009, while at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, Trisha Oliver gave what would be the first of two formal, written statements to Cranston police personnel. In the statement, she explained that on October 3, 2009, at around 3 p.m. she heard Marco throw up, so she cleaned his clothes and gave him a shower. She also stated that defendant had been at her apartment, but left at approximately 3:50 p.m., and eventually returned at approximately 11 that same night. She stated that “[defendant] said he went to go hit [Marco] and [Marco] moved causing him to hit my son in the stomach.”', 'She further stated that although she slept intermittently, Marco continued vomiting throughout the night. When she finally woke up at about 6:10 a.m. the next morning to check on Marco, she noticed he was not breathing, at which point she called 9-1-1 and administered CPR.', 'Approximately one hour later at around 1:30 p.m., Det. Cardone and Det. Slaughter arrived at the hospital to check on Marco and speak with family and friends about a possible child-abuse situation. Doctor Christine Fortin provided the detectives with her initial report, which explained that Marco was in critical condition and that the nature of the injuries suggested evidence of child abuse. Shortly thereafter, Det. Cardone and Det. Slaughter administered a second rights form to Oliver and presented her with a “consent to search form” for the LG cell phone, which she signed.', 'Despite the best efforts of both the rescue and medical personnel, at 5:05 p.m., Marco succumbed to his injuries and died. At 6 p.m., Det. Cardone took a second, more detailed', '- 10 - written statement from Oliver concerning the events that had taken place on October 3, 2009. Although the timeline regarding Marco’s deteriorating physical condition was basically the same as in her first written statement, this statement had particular focus on defendant’s involvement with the situation. For instance, Oliver said that she asked defendant what happened and “[defendant] said Marco was ‘acting stupid and I hit him.’” This latter statement also included information about her strained relationship with defendant, specifically that she was “afraid of [defendant] because in the past his temper gets * * * out of control. He throws things and sometimes [gets] [physical] with me.”', 'D', 'The Warrants', 'Throughout the course of the investigation into Marco’s death, the Cranston police obtained more than a dozen search warrants, several of which yielded text messages that incriminated defendant. Members of the Cranston Police Department began seeking various search warrants as early as the morning of October 4, 2009, up through the time of the at-issue suppression hearing in August 2012. The various warrants allowed for the search and seizure of evidence at the scene, the contents of various cell phones, and the records of the service providers of the cell phones.', 'The hearing justice was troubled by the “inconsistencies and uncertainties” surrounding particular information contained in the various affidavits in support of search warrants presented throughout the investigation. Likewise, the hearing justice was troubled by the various officers’ testimonies, in that, in her estimation, “[they] knew more about this examination than they were willing to divulge [at the suppression hearing].” However, due to the length and density of the at-issue warrants and affidavits, we will not needlessly recount the challenged statements', '- 11 - contained in the warrant affidavits; rather, the relevant facts pertaining to defendant’s warrant challenges will be addressed as necessary, infra.', 'E', 'Procedural History', 'On April 2, 2010, defendant was indicted on a single count of first-degree murder 13 for the death of Marco Nieves. Prior to trial, defendant filed motions in limine to exclude text messages, including those sent by and to Trisha Oliver. In addition, defendant filed eight motions to suppress evidence that had been seized during the course of the October 4, 2009 investigation, as well as all the information seized from the different cell phones, on the grounds that the collection of such evidence violated his rights against unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, sections 6 and 13 of the Rhode Island Constitution.14 The defendant also argued that his videotaped and written statements taken on October 4, 2009, resulted from coercive and threatening police tactics, and thus were made involuntarily in violation of his due process rights under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.', 'On June 18, 2012, the Superior Court embarked on a multi-week series of evidentiary hearings to address the issues raised by defendant in his pretrial motions. On June 29, 2012, after the start of the evidentiary hearing, defendant filed an amended motion seeking a Franks hearing, arguing that the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing indicated that members of 13', 'G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1. 14', 'Specifically, defendant filed motions to suppress: (1) evidence seized on or about October 4, 2009; (2) all information seized from defendant’s T-Mobile phone; (3) all information seized from Oliver’s LG phone; (4) all information seized from Marco’s biological father, Rafael Nieves’s phone; (5) all information seized from defendant’s friend, Mario Palacio’s phone; (6) all information seized from Oliver’s landline phone; (7) the 8mm videotape of the crime scene; and (8) all information seized from the Metro PCS phone.', '- 12 - the Cranston Police Department made numerous material misrepresentations in their affidavits to obtain warrants throughout the course of the investigation.', 'On September 4, 2012, the hearing justice rendered a one-hundred-ninety page decision and an order granting defendant’s motions to suppress the evidence seized at the scene and all information seized from the various cell phones, including all of the text message evidence. The hearing justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress the videotape of the crime scene. In granting virtually all of defendant’s motions to suppress, the hearing justice made comprehensive findings with respect to defendant’s constitutional claims.', 'First, with respect to standing, the hearing justice found that “[d]efendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his alleged text messages,” so as to confer upon him standing to challenge the police search that led to the discovery of the text messages. The hearing justice also found that “people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their text messages with no distinction between whether the messages were sent or received by them,” and “that the third-party doctrine should not apply to diminish the expectation of privacy in the contents of electronic communications.” The hearing justice also found that, as a frequent overnight guest, defendant had standing to challenge the search and seizure of evidence in Oliver’s apartment.', 'Second, the hearing justice found that Sgt. Kite’s action of viewing the text messages on the LG phone during the initial stages of the October 4, 2009 sweep of Oliver’s apartment did not fall within the exigent circumstances, plain view, or consent exceptions to the warrant requirement, and therefore constituted an unreasonable search. The hearing justice also found that the searches and seizures by the police of all the cell phones in evidence, as well as the', '- 13 - photographs taken of the contents thereof, were either “illegal as warrantless or in excess of the warrants obtained,” and, thus, were also unreasonable in violation of the Fourth Amendment.', 'Finally, the hearing justice found that “almost all the evidence the Cranston Police Department obtained during the course of its investigation into the death of Marco Nieves was ‘tainted’ by the illegal search made by Sgt. Kite or the other illegal searches and seizures of cell phones and their contents,” and was thereby inadmissible at trial as fruit of the poisonous tree. 15', 'In regard to defendant’s Franks motion, the hearing justice found that there existed sufficient evidence in the record to “find that [d]efendant made a preliminary showing that the affidavits for the warrants do contain certain false statements, as specifically identified by [d]efendant, that were deliberate or made in reckless disregard of the truth.” Despite these preliminary findings, however, the hearing justice reserved decision as to whether defendant was entitled to a Franks hearing, “subject to further argument as to standing and probable cause.”', 'On September 12, 2012, the state timely appealed the hearing justice’s decision. That same day, the hearing justice entered an order that the ongoing trial proceedings relative to the Franks motion were not to be stayed by operation of law or in the discretion of the hearing justice, and that, absent a stay by this Court, the proceedings were to continue forthwith. 15', 'Specifically, the hearing justice excluded from use at trial the following pieces of evidence: (1) the LG phone; (2) the Metro PCS phone; (3) the iPhone; (4) the landline phone; (5) the T-Mobile phone; (6) the photographs of the contents of the LG phone taken at Oliver’s apartment; (7) the photographs of the contents of the LG phone taken at police headquarters; (8) the photographs of the contents of the Metro PCS phone; (9) the photographs of the contents of the T-Mobile phone; (10) the contents of the LG phone extracted by use of the Cellebrite software; (11) the phone records and communications of defendant provided by T-Mobile; (12) the phone records and communications of Mario Palacio provided by T-Mobile; (13) the phone records and communications of Oliver provided by Verizon; (14) the phone records and communications of Rafael Nieves provided by Sprint Nextel; (15) the phone records and communications of defendant’s sister, Angie Patino, provided by Sprint Nextel; (16) the landline phone records for the apartment provided by Cox Communications; (17) certain portions of defendant’s interrogation as memorialized on videotape and in a written transcript; and (18) defendant’s confession regarding the death of Marco Nieves.', '- 14 - Thereafter, the state filed with this Court a motion to compel compliance with § 9-24-33 to stay the Franks proceedings in the Superior Court until after resolution of the other issues on appeal. On September 25, 2012, this Court granted the state’s motion, 16 determining that “because § 9- 24-33 provides for a stay of any further proceedings with respect to those findings pending the State’s appeal, all further proceedings are stayed until further Order of this Court.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When reviewing a trial justice’s decision granting or denying a motion to suppress, we defer to the factual findings of the trial justice, applying a clearly erroneous standard.” State v.

Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740 (1979). Before delving into the question of what is “reasonable” in this day and age of rapidly evolving technology, however, it may be useful to provide an initial framework with respect to how, and for what purpose, the Fourth Amendment operates.', 'The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:', '“The right of the people to be secure in their persons,', 'houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and', 'seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but', 'upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and', 'particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or', 'things to be seized.” 19 The purpose of the Fourth Amendment, as well as its Rhode Island counterpart, is to “guarantee[] the privacy, dignity, and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government * * * .” Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Association, 489 U.S. 602, 613-14 (1989).', 'In order to avoid such arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement of Fourth Amendment principles, “the application of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a ‘justifiable,’ a ‘reasonable,’ or a ‘legitimate expectation of privacy’ that has been invaded by government action.” Smith, 442 U.S. at 740. Put another way, “a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that State v. Demasi, 452 A.2d 1150, 1153 (R.I. 1982) (applying clearly erroneous standard) with State v. McGoff, 517 A.2d 232, 237 (R.I. 1986) (applying abuse of discretion standard). 19', 'The provision of the Rhode Island Constitution protecting against illegal searches and seizures is virtually identical to the United States Constitution. See R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 6.', '- 16 - society recognizes as reasonable.” Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001). The question of whether a search and seizure is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment is based on the totality of the facts and circumstances of each case. Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58, 59 (1967).', 'A', 'Standing', 'It is well settled that “‘Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights’ and cannot be ‘asserted vicariously by a defendant merely because he or she may be aggrieved by the introduction of damaging evidence.’” State v. Quinlan, 921 A.2d 96, 109 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Bertram, 591 A.2d 14, 18 (R.I. 1991)); see Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 133 (1978). “A person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person’s premises or property has not had any of his [or her] Fourth Amendment rights infringed.” Rakas, 439 U.S. at 134. Therefore, in order to successfully invoke the protections of the Fourth Amendment, as a threshold matter, a “defendant bears the burden of establishing the requisite standing to challenge the legality of the search.” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109.', '“A party has standing when he or she is found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or the thing seized.” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109; see Katz v.

Krisco Corp., 653 N.E.2d 579, 582 (Mass. 1995)).', 'When deciding whether the expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable, “no single factor invariably will be determinative.” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109 (quoting State v.

In the past, this Court has looked to several factors to determine objective reasonableness, including: “whether the suspect possessed or owned the area searched or the property seized; his or her prior use of the area searched or the property seized; the person’s ability to control or exclude others’ use of the property; and the person’s legitimate presence in the area searched.” State v. Verrecchia, 766 A.2d 377, 382 (R.I. 2001).', 'In addition to examining the aforementioned, case-specific factors to determine reasonableness, courts also look backwards to history, see Rakas, 439 U.S. at 153 (“The Court on occasion also has looked to history to discern whether certain types of government intrusion were perceived to be objectionable by the Framers of the Fourth Amendment”), as well as forward, considering modern technological developments. See United States v. Jones, 132 S.Ct. 945, 962 (2012) (Alito, J., concurring) (“[T]echnology can change those expectations [of privacy].

She reached this decision by rejecting the analogy of a cell phone to a “closed container,” finding that defendant’s standing “does not * * * rise and fall based on his interest in the LG cell phone.” 20 She then undertook the two-tiered inquiry and found that defendant exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy in the content of his text messages and that “it is objectively reasonable for people to expect the contents of their electronic text messages to remain private.”', 'In determining that defendant’s expectation of privacy in his sent and received text messages was objectively reasonable, the hearing justice embarked on an extensive analysis in which she examined the increasing role that cell phones and text messages play in modern society. In addition, she rejected the comparison of text messaging to other similar forms of communication, such as telephone conversations and email exchanges, and determined that text messages “are a technological and functional hybrid,” and thus, she “[would] not strain * * * to apply existing law based on imperfect analogies.” Although she likened text messaging to oral communication based on their similar back-and-forth nature, she acknowledged that the analogy 20', 'The hearing justice noted that, if standing in the LG phone were predicated on the actual device, as opposed to the content of the text messages, she “would be constrained to conclude that [d]efendant ha[d] failed to demonstrate a sufficient privacy interest in the LG cell phone to establish standing in the device itself.”', '- 19 - is not perfect, and that “text messages are more vulnerable to discovery than oral communications, which in itself may cause individuals to have less of a subjective expectation of privacy in the content of those communications.” Despite the admittedly diminished expectation of privacy, she nevertheless found that “a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his or her text messages.” She therefore held that “[d]efendant possesse[d] standing to challenge the actions of the Cranston Police Department in searching the LG cell phone and viewing his alleged text messages to and those messages from Trisha Oliver.”', 'The state argues that defendant does not have standing to challenge the search of Oliver’s LG phone and, further, that defendant cannot claim standing in the phone merely because Oliver had used it to exchange text messages with him. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that people have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of their text messages. However, the crux of defendant’s argument on appeal is not defendant’s standing in the text messages, but rather his standing, by virtue of his frequent overnight stays, to challenge the warrantless search of Oliver’s apartment. In that vein, defendant argues that Sgt. Kite was not lawfully in the apartment when he searched the LG phone and that, therefore, all the evidence seized as a result of that unlawful search should be excluded at trial.', 'Before addressing the expectation of privacy in the text message communications, we first dispel defendant’s contention that, because he has standing to challenge the search of Oliver’s apartment, everything seized without a warrant is subject to suppression as violative of his Fourth Amendment rights. Although the evidence adduced at the hearing below indicates, and the state does not contest, that defendant, as a frequent overnight guest at Oliver’s apartment, did have a reasonable expectation of privacy in her apartment, this does not end our inquiry. See Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 96-97 (1990).', 'In order to raise a Fourth Amendment', '- 20 - challenge, it is not sufficient that a defendant merely have standing in the area searched; he must also have an expectation of privacy in the item seized. See United States v. Haqq, 278 F.3d 44, 50 (2nd Cir. 2002) (“when considering the legality of a search of an object within a home, courts have properly focused on the defendant’s expectation of privacy in the object apart from his expectation of privacy in the home”); United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 219-20 (1st Cir. 1989) (homeowner lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in a box located in his wife’s dresser where he claimed no interest in the box or its contents); Wayne R. LaFave et. al., Criminal Procedure § 9.1(b) n.51 at 389 (3d ed. 2007) (“A person in possession of premises has standing with regard to a search of those premises and also a seizure of the objects therein, * * * but does not also have standing as to the search of a container belonging to another in the premises.”). We therefore must determine if defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items searched and seized; specifically, the LG phone and the text messages evidenced therein.', 'Moreover, we reject defendant’s contention that “[Sgt.] Kite’s presence in the home when he searched the LG cell phone * * * at approximately 7:15 a.m., forty-five minutes after the tour with Trish[a] Oliver and nearly an hour after the minor left, was unconstitutional.”', 'The circumstances of the case were that the Cranston police had responded to a 9-1-1 call for a medical emergency. Upon arriving at the scene they encountered an unresponsive child and obvious signs of nauseous distress. After the child and Oliver left for the hospital, there still remained a second young child (Jazlyn) and defendant, who was not a tenant of the apartment. It is our opinion that, under these circumstances, an hour was not an unreasonable amount of time for Sgt. Kite and other police officers to remain on the scene. To the extent that the trial justice', '- 21 - found that the police were not lawfully in the apartment after Marco and Oliver had been transported to the hospital, it is our opinion that her finding was clear error.', '1. Expectation of Privacy in Text Messages', 'Although text messaging has enjoyed a precipitous rise in usage and popularity, it is still a relatively new phenomenon and, as is often the case with new technology, courts may struggle to adapt existing legal principles to new realities. It is often not easy to pour new wine into old wineskins, yet wise stewardship might suggest the use of the old skins until they burst. So too, legal principles and rules of law developed in the context of more antediluvian forms of communication may provide useful guidance for our analysis of the issues presented in this case. As this Court has previously recognized, “the evolution of the common law should occur gradually, predictably, and incrementally.” State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 454 (R.I. 2008). The central question confronting us in this case is relatively narrow, viz., whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her text messages stored in a cell phone belonging to, or possessed by, another person.', 'Because it is an issue of first impression in this state, we will look to other jurisdictions, as well as our own jurisprudence, to determine whether that particular expectation of privacy is one that society is willing to recognize as objectively reasonable.', 'Several courts throughout the country have recently opined as to whether a person has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her text messages. These courts, much like the hearing justice in the instant case, have drawn parallels between text messages and other forms of communication to aid in their ultimate determination. See, e.g., United States v. Zavala, 541 F.3d 562, 577 (5th Cir. 2008) (comparing a cell phone to a personal computer carried on one’s person); State v. Clampitt, 364 S.W.3d 605, 611 (Mo. Ct.

Hinton, 319 P.3d 9, 14 (Wash. 2014) (although decided on state constitutional grounds, the court stated that “[w]hile text messages have much in common with phone calls and letters, they are a unique form of communication, and we will not strain to apply analogies where they do not fit”).', 'Although courts have ultimately reached different conclusions on whether there exists a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages, the determinations have most often turned on whether the defendant owned or was the primary user of the cell phone. See, e.g., United States v. Finley, 477 F.3d 250, 259 (5th Cir. 2007) (holding that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a cell phone because, inter alia, he “maintained a property interest in the phone, [and] had a right to exclude others from using the phone”); United States v. Jones, 149 F.App’x 954, 959 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his sent text messages contained on his coconspirator’s cell phone); United States v. Davis, 787 F.Supp.2d 1165, 1170 (D. Or. 2011) (holding that the defendant had “a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her personal cell phone, including call records and text messages”); State v. Boyd, 992 A.2d 1071, 1081 (Conn. 2010) (holding that because the defendant “owned the cell phone and exercised exclusive control over it * * * he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the cell phone”); State v. Bone, 107 So.3d 49, 66 (La. Ct. App. 2012) (holding that the defendant, as “the exclusive user of the cell phone” had “a reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages sent and received on the cell phone”); Clampitt, 364 S.W.3d at 611 (holding that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy', '- 23 - in the text messages and other information contained in his phone, notwithstanding the fact that the information was disclosed to a third-party cell service provider).', 'In determining whether a person has an expectation of privacy in his text messages, the most important factor, in our opinion, is from whose phone the messages are accessed. Underlying this consideration is the element of control; that is to say, when the recipient receives the message, the sender relinquishes control over what becomes of that message on the recipient’s phone. The idea of control has been central to our prior determinations of whether an individual has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy so as to confer standing to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge. See Verrecchia, 766 A.2d at 382 (factoring, inter alia, whether suspect possessed or owned the property seized; and, his or her ability to control or exclude others). The United States Supreme Court has likewise considered control as a factor when determining whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a given place or item. See, e.g., Rakas, 439 U.S. at 154 (noting the distinction “between the Fourth Amendment rights of passengers and the rights of an individual who has exclusive control of an automobile or of its locked compartments”) (emphasis added).', 'Additionally, the Supreme Court has determined that, “when an individual reveals private information to another,” a reasonable expectation of privacy no longer exists because “he assumes the risk that his confidant will reveal that information to the authorities.” United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 117 (1984); see United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (1976).', 'Implicit in the risk inherent in the disclosure of information to another party is the relinquishment of control, i.e., the sender can no longer control what the recipient does with the message. See, e.g., United States v. King, 55 F.3d 1193, 1196 (6th Cir. 1995) (“the sender’s expectation of privacy ordinarily terminates upon delivery * * * even though the sender may', '- 24 - have instructed the recipient to keep the letters private”); United States v. Maxwell, 45 M.J. 406, 418 (C.A.A.F. 1996) (although a sender of an email enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy, “once the transmissions are received by another person, the transmitter no longer controls its destiny”). Because the recipient now shares full control of whether to share or disseminate the sender’s message, the sender, to be sure, no longer enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy in the digital copy of the message contained on the recipient’s device. 21 With these considerations in mind, we turn to the facts of the instant case to determine whether defendant had standing to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge.', 'It is clear to us that the cell phone of primary concern in this case, the LG phone, was used exclusively by Trisha Oliver. The defendant exhibited no dominion or control, nor did he attempt to exclude others from accessing the phone. This is evinced by the facts that he made no motion towards the phone in response to the message alert, did not attempt to prevent Sgt. Kite from accessing the contents of the phone, and did not bring the phone with him when he accompanied Officer Machado to the police station. In fact, defendant’s only connection to the LG phone is the fact that a digital copy of the messages he sent from his T-Mobile phone existed on the LG phone. Having already sent the incriminating text messages, which were indeed delivered to Oliver’s LG phone, defendant no longer had any control over what became of the messages contained in that phone. The defendant’s lack of control over who could view or access the text messages is underscored by the fact that Oliver signed a consent form allowing the Cranston police officers to search her phone, albeit after they had already viewed the incriminating messages. Therefore, in light of the considerations and rationale enunciated above, 21', 'We can think of no media more susceptible to sharing or dissemination than a digital message, such as a text message or email, which vests in the recipient a digital copy of the message that can be forwarded to or shared with others at the mere click of a button.', '- 25 - it is our considered opinion that defendant did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in any text messages contained in Trisha Oliver’s LG phone, whether sent by defendant, sent to defendant, or otherwise. It necessarily follows that, having no reasonable expectation of privacy in the LG phone or the messages contained therein, defendant did not have standing to challenge the search and seizure thereof.', 'When recently confronted with facts similar to the instant case, i.e., privacy expectations of text messages contained on the phone of another, the Washington Supreme Court did not reach the issue of expectation of privacy in the Fourth Amendment context, opting instead to decide the case on independent state constitutional grounds. Hinton, 319 P.3d at 11, 14. We agree wholeheartedly with the dissent in that case, however, which, in arguing that the defendant lacked standing to challenge the search, stated that:', '“[The sender] did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in', '[the recipient’s] cell phone. He had neither possession nor control', 'of the cell phone, and he did not have the right to exclude others', 'from using it. Furthermore, once the text message was delivered to', '[the recipient’s] cell phone, [the sender] had no control over who', 'viewed it. * * * [The recipient] could have simply shared the', 'contents of the message with others. [The sender] assumed the risk', 'that, once sent, the message would no longer be kept private.” Id.', 'at 22 (Johnson, J., dissenting).', 'We hold, therefore, that defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages contained in Oliver’s phone, whether sent from or received by that phone, does not extend to the messages contained on another’s phone, despite the fact that there exists an identical copy of the messages on the challenger’s phone. 22 As iterated above, this is chiefly due to control; a cell phone user retains control over what becomes of the content on his or her 22', 'Because defendant was not under arrest when he relinquished his phone at the Cranston police headquarters, we save for another day the issue of whether one’s personal cell phone can be subject to a warrantless search incident to a valid arrest.', '- 26 - phone, but entirely loses control of the messages contained on the phone of another. When applied to the case at hand, therefore, we conclude that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy, and thus no standing to challenge the search and seizure of Oliver’s LG phone, its contents, and all derivatives therefrom. 23', 'We vacate, therefore, the September 12, 2012 order of the Superior Court insofar as it excludes from evidence “the LG cell phone”; “the pictures of the contents of the LG cell phone taken at Trisha Oliver’s apartment”; “the pictures of the contents of the LG cell phone taken at Cranston Police Department headquarters”; “the Cellebrite extraction report for the LG cell phone”; and “the phone records and communications of Trisha Oliver provided by Verizon.”', 'We further vacate the order insofar as it excludes from trial evidence that the hearing justice found to be “tainted” as fruits of the poisonous tree. 24 Such evidence consists of “the phone records and communications of Mario Palacio provided by T-Mobile”; “the phone records and communications of Angie Patino provided by Sprint Nextel”; and “the landline phone records for Trisha Oliver’s apartment provided by Cox Communications.”', 'B', 'The T-Mobile and Metro PCS Cell Phones', 'The hearing justice made several damaging findings with respect to the legality of the searches and seizures of all four cell phones discovered in Oliver’s apartment. She reasoned that the police “focused on the cell phones and text messages at the earliest stages of the investigation and well before they sought or obtained the first search warrant for the apartment.”', 'She 23', 'This includes the photographs of the contents of the LG phone taken at the police station and at Trisha Oliver’s apartment; the Cellebrite extraction report from the phone; and the records of the phone obtained from Verizon. 24', 'The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine dictates that “physical, tangible materials obtained either during or as a direct result of an unlawful invasion” are traditionally excluded from use at trial.

Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), arguing that “[t]he relevant affidavits were more than sufficient to establish probable cause, even with the removal of the materials identified by the hearing justice.” We first note that, with respect to the Franks challenges, the hearing justice determined only that defendant had made a substantial preliminary showing that the warrant applications contained materially false statements. Thus, the sufficiency of any additional evidence establishing probable cause has not been determined.', 'With respect to the legality of the searches and seizures, however, the state raises only a cursory challenge to the hearing justice’s finding as it pertains to the T-Mobile and Metro PCS cell phones. We have often stated that “[s]imply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.” State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1256 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Wilkinson v.

Because the state does not meaningfully contest the hearing justice’s findings regarding the T-Mobile and Metro PCS cell phones, we consider the issue waived. 26 Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court order suppressing evidence of “the Metro PCS phone,” “the iPhone,” “the T-Mobile cell phone,” and “the pictures of the contents of the Metro PCS [and T-Mobile] cell phone[s].”', 'C', 'Franks Determination', 'Having made our determinations regarding defendant’s standing to challenge the various items of evidence, as well as the legality of the searches, we address briefly the hearing justice’s Franks determinations. In Franks, the United States Supreme Court established a procedure for challenging warrants alleged to have been obtained through the use of affidavits containing “false statement[s] made knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.” Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56; see Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 99. Franks established a procedure under which a defendant may challenge the veracity of factual statements made in affidavits supporting the issuance of Fourth Amendment search warrants. Before a hearing is required, however, the defendant must vault over two hurdles.', 'First, he must make a “substantial preliminary showing that a false statement [was made] knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth * * * .” Franks, 438 U.S. at 155. Secondly, the defendant must 26', 'It is unclear to us who owned the iPhone at issue.

Id. at 156. Only then is the defendant entitled to a Franks hearing.', 'Moreover, because a Franks hearing concerns the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, in order to raise a Franks challenge, a defendant must establish standing in the area or items sought to be searched and seized by the challenged warrant. See Rakas, 439 U.S. at 133- 34; Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109; e.g., United States v. Mastromatteo, 538 F.3d 535, 544 (6th Cir. 2008) (“Determining that a defendant has Fourth Amendment standing is a prerequisite to granting a motion for a Franks hearing.”). We review a court’s Franks determination with deference. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 99.', 'On appeal, the state raises two challenges with respect to the hearing justice’s Franks determinations. First, the state argues that, “except with respect to defendant’s own phones, he has no standing to make a Franks challenge.” Second, the state avers that “[b]ecause, with respect to his own phones, the relevant affidavits were more than sufficient to establish probable cause, even with the removal of the materials identified by the hearing justice, the lower court’s Franks determinations cannot stand.” We need not address either contention.', 'In light of our prior determinations on standing, discussed supra, we agree with the state and hold that defendant, who lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items sought by several of the warrants, 27 did not have standing to raise a Franks challenge to those warrants. We therefore need not address the hearing justice’s preliminary findings with respect to those warrants. Furthermore, because, as discussed supra, we uphold the hearing justice’s findings that 27', 'The defendant has not satisfied his burden of establishing standing to challenge the following warrants: an October 4, 2009 warrant to search the LG phone; three October 6, 2009 warrants seeking the phone records of, respectively, Mario Palacio, Trisha Oliver, and Rafael Nieves; and two October 8, 2009 warrants seeking records of, respectively, Angie Patino’s cell phone and Trisha Oliver’s apartment landline phone.', '- 30 - the Metro PCS cell phone, the T-Mobile phone, and the iPhone were searched and seized illegally, the state is precluded from introducing those items at trial, rendering moot defendant’s challenges to the warrants seeking those items and their derivatives.', 'To the extent that any of the warrants yet have vitality, we perceive no basis to disturb the hearing justice’s finding that the defendant has made a substantial preliminary showing that the warrant affidavits contain certain false statements that were deliberate or made in reckless disregard for the truth. We caution, however, that, before a Franks hearing is warranted, the Superior Court must still determine whether, after disregarding the allegedly false statements, there remain sufficiently reliable allegations in the affidavit to establish probable cause.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the order of the Superior Court.', 'Specifically, we vacate the September 12, 2012 order insofar as it suppressed the following evidence: “(1) the LG cell phone”; “(5) the apartment landline phone”; “(6) the pictures of the contents of the LG cell phone taken at Trisha Oliver’s apartment”; “(7) the pictures of the contents of the LG cell phone taken at Cranston Police Department headquarters”; “(10) the Cellebrite extraction report for the LG cell phone”; “(12) the phone records and communications of Mario Palacio provided by T-Mobile”; “(13) the phone records and communications of Trisha Oliver provided by Verizon”; “(14) the phone records and communications of Rafael Nieves provided by Sprint Nextel”; “(15) the phone records and communications of Angie Patino provided by Sprint Nextel”; and “(16) the landline phone records for Trisha Oliver’s apartment provided by Cox Communications.” We affirm the order', '- 31 - in all other respects.

American Steel Coatings, LLC (American Steel) appeals from a December 7, 20112 order, in which a justice of the Providence County Superior Court voided as usurious a “Loan Agreement, Promissory Note, and Mortgage granted to American Steel * * * by New England Development RI, LLC [(N.E. Development)]” and that entity’s owner, Lawrence C. LaBonte. American Steel contends on appeal that the hearing justice erred when he determined that the “commercial loan commitment fee” (as American Steel characterizes it) contained in the loan agreement between the parties was to be considered interest because it did not fall within the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 6-26-2(c)(1) (which details 1', 'We have captioned this case in the manner employed by the parties in their briefs to this Court.

American Steel further contends that the hearing justice also erred when he concluded that the loan agreement was not rendered non-usurious by the presence of a usury “savings clause.”', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel 3', 'On August 10, 2010, Mr. LaBonte filed a petition in Providence County Superior Court seeking “the reorganization and/or the orderly liquidation and dissolution” of N.E. Development. In that petition, American Steel was listed as the “first lien holder on the [p]roperty located at One Main Street, Scituate, Rhode Island” (the Scituate property). Thereafter, on November 23, 2010, American Steel filed a “Motion to Approve Secured Claim, Authorize Credit Bid and Approve Release of Funds”4 (motion to approve secured claim) in an attempt to recover the funds that it alleged were owed pursuant to the loan agreement between the parties, which was dated January 8, 2010.', 'In the motion to approve secured claim, American Steel alleged that N.E. Development had granted it a “first position mortgage” for the Scituate property in exchange for a loan with a principal amount of $325,000; American Steel contended that it was owed a total of $412,614.54 from N.E. Development ($403,952.04 of which it claimed was due pursuant to the loan agreement).5', 'New England Development’s permanent receiver, Peter J.

We have conformed those headings to our usual style throughout this opinion. 5', 'According to the motion to approve secured claim, the total due included the principal of the loan, accrued unpaid interest, late fees, and “reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.”', '-2- LaBonte filed objections, asserting that the loan agreement between American Steel and N.E. Development was void because the amount of interest to be charged violated Rhode Island’s usury laws.6 A hearing was conducted on June 23, 2011. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that hearing.', 'A', 'The Hearing Testimony', '1. American Steel’s Witnesses', 'i.', 'The Testimony of John J. Vallone', 'John Vallone testified that he was the attorney who represented American Steel “in connection with [the] loan to [N.E.] Development;” he stated that he prepared the promissory note from N.E. Development to American Steel, as well as “a loan agreement between the parties,” a guarantee from Mr. LaBonte, and a “mortgage deed to secure the promissory note.” He testified that the purpose of the loan was to purchase property which he termed “the Hope Mill property” located in Scituate.', 'Attorney Vallone further testified that he was a party to “two or three” meetings between Mr. LaBonte on the one hand and Eric Greene (who, according to the “Proof of Claim” filed by American Steel, was “the managing member” of American Steel), and Joseph Garies (who Mr. Vallone stated was Mr. LaBonte’s “advisor”) on the other hand.7 Mr. Vallone testified that it was his understanding that American Steel would provide “$275,000” as a “short term loan for 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 6-26-2(a) sets the maximum rate of interest at “twenty-one percent (21%) per annum.” See Part II.B, infra, for a more thorough discussion. 7', 'Joseph Garies testified that he was a “consultant” who “introduce[d] borrowers to lenders for different transactions.” He stated that he was the “sole shareholder” of a company called “Global Consulting [Group],” which contracted with Mr. LaBonte to obtain financing to purchase the Scituate property.', '-3- 30 days,” to enable Mr. LaBonte to purchase the Scituate property. Mr. Vallone added that the intent of the parties was effectuated by a loan in the amount of $325,000 with an interest rate of 16 percent per annum.', 'According to Mr. Vallone’s testimony, at the maturity date, N.E. Development would pay back $325,000 plus interest, which would include a $50,000 “commercial loan commitment fee,” to be split between American Steel and Mr. Garies. Mr. Vallone testified that the $50,000 would be split—$30,000 being allocated to American Steel and $20,000 being allocated to Mr. Garies.8 It was Mr. Vallone’s testimony that the borrowers on the loan was both N.E. Development “[a]nd Mr. Labonte [sic] individually.”', 'Mr. Vallone further noted that he included a “savings clause” in the promissory note to “alleviate [his] concerns about any potential usury for the note.” The promissory note was admitted as an exhibit.', 'ii.', 'The Testimony of Lawrence LaBonte', 'American Steel called Lawrence LaBonte as an adverse witness. Mr. LaBonte testified to the details of the loan agreement in a manner largely consistent with Mr. Vallone’s testimony.', 'Mr. LaBonte acknowledged that he signed the loan agreement “[b]oth individually and as a member of [N.E.] Development.” He confirmed that, at the closing on January 8, 2010, $275,000 of the $325,000 loan amount was provided by American Steel. Moreover, in his testimony, he confirmed that a $50,000 fee was due at the closing to be divided between American Steel and Mr. Garies; he added that the loan agreement provided that at the closing he owed American Steel $325,000 plus “16 percent” interest.', 'It was Mr. LaBonte’s further testimony that he had not made any of the payments owed to American Steel pursuant to the loan agreement. 8', 'Mr. Garies testified that, as of the time of the hearing, he had not received his $20,000 fee.', '-4-', '2. Lawrence LaBonte & N.E. Development’s Witnesses', 'i.', 'The Testimony of James M. Roche', 'James Roche testified that he was a “[s]elf-employed commercial finance specialist and a turnaround company consultant.” His testimony focused on commercial loan commitment fees in general as well as the specific commitment fee at issue in the instant case. He testified that a commitment fee is generally money that is “paid at the closing,” not money that is paid at a later time. He stated that a commitment fee “is basically a lender committing that they have the funds available, and by executing that commitment document, you would either pay the commitment fee with the execution of the document or you would pay it at the closing of the loan;” he added that commitment fees are “typically” a “percentage of the loan” and that “industry standards” would call for a commitment fee which was “half to one percent of the total amount financed.”', 'It was his testimony that, in his experience, a $50,000 commitment fee on a $275,000 loan was “[u]nreasonable.” He further stated that he had “[n]ever” seen “a situation where the commitment fee was paid at the time the loan was supposed to be paid off[.]”', 'ii.', 'The Testimony of Eric Greene', 'Mr. Greene, the “managing member” of American Steel, was the last witness to testify at the hearing. According to his testimony, his loan to N.E. Development was the first loan that he had made to anyone other than a member of his family; he stated: “Prior to this, prior to me being asked to lend Mr. Labonte [sic] some money, I have never lent any money in my life other than family.” He testified that, because N.E. Development “couldn’t afford to pay” the $50,000 commitment fee at the time of closing, he “allowed” it to be paid at the maturity date. When asked what he “expected to be paid back” at the maturity date, he testified as follows:', '“I expected to get back after 30 days $325,000, which included', '[Mr. LaBonte’s] commitment to his mortgage broker [(Mr.', '-5-', 'Garies)], which he couldn’t afford to pay at the closing; and it', 'included the commitment fee which I had extended him, the 30', 'days with interest. That was his design. And, plus one month’s', 'interest based upon 16 percent per * * * annual amount, which --', 'which would’ve been $329,000, $4,000 interest approximately at', 'the time when the note was due. That’s what we expected back.” It was Mr. Greene’s testimony that the commitment fee was “going to reimburse [his] costs to make the loan.”', 'B', 'The Decision of the Hearing Justice', 'After the hearing, the parties submitted post-hearing memoranda; and subsequently, on November 14, 2011, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision, in which he ruled in favor of N.E. Development and Mr. LaBonte.', 'The hearing justice first summarized the factual background of the case. He then pointed out that, under § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv), “[c]ommercial loan commitment * * * fees” are not considered “interest.” However, in the opinion of the hearing justice, “no good and clear definition” for the term “commercial [loan] commitment fee” could be found in Rhode Island law. He nonetheless concluded that, in this case, “what has been termed by the lender and [the operative] documents as a commitment fee is nothing more than a disguised addition to interest * * * .” Consequently, the hearing justice determined that the fee in this case did not “fit” within the provisions of § 6- 26-2(c)(1)(iv) “so as not to be considered interest.” He proceeded to address whether, when the commitment fee was considered interest, the loan violated the usury statute; he concluded that, although the exact interest rate in this case was “difficult to fathom,” it was “not difficult for [the] Court to make an absolute determination” that the interest rate was “substantially in excess of 21 percent” regardless of how it was calculated.', '-6-', 'Turning to the usury savings clause, the hearing justice looked to § 6-26-4(a) which provides that usurious contracts are “void.” After a thorough analysis, he stated that “to give a lender the ability to nullify the policy of this state by including * * * a savings clause, would do violence to what our General Assembly has said the law ought to be and is.” Accordingly, an order was issued on December 7, 20119 sustaining the objections of the receiver and Mr. LaBonte to American Steel’s motion to approve secured claim and voiding the “Loan Agreement, Promissory Note, and Mortgage.” American Steel filed a timely notice of appeal on December 20, 2011.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'As we have often indicated we review “questions of statutory construction in a de novo manner.”', 'State v.

Consequently, we conduct a de novo review of a “trial justice’s interpretation of a contract.” Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 11 A.3d at 649; see also Cheaters, Inc., 41 A.3d at 642.', 'B', 'Commercial Loan Commitment Fee', 'American Steel argues that the fee involved in the instant case is in fact a “commercial loan commitment fee” and, as provided for in § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv), it should not be considered to be interest. It contends to this Court that the “underlying principle of the usury statute is to protect disadvantaged borrowers from unscrupulous lenders.” We can infer from that contention that American Steel is positing that we should interpret our statutory law with respect to usury in such a way as to find that this loan agreement is not void because, in this case, the lender, and not as is more common the borrower, was the inexperienced party.', '-8-', 'Mr. Furness, the receiver for N.E. Development, argues on appeal that the interest charged pursuant to the loan agreement is usurious even if the $20,000 fee to Mr. Garies is not considered interest. He draws the Court’s attention to the fact that the only document pertinent to this case which mentions the so-called “commercial loan commitment fee” is the loan agreement which he posits is, “at best, * * * contradictory and confusing.” He further avers that the fee is not a “commitment from [American Steel] to make funds available to [N.E. Development] for any specified amount or for any specified period of time as required by the statute.” Mr. Furness adds that Mr. Roche, the expert who testified at the hearing, “testified that the $50,000 charge did not comply with his understanding of a commitment fee.” Lastly, he contends that, if this Court were to give credence to American Steel’s arguments, “any userer [sic] could escape the provisions of §[]6-26-2 by simply re-characterizing the interest charge in excess of 21% as a ‘commitment fee.’”', 'We begin our analysis with a brief discussion of the applicable statutes in the instant case. The clear provisions of § 6-26-2(a) read in pertinent part as follows:', '“[N]o person, partnership, association, or corporation loaning', 'money to or negotiating the loan of money for another, except duly', 'licensed pawnbrokers, shall, directly or indirectly, reserve, charge,', 'or take interest on a loan, whether before or after maturity, at a rate', 'which shall exceed the greater of twenty-one percent (21%) per', 'annum * * * .” If a loan is found to charge more than the prescribed maximum of 21 percent per annum, one looks to § 6-26-4(a) which provides:', '“Every contract made in violation of any of the provisions of § 6-', '26-2, and every mortgage, pledge, deposit, or assignment made or', 'given as security for the performance of the contract, shall be', 'usurious and void.”', '-9-', 'Section 6-26-2(c)(1) details various fees and costs which, for the purposes of calculating whether a contract is usurious, “shall not be” considered interest. The subsection of that statute pertinent to the instant case is § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv), which includes the following among items that are not deemed to be interest:', '“Commercial loan commitment or availability fees to assure the', 'availability of a specified amount of credit for a specified period of', 'time or, at the borrower’s option, compensating balances in lieu of', 'the fees[.]”', 'The crux of the issue with which we are confronted is whether the $50,000 fee, which American Steel contends is nothing more than a “commercial loan commitment fee,” is in fact a “[c]ommercial loan commitment * * * fee[]” pursuant to the terms of § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv). Thus, our task is one of statutory construction.', 'When reviewing a statute, we first address whether or not the statute is clear and unambiguous. See State v. DiCicco, 707 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 1998); see also Diamante, 83 A.3d at 550. “If we find the statute to be unambiguous, we simply apply the plain meaning and our interpretive task is done.” Diamante, 83 A.3d at 550; see DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 616; see also Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1, 89-90 (1823) (“[W]here the words of a law * * * have a plain and obvious meaning, all construction, in hostility with such meaning, is excluded.”). We cease the task of construing a statute when we have determined that it has a plain meaning because “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent,” Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003), and the plain language of a statute is the “best indicator of [legislative] intent.” Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 534 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Diamante, 83 A.3d at 550; see also Little v. Conflict of Interest Commission, 121 R.I. 232, 237, 397 A.2d 884, 887 (1979).', '- 10 -', 'We are well aware that the General Assembly has opted for a rather draconian manner of dealing with the problem of usury. But we certainly cannot say that the General Assembly’s strong medicine in this domain is arbitrary or wrongful, and our role is not to second-guess such legislative judgments. We are mindful of the ancient maxim dura lex sed lex (“The law is hard but it is the law.”). Although the very learned hearing justice stated that there was “no good and clear definition” of a “commercial loan commitment fee” in Rhode Island law, upon our review of the statute in question, it is our respectful judgment that that term is defined clearly and unambiguously therein. See DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 616 (stating that “a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the plain language of the statute, a “[c]ommercial loan commitment * * * fee[]” is a fee to “assure the availability of a specified amount of credit for a specified period of time.” See Downey, 996 A.2d at 1150. To hold otherwise would render that language moot and would violate our basic “canon of statutory construction,” which provides that “the Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statue to express a significant meaning, and the court will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 779 (R.I. 1996); see also State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 752 (R.I. 1981). Consequently, what remains to be done is for us to simply apply the plain meaning of § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv) to the loan agreement at issue in this case.', 'In the instant case, the so-called “commercial loan commitment fee” did not “assure the availability of a specified amount of credit for a specified period of time.” Section 6-26- 2(c)(1)(iv).', 'According to the testimony at trial, after American Steel provided N.E. Development with $275,000 at the closing, American Steel would not be disbursing any further funds to N.E. Development pursuant to the agreement between the parties. Moreover, as Mr.', '- 11 - LaBonte’s testimony reflected, N.E. Development had no expectation pursuant to the agreement between the parties that funds beyond the $275,000 would be available to it.10 Thus, we are simply unable to conclude that the fee in the instant case was a “[c]ommercial loan commitment * * * fee[]” as that term is defined in § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv).', 'Consequently, we come to the inescapable conclusion that the fee in the instant case was a part of the interest being charged on the loan. Thus, for a thirty-day loan of $275,000,11 N.E. Development was to pay American Steel $325,000 plus one month of accrued interest on the $325,000 at a rate of 16 percent per annum.', 'The record reflects a number of different calculations attempting to establish the actual amount of interest which was to be charged in the instant case once the $50,000 fee was included as interest. The results of those calculations vary widely but they all have one thing in common—each substantially exceeds the statutorily- allowed 21 percent interest.12 Therefore, the hearing justice appropriately found the loan in the instant case to be usurious and, consequently, void pursuant to § 6-26-4(a). 10', 'We remind the reader that, in addition to the testimony elicited at the hearing about the intent of the parties to this loan, Mr. Roche testified that a $50,000 commitment fee on a $275,000 loan was “[u]nreasonable” and that he had “[n]ever” seen “a situation where the commitment fee was paid at the time the loan was supposed to be paid off[.]” 11', 'We have previously held that “[t]he standard for computation of the maximum interest and the test of the transaction is not the stated amount of a loan, but the amount of money actually received by the borrower.” Burdon v. Unrath, 47 R.I. 227, 230, 132 A. 728, 729 (1926); see NV One, LLC v. Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, 84 A.3d 800, 805 (R.I. 2014) (“In order to determine whether an interest rate is usurious, the face amount of the loan is irrelevant; instead, the maximum allowable interest is calculated based on the amount actually received by the borrower.”); see also Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island v. Stuard, 113 R.I. 124, 125, 318 A.2d 452, 453 (1974). As such, we have based our calculations of the interest rate in the instant case on the $275,000 that was “actually received by” N.E. Development. 12', 'We note that American Steel does not appear to contest on appeal that, if the $50,000 fee is considered interest, the loan is usurious.', 'We also note that the calculations of the rate of interest in the instant case are also universally over the 21 percent maximum when only the $30,000 due to American Steel is considered interest and not the $20,000 fee intended for Mr. Garies.', '- 12 -', 'Our conclusion is buttressed by our analysis in the recently decided case of NV One, LLC v. Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, 84 A.3d 800, 807-08 (R.I. 2014), relative to the intent of the General Assembly with respect to the enactment of the usury statutes. See Downey, 996 A.2d at 1150 (“[I]t is this [C]ourt’s responsibility in interpreting a legislative enactment * * * to attribute to the enactment the meaning most consistent with its policies or obvious purposes.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In NV One, LLC, we stated that “it is clear that the Legislature intended an inflexible, hardline approach to usury that is tantamount to strict liability;” it was our opinion that that “rigid approach” was “borne out in the historically strict enforcement of the statute and its predecessors through the years.” NV One, LLC, 84 A.3d at 807, 808; see, e.g., Burdon v. Unrath, 47 R.I. 227, 231, 132 A. 728, 730 (1926) (holding that, in relation to a usurious loan agreement, “[t]he intent of the lender was to do exactly what he did” and “[h]is mistake, if any, was one of law not of fact” which “is no excuse for the violation of the statute”).', 'Moreover, we held that the “underlying policy consistent throughout [our past] decisions is readily apparent: Usurious interest rates are to be avoided at all costs and the onus is on the lender to ensure compliance with the maximum rate of interest.”13 NV One, LLC, 84 A.3d at 808. Thus, our construing of § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv) is consistent with public policy and with the expressed intent of the General Assembly with respect to the usury statutes.', 'Accordingly, we hold that we perceive no error in the decision of the hearing justice that the so-called “commercial loan commitment fee” in the loan agreement before us was not a “[c]ommercial loan commitment * * * fee[]” within the meaning of § 6-26-2(c)(1)(iv) and that, 13', 'That principle is true even if the lender, as in the instant case, is comparatively inexperienced.', '- 13 - consequently, it was considered part of the interest on the loan, rendering the loan agreement usurious and void.', 'C', 'Usury Savings Clause', 'American Steel also argues that we should find the usury savings clause contained in the loan agreement to be enforceable and that, consequently, the savings clause in this case saves the loan from being usurious and void. Our recent pronouncement in NV One, LLC v. Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, 84 A.3d 800 (R.I. 2014) is entirely decisive as to that issue.14 As such, we simply reiterate our holding in that case: In the State of Rhode Island, in loan agreements such as the one at issue in the instant case, “usury savings clauses are unenforceable.” Id. at 810.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the loan agreement in the instant case was usurious and, therefore, void pursuant to § 6-26-2(a).', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

Specifically, the applicant asserts that: (1) the committee violated his due process rights by failing to provide him with adequate notice of the reasons for the recommendation of denial and failing to provide him with an adequate opportunity to respond to the charges against him; and (2) the committee failed to support its conclusions with sufficient and proper evidence.', 'This matter came before the Supreme Court on May 28, 2014 pursuant to an order directing the applicant to show cause why the recommendation of the committee should not be adopted. After considering the applicant’s written and oral submissions, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we adopt the recommendation of the committee.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Carlton Vose attended law school in the State of Florida after working as an officer of the Jacksonville County Sheriff’s Office. Mr. Vose filed a Petition/Questionnaire for Admission to', '-1- the Rhode Island Bar (the application) on May 14, 2010. Consistent with the practice for all applicants to the Rhode Island bar, Mr. Vose had an individual meeting with a member of the committee prior to taking the July 2010 bar examination. At this meeting, Mr. Vose was advised that, in the event that he passed the bar examination, he would have to go before the full committee to address two issues: (1) the recommendation of denial of his previous application to the Florida bar; and (2) his insufficient answer to a question on the Rhode Island application regarding the Florida proceedings. Mr. Vose passed the July 2010 bar examination and met with the full committee on April 7, 2011, December 9, 2011, December 16, 2011, December 21, 2011, and November 16, 2012.', 'Mr. Vose spent much of the April 7 and December 9 meetings exhaustively criticizing the findings of the Florida Board of Bar Examiners (the Florida board) and its recommendation that he be denied admission to the Florida bar. For example, Mr. Vose testified that his Florida application was denied because he “went to war” with the legal counsel to the Florida board. Mr. Vose also accused the legal counsel to the Florida board of giving false testimony, changing Mr. Vose’s testimony, and violating his due process rights. Mr. Vose expressed concerns about the sharing of information between the committee and the Florida board, at one point accusing the committee of violating its own rules with regard to the release of information and stating that he had “two Bar Associations working with each other against [him].”', 'At the end of the meeting on December 9, 2011, Mr. Vose told the committee that he wished to discuss something off the record. The committee then went off the record, and Mr. Vose told the committee that an unnamed lawyer had acted inappropriately toward a woman whom Mr. Vose had been dating, and that Mr. Vose had confronted the lawyer regarding this alleged conduct. At the end of these comments, Mr. Vose revealed that this unnamed lawyer', '-2- was also a member of the committee. 1 The committee excused Mr. Vose from the meeting and placed a summary of his off-the-record comments on the record. Mr. Vose had not previously raised this issue, and at no point during the proceedings did he move to recuse any committee member. In light of the seriousness of Mr. Vose’s off-the-record allegations, the committee decided to schedule another meeting for December 16, 2011 to further address the issue.', 'Between December 12 and December 14, the Clerk of the Court attempted to give Mr. Vose notice of the upcoming December 16 meeting by emailing him at the email address listed on his application, emailing him at his work email address, leaving him a voicemail, mailing a letter to his home address, and delivering a sealed letter by courier to his place of work. Mr. Vose resisted these notices by first failing to provide requested acknowledgment of receipt, and then by engaging in hostile email communications with the Clerk. Mr. Vose characterized the sealed letter that was delivered by courier to his place of work as a “note[] given to my co- workers,” told the Clerk that he would be deactivating his email address, and directed her to not contact him in any manner except by written communications sent to his home address.', 'At the December 16 meeting, the committee asked Mr. Vose to place on the record the comments he had made off the record on December 9. Mr. Vose told the committee that the lawyer with whom he had had the conflict was not a member of the committee, and he proceeded to restate his allegations that this person had acted inappropriately toward his ex-girlfriend. Mr. Vose expressed the belief that this lawyer was “putting up unusual resistance” to his application and characterized his disclosure as “making [the committee] aware of a conflict of interest.” Mr. Vose also addressed the Clerk’s attempts to give him notice of the December 16 meeting; his remarks were rude and unprofessional, included false accusations about the Clerk’s conduct, and, 1', 'The male members of the committee vociferously denied the accusations.', '-3- according to the committee, were expressed “using a tone of anger.” Regarding the alleged conduct of the courier, Mr. Vose stated: “the process server after he can’t find me * * * alerts people on every floor that the Rhode Island Supreme Court is looking for me, tells the final recipient that he has to open [the letter] and acknowledge acceptance of what’s inside, so one of my co-workers opens the letter and reads it.” 2', 'Mr. Vose requested a postponement of the proceedings until he could obtain legal counsel; the committee obliged his request and advised Mr. Vose that the next meeting would be scheduled for December 21, 2011. Mr. Vose appeared on December 21 without counsel and provided vague and defensive answers to the committee’s inquiries regarding his attempts to obtain legal representation.', 'On November 16, 2012, Mr. Vose, represented by counsel, had his final meeting with the committee, during which he again criticized the findings of the Florida board and presented reasons why, in his opinion, the Florida board’s recommendation was invalid. Among the issues discussed was a psychiatric evaluation that Mr. Vose underwent in connection with his application to the Florida bar. The psychiatrist had opined that Mr. Vose exhibited certain personality traits 3 but that he “can reason logically and has the ability to analyze legal problems and problems in general.” The psychiatrist further noted that “Mr. Vose would benefit from individual psychotherapy to address his anger and resentment about the events that have occurred since he became a [p]olice [o]fficer.” Mr. Vose told the committee that he had not sought individual psychotherapy, and that he viewed the diagnosed personality traits as a positive 2', 'The committee later confirmed with the courier company that the messenger had asked for Mr. Vose, was told he was out of the office, and that someone else signed on his behalf. According to the courier company, this person did not open or read the letter in the messenger’s presence. 3', 'The specific nature of the psychiatrist’s diagnosis was not relevant to the committee’s recommendation and will not be set forth herein.', '-4- attribute in the legal profession. At the outset of this final meeting, the committee again raised the issue of Mr. Vose’s prior representations regarding the lawyer with whom he had allegedly had a personal conflict, and Mr. Vose’s counsel asserted that he did not wish to move to recuse any members of the committee.', 'On June 11, 2013, the committee submitted a Recommendation of Denial of Admission to the Rhode Island Bar, supported by ten specific findings of fact:', '“1. Prior to Mr. Vose’s off-the-record comments at the', 'December 9, 2011 meeting, he never raised an alleged conflict of', 'interest or sought to recuse any members of the Committee.', '“2.

Mr. Vose’s failure to follow the psychiatric evaluation', 'suggestion that he undergo individual psychotherapy to address his', 'anger and resentment about certain events that occurred since he', 'became a police officer supports the Committee’s concern of how', 'Mr. Vose will react under adverse circumstances if he were', 'allowed to practice law, including rulings from courts or positions', 'taken by opposing counsel.”', 'On July 9, 2013, the committee received a letter from Mr. Vose indicating that he would not be withdrawing his application and that he was no longer represented by counsel. On September 5, 2013, this Court was advised by the committee that on July 11, 2013 the then-chair of the committee had received in the mail an anonymous letter from Boston, which contained threatening language regarding the disposition of Mr. Vose’s application. 4', 'On November 26, 2013, Mr. Vose filed a petition in opposition to the recommendation of the committee, in which he argued that the committee had violated his due process rights and based its findings on insufficient and improper evidence. The committee filed a response to Mr. Vose’s petition, asserting once again that Mr. Vose had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating his good moral character and fitness to practice law, and that the committee had provided him with notice and multiple opportunities to be heard. 4', 'This letter was not a factor in the committee’s recommendation of denial; the record does not indicate the identity of the letter’s author.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“We will not overturn a recommendation of this Court’s Committee on Character and Fitness * * * unless it has abused its discretion or its decision is clearly wrong.” In re Application of Webb, 58 A.3d 150, 154 (R.I. 2013) (quoting In re Application of Roots, 762 A.2d 1161, 1163 (R.I. 2000)). “We will do so, however, if such recommendation is not well founded.” Id.

Particularly, the committee found that Mr. Vose’s “December 9, 2011 off-the-record comments * * * constitute[d] an inappropriate and unethical threat that [was] inimical to the ethical requirements of a practicing lawyer in Rhode Island.” The committee further found that “Mr. Vose displayed a lack of candor with the Committee and a repeated lack of respect for authority figures that questions his ability to meet his professional responsibility and obligations as a lawyer.”', '-7-', 'In response, Mr. Vose argues that the committee conducted the proceedings in a manner that violated his due process rights. Mr. Vose asserts that the committee did not provide him “with notice of the nature of the evidence against him prior to [its] recommendation of denial” and that he “has not been provided with a sufficient formal adversarial hearing.” Next, Mr. Vose contends that the committee failed to support each of its ten factual findings with “legally sufficient evidence,” and that it considered improper evidence, namely, the findings of the Florida board. According to Mr. Vose, the committee “failed to meet its burden to further inquire into the findings regarding [his] previous denial of admission to the bar in Florida.”', 'Mr. Vose appears to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the application process laid out in Rule 3. The rule clearly states, and the committee repeatedly reminded Mr. Vose, that at all times he bore the burden of proving his character and fitness to practice law in the State of Rhode Island. While the United States Supreme Court has held that “the requirements of procedural due process must be met before a State can exclude a person from practicing law,” Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness, 373 U.S. 96, 102 (1963), this does not change the fact that the onus was on Mr. Vose, not the committee, to present clear and convincing evidence of his good moral character. The committee provided Mr. Vose with five hearings, during which he had the opportunity to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, and to respond to the committee’s questions. Throughout the meetings, the committee informed Mr. Vose of its concerns regarding his character and asked him specific questions relating to these areas of concern. After reviewing the record of these proceedings, we are convinced that the committee has done nothing to impinge on Mr. Vose’s due process rights.', 'Likewise, we are of the opinion that the committee’s findings regarding Mr. Vose’s character were well-founded and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The committee’s ten', '-8- findings of fact clearly are supported by the record of these proceedings; the transcripts of the meetings and the tone of his written filings reveal that Mr. Vose has continually treated the committee with hostility and contempt. Mr. Vose’s off-the-record comments made on December 9, 2011 are particularly concerning. The manner of the disclosure—waiting until the end of the second meeting and asking to speak off the record—indicates that Mr. Vose intended to threaten the committee with the release of embarrassing information rather than present a legitimate conflict-of-interest issue.', 'Additionally, the committee was within its discretion to consider the findings of the Florida board in determining whether Mr. Vose possessed the requisite character and fitness to be admitted to the bar in Rhode Island. Other jurisdictions have recognized the propriety of considering an applicant’s denial from the bar of another state. See, e.g., Hawai’i Board of Bar Examiners Rules of Procedure Pt. 2, § 2.6(c)(10); Minnesota Rules for Admission to the Bar 5(B)(3)(l); New Mexico Rules Governing Admission to the Bar 15-103(C)(3)(k); In re Bar Admission of Vanderperren, 661 N.W.2d 27, 41 (Wis. 2003). Here, the committee properly treated the Florida board’s findings as a cause for further inquiry; as the meetings progressed, the findings of the Florida board proved to be quite relevant as they mirrored the committee’s own increasing concerns regarding Mr. Vose’s character. 5', 'Furthermore, Mr. Vose’s petition in opposition to the recommendation of the committee clearly illustrates his hostile attitude and lack of candor. Mr. Vose accuses the committee of 5', 'During the hearing before this Court, Mr. Vose represented that his application for admission to the Florida bar remained pending before the Florida Supreme Court. In its supplemental filing with this Court, the committee filed an order, issued by the Florida Supreme Court, more than one month before this hearing, denying his application for admission to the Florida bar. In his objection to the committee’s motion to supplement the record, Mr. Vose asserts that, at the time of the hearing before this Court, he had “no knowledge of the [o]rder issued by the Florida Supreme Court.”', '-9- “knowingly provid[ing] false information to [this Court]” and characterizes the committee’s findings as “an angry and unsupported attack on [his] character.” Mr. Vose also accuses the committee of falsely summarizing his December 9, 2011 off-the-record comments 6 and of fabricating the anonymous letter received by the chairwoman on July 11, 2013, as part of what he considers a “conspiracy to defame [his] character.” Additionally, Mr. Vose asserts that he has “been practicing law in Providence Superior Court since 2010”; the committee, upon investigating this assertion, found that Mr. Vose appeared as a pro se litigant in a single case that was filed in 2009. These examples clearly demonstrate that the committee did not err in finding that Mr. Vose lacks the qualities of trustworthiness, honesty, and judgment that are required for the practice of law in Rhode Island.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, the applicant’s petition for admission to the bar of this state is hereby denied. 6', 'In his letter in response to the committee’s recommendation, Mr. Vose indicated that he had made a voice recording of his December 9, 2011 off-the-record comments. Although he appears to dispute the accuracy of the committee’s summary of his comments, Mr. Vose has not attempted to produce this alleged recording and, further, has stated at oral argument before this Court that there was no recording.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'In re Application of Carlton Vose.

The plaintiff Coogan is employed as a driver for United Parcel Service (UPS). 1 Sometime in the afternoon of June 29, Coogan delivered a package to 113 Bates Trail in West Greenwich, Rhode 1', 'The facts in this section have been culled from the parties’ depositions, interrogatories, and affidavits submitted to the Superior Court on the motion for summary judgment.', '-1- Island, the residence of defendants, Cheryl and Mark Nelson. Although Coogan was familiar with Bates Trail from previous deliveries, he could not recall having ever previously delivered a package to this particular residence. On parking his vehicle, plaintiff stated, he beeped his horn and called out “UPS” in order to alert people that he was coming onto the property. He then made the delivery to the front door, rang the doorbell, and then walked away.', 'The defendant, Cheryl Nelson (Nelson), 2 stated that, upon hearing the doorbell, she opened the front door and saw plaintiff’s back as he stepped off the deck onto the driveway. At the time, Nelson was accompanied by two of her dogs, a German shepherd by the name of Sammy and a rat terrier named Gizmo.', 'When he heard the door open, plaintiff turned around to see two dogs “charging [him].” He could hear defendant yelling but could not hear what she was saying over the noise of the dogs barking. Being nervous that he was going to be bitten, he tried to defend himself with a plastic device, which is used to record information about deliveries. Coogan described the device as being a “pretty hard, sturdy piece of plastic,” about the size of an average laptop screen. Coogan stated that he was backing up while the dogs were circling him and that, at some point when he was in the driveway, approximately thirty yards away from his truck, he was bitten on the left forearm and the right leg. Although he was not certain which dog bit him, Nelson identified the dog that bit Coogan as being Gizmo, after that dog was hit by Coogan’s “clipboard.” 3', 'After being bitten, plaintiff and defendant had a brief interaction, in which Coogan asked why Nelson had let the dogs out, to which Nelson responded that the dogs would have gotten out 2', 'Although Mark Nelson is also named as a defendant in this case, he was not present for the incident. 3', 'Nelson stated that to the best of her knowledge, both bites were on Coogan’s arm.', '-2- anyway, through the “doggy door” that comes out from the basement into the yard. 4 Afterwards, plaintiff drove back to the UPS office, where he filled out an incident report, and then was referred 5 to the Kent County Memorial Hospital, where he received stitches for the bite on his arm and treatment for what he described as “an inch laceration” on his knee. The plaintiff was given a prescription for pain medication and did not resume full duty at work until sometime after the stitches were removed on July 10.', 'The plaintiff filed the instant complaint in the Providence County Superior Court on January 27, 2010, alleging personal injuries as a result of defendants’ negligence in failing to secure their dogs. On July 10, 2012, the Nelsons filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff had failed to prove that defendants had any knowledge of a vicious propensity on the part of the dog that bit him, while in the enclosure of defendants’ property. 6 See Montiero v. Silver Lake I, L.P., 813 A.2d 978, 981 (R.I. 2003). In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants attached two affidavits, one from Cheryl Nelson and the other from Wendy Tavares, the animal control officer for the Town of West Greenwich. The Nelson affidavit stated that neither Sammy nor Gizmo had ever bitten anyone or showed vicious propensities prior to June 29, 2009. The Nelson affidavit further explained that there had been one prior incident involving Gizmo that occurred in November 2000 when defendants’ then-three-year-old son was playing with Gizmo and was scratched. The defendant took her son to the emergency room as 4', 'There appears to be some confusion in the record as to whether the basement “doggy door” exits onto the front yard or the backyard. In her deposition, Nelson stated that the “doggy door” exited onto the front yard but her answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories indicated that the “doggy door” exited into the backyard. In any event, the record is clear that Coogan ventured onto defendants’ property without seeing the “doggy door.” 5', 'Coogan originally went to Concentra Medical Center with a supervisor from UPS but, because of the depth of the wound, Concentra referred plaintiff to Kent County Memorial Hospital for treatment. 6', '“This knowledge requirement is commonly referred to as the ‘one-bite rule.’” Montiero v. Silver Lake I, L.P., 813 A.2d 978, 981 (R.I. 2003).', '-3- the scratch was near his eye, and the incident was duly reported to the West Greenwich Police Department. The Tavares affidavit confirmed that the West Greenwich Police Department was notified in November 2000 of a “dog bite incident” and, upon going to the residence to see the child and the dog, observed that the incident was not a dog bite but a scratch on the nose. The incident report noted that the wound was a “deep scratch” on the child’s nose and that the “[d]og was placed under strict confinement for 10 days” as a result. Thereafter, the incident was deemed “closed.”', 'The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motion for summary judgment and the matter was heard on November 27, 2012. At the hearing, plaintiff noted that he had requested a continuance to give him time to obtain the Kent County Memorial Hospital records of the November 2000 incident. The hearing justice questioned whether plaintiff, as a UPS driver, should “expect dogs on a property,” stating that dogs might be characterized as “part of the hazard of the profession[.]”', 'The hearing justice stated that “[t]he real issue is whether this dog had a propensity for biting people,” and noted that “[t]here is no one-scratch rule[;] there is a one-bite rule.”', 'The hearing justice found that “plaintiff was clearly within the enclosure of the defendant’s property,” and that “there is no genuine issue of material fact * * * about whether the defendant knew of the dog’s vicious propensity.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Final judgment entered in defendants’ favor on November 28, 2012. The plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court.', 'The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion with this Court to supplement the record on appeal to include the records from Kent County Memorial Hospital relative to the November 2000 incident involving defendants’ son and Gizmo. This Court granted plaintiff’s motion in an order entered on December 17, 2013. The plaintiff’s supplemental documents include a registration', '-4- record from Kent County Memorial Hospital of defendants’ son for a “dog bite to face” and a nursing record initial assessment, citing the chief complaint as “cuts to face” after being “bit by dog.” The plaintiff also submitted an Emergency Physician Record, subtitled “Animal Bite,” which indicates a bite injury to the face received while “playing with or teasing animal,” and identifies the animal as a “rat terrier.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a trial justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.” Swain v. Estate of Tyre, 57 A.3d 283, 288 (R.I. 2012). We apply the same standards and rules used by the trial justice. See Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013). In addition, this Court has stated that “[s]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” NV One, LLC v. Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, 84 A.3d 800, 805 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Carreiro v. Tobin, 66 A.3d 820, 822 (R.I. 2013)). Accordingly, in deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Beauregard v. Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 493 (R.I. 2013). “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any, and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Swain, 57 A.3d at 288 (quoting Beacon Mutual Insurance Co. v. Spino Brothers, Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 648 (R.I. 2011)).', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Whether the Incident Occurred Within the Dog Owner’s Enclosure', 'In this case, we once again visit the well-traveled legal terrain of dog bite cases. These past cases have established our well-settled law regarding liability for acts of animal aggression, most commonly involving dogs. See Carreiro, 66 A.3d at 822 (“Liability for acts of canine aggression is well settled in Rhode Island.”). General Laws 1956 § 4-13-16 imposes strict liability on dog owners if a dog “assaults, bites, or otherwise injures any person while traveling the highway or out of the enclosure of the owner or keeper of that dog * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Strict liability does not apply, however, if the act occurred within the dog owner’s enclosure. See Carreiro, 66 A.3d at 822-23. Accordingly, as this Court has acknowledged, “[p]recisely where the dog bite took place * * * can be outcome-determinative.” Id. at 823.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice was clearly wrong in finding that the incident occurred within the dog owner’s enclosure because the record indicates that defendants’ residence had no fence, wall, or other tangible boundary. The defendants contend that Coogan’s actions in beeping his horn and yelling out “UPS” in order to alert residents that he had entered onto the property indicate that he knew he was entering onto property where there might be a dog.', 'We begin with a brief discussion of what constitutes an enclosure under § 4-13-16. In answering this question, “there is a dog-eared decision from 1936 that gives us clear guidance.” Carreiro, 66 A.3d at 823. In that decision, Wilbur v. Gross, 55 R.I. 473, 182 A. 597 (1936), this Court conducted an exhaustive analysis of the term “enclosure” for purposes of determining', '-6- liability for dog bites. This Court concluded that the central factor in the definition of an enclosure was “that there be something to give a man reasonable notice that he is entering upon occupied premises, where there may be a dog.” Id. at 477, 182 A. at 599. More recently, we have defined an enclosure under § 4-13-16 as “a fence, physical obstruction or any other condition that gives reasonable notice to third parties that the area is private.” Montiero, 813 A.2d at 981. On the other hand, “an individual who seeks canine companionship but at the same time fears litigation need not live in a residence which is completely encircled with such medieval trimmings as a moat or fortress-like walls.” Bernhart v. Nine, 120 R.I. 692, 698, 391 A.2d 75, 78 (1978).', 'In any event, we do not need to definitively answer the question of whether the dog bite in the instant case occurred within the enclosure. As this Court has stated, “the ‘purpose of the summary judgment procedure is issue finding, not issue determination.’” DeMaio v. Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 130 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 391 (R.I. 2008)). We must only determine whether the evidence in the record showed that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether defendants’ driveway constitutes an enclosure for purposes of the statute.', 'The evidence in the record indicated that the premises were not marked by any fence, wall, or other tangible boundary. We are of the opinion that this is sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff was within an enclosure at the time he was bitten. We emphasize that the existence of an enclosure for purposes of § 4-13-16 will usually be a fact-intensive inquiry. This Court was recently asked to consider whether one apartment within a multi-family apartment house was a “separate enclosure” from another apartment in the house. See Carreiro, 66 A.3d at 824. We concluded that, “[a]bsent an inquiry into whether the', '-7- second-floor apartment was kept locked and whether [the] defendant was excluded from the premises, it [wa]s impossible to determine whether the second-floor apartment was a separate enclosure” and that it was a “disputed question of material fact * * *.” Id. Similarly, we are of the opinion that whether the driveway of defendants’ unfenced yard should be considered to be within defendants’ enclosure was a question of material fact that should be determined by a factfinder.', 'B', 'Whether Defendants Knew of the Dog’s Dangerous Propensities', 'Even assuming, arguendo, that the hearing justice correctly determined that plaintiff was within the enclosure of defendants’ property for purposes of § 4-13-16, we conclude that summary judgment in this case was improvidently granted.', 'Under our common law, a dog owner may be held liable for a dog bite occurring within the dog owner’s enclosure if the plaintiff can “prove that the defendant knew about the dog’s vicious propensities.” Carreiro, 66 A.3d at 822-23 (quoting DuBois v. Quilitzsch, 21 A.3d 375, 380 (R.I. 2011)). This knowledge, or scienter, requirement is commonly called the “one-bite rule.” See DuBois, 21 A.3d at 380. 7', 'The plaintiff contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants knew of any dangerous propensities of the rat terrier, Gizmo, based on the November 2000 incident when defendants’ young son was scratched on the nose. The defendants argue that 7', 'At oral argument, plaintiff also appeared to be arguing that the dog should not be given the benefit of the “one-bite rule” in this case because plaintiff was bitten in the course of his duties as a UPS delivery man. To the extent that plaintiff bases his argument on some special exception to be applied to him because of his profession, we note that this Court has previously addressed the question of making an exception to the “one-bite rule” to impose liability on dog owners when the injured person is an invitee and stated that “the common-law one-bite rule applies notwithstanding the injured person’s status as an invitee.” DuBois v. Quilitzsch, 21 A.3d 375, 381 (R.I. 2011).', '-8- the November 2000 incident involved only “an inadvertent scratch” which does not rise to the level of the one-bite requirement. Moreover, defendants emphasize that plaintiff was unable to identify which dog bit him and, consequently, could not establish that the same dog was involved in the November 2000 incident.', 'Although it would have been helpful for the hearing justice to have had the Kent County Memorial Hospital records that were ultimately filed with us, we believe that the evidence before the hearing justice at the time was sufficient to support a finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to defendants’ knowledge of whether Gizmo had dangerous tendencies. Consequently, we do not believe it necessary to consider those records and will limit our analysis to the evidence the trial justice had at the time, i.e., the affidavits from Nelson and from the animal control officer for the Town of West Greenwich.', 'The affidavits included a copy of the incident report filed at the West Greenwich police station, identifying the incident as a “dog bite.” The incident report clarified that “the wound was not a bite but a deep scratch on childs [sic] nose.” We are of the opinion that this evidence was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this prior act indicated a vicious or dangerous propensity on the part of Gizmo and whether defendants knew or should have known of this vicious propensity. See Ferrara ex rel. Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Social Services v. Marra, 823 A.2d 1134, 1138 (R.I. 2003) (“[T]he existence of the police report was enough evidence to raise a question of material fact about [the defendant’s] knowledge of the vicious propensities of at least one of the dogs. Consequently, the question of [the] defendant’s knowledge should have been resolved by a finder of fact after a trial on the merits * * *.”). We emphasize that, in a motion for summary judgment, a trial justice is required to view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to', '-9- the nonmoving party. See Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 126-27 (R.I. 2012). Moreover, we note that, as a general matter, summary judgment is rarely appropriate when the issue revolves around the existence of any particular state of mind, such as a defendant’s subjective knowledge of a dog’s vicious propensities. Cf. 27A Federal Procedure, § 62:671 at 422 (Lawyers Ed. 1996) (“[W]hether as a matter of fact any particular state of mind exists can seldom be considered to be beyond reasonable dispute because this depends entirely upon the conflicting inferences to be drawn from evidence so likely to be circumstantial or, if direct, self- serving.”). In viewing the evidence of this case in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that the prior incident involving Gizmo could permit a factfinder to conclude that Gizmo did have a vicious propensity and that defendants knew of it.', 'Furthermore, we note that the hearing justice appears to have misunderstood the requirements of the “one-bite rule” in stating that “[t]here is no one-scratch rule[;] there is a one- bite rule.” The so-called “one-bite rule” is only a convenient shorthand expression which courts have adopted to describe the knowledge requirement of a prior incident involving a dog to indicate a vicious propensity. This Court has never stated that the only type of prior incident which would suffice to indicate a dog’s vicious propensity is restricted to a bite. Indeed, we emphasize that the pertinent language of § 4-13-16 imposes liability when a dog “assaults, bites, or otherwise injures any person.” (Emphases added.) We are of the opinion that other kinds of canine behavior that might cause injury to persons may clearly indicate a dog’s vicious propensities. In this case, the evidence indicated that Gizmo had been involved in a prior incident that resulted in a “deep scratch” on a child’s nose. A determination of whether the incident rose to the level of a vicious propensity was one that should properly have been made by a finder of fact after a trial. We emphasize that, in coming to this conclusion, we make no final', '- 10 - determination that Gizmo did, in fact, have vicious propensities or as to the defendants’ ultimate liability for the plaintiff’s injuries. That ultimate determination is not before us nor was it properly before the hearing justice on a motion for summary judgment. See Mitchell v. Mitchell, 756 A.2d 179, 185 (R.I. 2000) (“The function of the motion justice considering a proposed summary-judgment motion is not to cull out the weak cases from the herd of lawsuits waiting to be tried. Rather, only if the case is legally dead on arrival should the court take the drastic step of administering last rites by granting summary judgment.”).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 2, 2011, a drive-by shooting occurred near the intersection of Camp Street and Doyle Avenue in Providence. Subsequently, on August 5, 2011, the state filed a multi-count criminal information charging defendant and a codefendant, Jean Sajous, in connection with that', '-1- shooting.1 On May 18, 2012, the state filed a second criminal information against defendant charging him with additional crimes relating to the May 2 shooting incident. Prior to trial, the state dismissed several of the counts against defendant that had been charged in the two criminal informations; and the trial justice consolidated for trial the remaining counts in the two cases stemming from the two separate informations. A trial was held in June of 2012 with respect to the following charges: carrying a handgun in a motor vehicle without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); operating a motor vehicle in an attempt to elude the police in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-4; discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle with a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury in violation of § 11-47-51.1; conspiracy to discharge a firearm from a motor vehicle in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; using a firearm while committing a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b); driving with a suspended license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18; and solicitation in violation of § 11-1-9. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that, on May 2, 2011, defendant did not have a duly issued license or permit to carry or possess a pistol. We summarize below the salient aspects of what occurred at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Officer David Lorince', 'Providence Police Officer David Lorince testified for the state. He stated that, on May 2, 2011, Officer Donald Castigliego and he had been driving in their patrol car on Camp Street 1', 'On February 6, 2012, Jean Sajous pled nolo contendere to the following offenses stemming from the drive-by shooting: carrying a handgun in a motor vehicle without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; conspiracy to discharge a firearm from a motor vehicle in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle with a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury in violation of § 11-47-51.1. On each of those counts, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment, which sentences were to run concurrently. Mr. Sajous also pled nolo contendere to one count of using a firearm while committing a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b); with respect to that count, Mr. Sajous received a ten-year suspended sentence, with probation. A judgment to that effect was entered on February 22, 2012.', '-2- headed towards Doyle Avenue when he observed a dark-colored Nissan Maxima turn onto Doyle Avenue. Officer Lorince testified that, approximately ten to fifteen seconds later, he “observed a single gunshot out of the passenger side of [the] Maxima.” According to Officer Lorince, the occupants of the Maxima then fled the scene; he added that Officer Castigliego activated the patrol car’s lights and sirens and that the two officers “gave chase to the vehicle.”', 'Officer Lorince testified that the Maxima drove through the intersection of Doyle Avenue and North Main Street and continued onto Randall Street, at which point it “skidded and hit [a] utility pole.” He stated that, as their patrol car was pulling up alongside the passenger’s side of the Maxima, two individuals exited the vehicle. At trial, Officer Lorince identified defendant as the individual who exited from the driver’s side, and he stated that he later learned that the individual who exited from the passenger’s side was Mr. Sajous. It was Officer Lorince’s testimony that, as Mr. Sajous exited the Maxima, he “was holding his waist like he was holding something or his pants were going to fall off when he ran.”2 Officer Lorince testified that he then pursued both individuals on foot and that, assisted by additional officers who had responded to the scene, he apprehended them in the parking lot of a nearby Marriott Hotel. Officer Lorince further testified that, after the two individuals were arrested, the police found a firearm in a trash can which Officer Lorince had seen Mr. Sajous run past during the chase; he acknowledged, however, that he had not seen defendant pass that same trash can while he was being chased. 2', 'The testimony of Providence Police Officer Donald Castigliego with respect to what occurred on the evening of May 2, 2011 was largely consistent with that of Officer Lorince. Notably, Officer Castigliego testified that, as Mr. Sajous was exiting the vehicle, “he was clutching his waist as if he was concealing something;” Officer Castigliego added that, based on his training and experience, he believed that the “something” could be a “firearm or a weapon.”', '-3-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Det. Paul Renzi', 'Detective Paul Renzi of the Providence Police Department’s Bureau of Criminal Identification testified that, on May 2, 2011, he responded to a crime scene at the Marriott Hotel in Providence. He stated that, when he arrived at the hotel, his “attention was directed to the rear of the Marriott to a trash can which was being watched over by a patrolman * * * .” He testified that in that trash can he observed a pistol which had been placed inside of a black sock, with the barrel sticking out of the sock. Detective Renzi further testified that he fingerprinted the firearm, the magazine, and a spent cartridge casing; he acknowledged, however, that, “[b]ecause of [the] sock,” he was not able to recover any fingerprints. The exhibits at trial indicated that the serial number of the gun recovered from the trash can matched that of a gun purchased by one Ronique Perou (to whose testimony we turn next).', 'C', 'The Testimony of Ronique Perou', 'Ronique Perou testified that, having previously obtained a gun permit, she purchased her first gun on April 12, 2011 at a store in Woonsocket called “Bullseye.”', 'Ms. Perou testified that she had met defendant and Mr. Sajous (whom she referred to as “Beans”) approximately three years prior to trial. With respect to her relationship with the two men, she further testified that she had seen defendant visiting the home of a friend of his which was close to where she lived in Providence and that she and defendant had exchanged greetings on several occasions. Ms. Perou stated that, in late April of 2011, defendant came to her home, where he observed an empty box of bullets; she added that, when defendant asked her if she had', '-4- a gun, she told him that she did. She testified that shortly thereafter, on May 2, 2011,3 defendant again visited her home, where she showed him her gun upon his request; she added, however, that, when he asked her if he could borrow her gun, she refused. It was Ms. Perou’s further testimony that defendant then asked her if she could “get [him] one” because, as he informed her, he would not be able to obtain a gun permit due to a previous arrest. She stated that she assented to defendant’s suggestion that she use her permit to purchase a gun and have it “transfer[red] to his name.”', 'Ms. Perou testified that, later that same day (May 2), she drove defendant to the Woonsocket gun store called Bullseye. She further testified that they went into the store together and that defendant gave her one hundred dollars. It was her testimony that she filled out the paperwork relative to the gun purchase, listing herself as the actual buyer of the firearm. She stated that she used the money given to her by defendant to place a deposit on the gun, which could be picked up after a seven-day waiting period.4', 'According to Ms. Perou, she and defendant then returned to her home, where defendant asked her if he could see her gun again.5 Ms. Perou testified that, when she showed defendant 3', 'The reader will recall that the shooting that is at the center of this case occurred on May 2, 2011. 4', 'Ronique Perou testified that, with respect to the trip to the gun store to purchase a second firearm, she was charged by the state with one count of providing false information in securing a firearm in violation of § 11-47-23; it was her testimony that she pled guilty to that charge after entering into a cooperation agreement with the state. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Ms. Perou agreed to testify truthfully with respect to the events of May 2, 2011 in exchange for the state’s recommendation that she receive a suspended five-year sentence, with probation. In addition, Ms. Perou acknowledged that, “as part of [her] agreement with the State, [she was] promised that [she] would not be prosecuted by the Federal Government[.]” 5', 'The reader will recall that Ms. Perou had previously purchased a gun on April 12, 2011— which gun is not to be confused with the gun on which she made a deposit on May 2, 2011. The gun purchased in April of 2011 is the one that is at issue in this case.', '-5- her gun, he asked her if he could take it to show to a friend of his. She stated that she told defendant no, but that he then grabbed the gun from her hand and departed. Ms. Perou testified that she followed defendant outside, where he told her that he was not going to do anything with the gun other than show it to a friend; she added that he drove away from her home in a “[b]lack Maxima” that was waiting outside. Ms. Perou testified that she then tried calling defendant by phone but that she was not able to reach him until later that day, at which point he assured her that nothing would happen with her gun. According to Ms. Perou, the next day she attempted unsuccessfully to locate defendant’s friend “Beans” so that he could help her locate defendant.', 'Ms. Perou stated that, on May 4, 2011, she filed a report with the Providence Police Department alleging that the gun had been stolen; she added that, because she did not want to get “in trouble,” she told the police that someone had broken into her home and had stolen the gun. On cross-examination, Ms. Perou acknowledged that, when agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) first questioned her on June 23, 2011, she gave a recorded statement repeating in substance her statement to the Providence Police Department. (That was the first of four recorded statements that Ms. Perou made to ATF that day.) Ms. Perou further testified at trial that, after becoming somewhat “scared” when the ATF agents told her that they thought she was lying to them and that, if she was lying, they would charge her with a crime, she gave a second recorded statement; in that statement she told the ATF agents that her gun could have been stolen by defendant, by “Beans,” or by a third man who wore “braids”—in view of the fact that all three of them had been at her home for a party in April. She stated that the ATF agents again told her that they thought she was lying and that, if she was not telling the truth, she would be charged with a crime; and she acknowledged that the ATF agents also told her that they believed defendant had taken the gun and that she was trying', '-6- to protect him. Ms. Perou testified that, after listening to those statements by the ATF agents, she gave a third recorded statement, in which she admitted that defendant had taken the gun from her. She further testified that she also told the ATF agents about having gone with defendant to purchase a gun for him.6 Ms. Perou also stated that several months later, on February 9, 2012, she was again interviewed by the ATF agents, at which time she told them that defendant had not taken her gun until approximately two to three days after she had gone to the gun store with him—which contrasted with her trial testimony that defendant had taken her gun that same day, May 2, 2011. At trial, Ms. Perou explained that she made the February 9, 2012 statement only because the ATF agents told her that defendant could not have taken her gun on May 2.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Paul Connolly', 'Paul Connolly, the owner of Bullseye Shooting Supply in Woonsocket, testified that he was familiar with Ms. Perou because she had purchased firearms from his store, whereas he stated that he did not recognize defendant. At trial, he identified a form that Ms. Perou had filled out on May 2, 2011 in connection with her purchase of a firearm (which would have been her second firearm); and he further testified that she came into the store by herself on that date. It was Mr. Connolly’s testimony that he had previously refused to sell firearms to customers whom he suspected of attempting to make a “straw purchase,” and he stated that he would not have sold the firearm to Ms. Perou if, when she was filling out the just-referenced form, “there was another gentleman standing with her that then gave her $100 to pay for that firearm * * * .” 6', 'Although Ms. Perou testified that she gave a fourth recorded statement to the ATF agents on June 23, 2011, she did not testify with specificity as to the contents thereof.', '-7-', 'Mr. Connolly acknowledged that, in October of 2011, ATF agents came to his store and asked him questions about purchases made there; he stated that he “cooperated with them.” He also stated that he “do[es] everything [he] can to assist law enforcement * * * .”', 'E', 'The Verdict, the Motion for a New Trial, and the Sentencing', 'After the parties had rested, the trial justice instructed the jury. On June 12, 2012, the jury convicted defendant of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license and attempting to elude a police officer, while it acquitted him of the remaining charges.7', 'The defendant then moved for a new trial with respect to both convictions pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice granted the motion for a new trial on the charge of attempting to elude a police officer, but he denied defendant’s motion with respect to the charge of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license.8 In due course, the trial justice sentenced defendant to seven years imprisonment, with eighteen months to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. A timely appeal was filed.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice should have granted his motion for a new trial as to the charge of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license because, in his view, there was no evidence that he was aware that his codefendant was in possession of a gun until the gun was fired on Doyle Avenue. 7', 'After both parties had rested, the trial justice dismissed the charge of driving with a suspended license, leaving six counts to go to the jury (see infra). 8', 'In ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice ruled that, based on the evidence presented at trial, a fair inference could be drawn that defendant had sole possession of the firearm at issue in this case when he entered the vehicle on May 2, 2011. It follows from that ruling that the trial justice concluded that the jury had an adequate evidentiary basis on which to convict defendant of possession of a firearm in the motor vehicle—despite the fact that Mr. Sajous had pled nolo contendere to discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle on the day in question.', '-8-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When a trial justice considers a motion for a new trial, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

In fulfilling his or her role as the thirteenth juror, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v.

The record indicates that the trial justice first properly considered the evidence in light of the jury charge. Moving next to the second step, the trial justice proceeded to independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. With respect to the credibility of Ms. Perou, the trial justice stated as follows:', '“I recognize that Miss Perou [gave] inconsistent statements, but', 'I’m satisfied that as she went through the testimony, she did', 'explain why they were inconsistent, and when she got to the', 'bottom line, it was clear to me, as a front-row observer, of', 'watching her and listening to her, that her inconsistent statements', 'were really borne [sic] of a concern for her own situation with', 'immigration or with the ATF. She didn’t want to get herself in', 'trouble. She obviously didn’t want to get [defendant] in trouble', 'either, at least not at first.”', '- 10 - In contrast, the trial justice found Mr. Connolly to be an “overearnest witness looking too hard to please law enforcement, particularly the ATF.” The trial justice further found that Ms. Perou’s testimony “reflected * * * defendant’s clear desire to get his hands on a handgun,” and he stated that he had “no difficulty in accepting her rendition that it was [defendant] who had [her] gun and introduced that gun into the vehicle that night.” Based on the evidence presented at trial, it was the opinion of the trial justice that a fair inference could be drawn that, when defendant entered the vehicle, he had sole possession of the firearm at issue in this case; and, although he noted that, “at one point, [Mr.] Sajous picked it up and used it,” he found that “the gun was shared by both of them that night.” The trial justice then concluded, pursuant to the third step in the analytical process, that he would have reached the same result as the jury, stating:', '“I’m well satisfied that * * * defendant was properly convicted', 'beyond a reasonable doubt of unlawfully carrying a firearm in a', 'motor vehicle without a duly-issued license or permit * * * .” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to that charge. See State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011) (stating that if, after conducting the required three-step analysis, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, “then the inquiry is at an end and the motion for a new trial should be denied”).', 'The defendant contends that, without the testimony of Ms. Perou, whose testimony he asserts was lacking in credibility, “[t]here was absolutely no evidence of any statements or conversations which indicated [that the defendant had actual possession of the gun or] that [he] was aware that [Mr.] Sajous possessed a gun prior to [Mr.] Sajous’ discharge of the weapon.” After a careful review of the record in this case, it is clear to us that the defendant’s contention on appeal amounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. See State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96,', '- 11 - 103 (R.I. 2012) (stating that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clay, 79 A.3d at 842; State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011). The trial justice recognized that Ms. Perou had given inconsistent statements to the police and the ATF; however, he was satisfied by her explanation as to why she had done so, and he ultimately chose to accept her in-court testimony with respect to the events of May 2, 2011. We have stated on more than one occasion that “the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948-49. We are unable to conclude that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was clearly wrong in crediting Ms. Perou’s testimony that the defendant had taken her handgun. See Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (“[T]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010).

21,: v. : Brian Cavanaugh. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Brian Cavanaugh, has appealed from an order of the Chief Judge of the Family Court affirming the entry of an order by a magistrate of the Family Court restraining and enjoining him from contacting his former wife, Rosanna Cavanaugh (the plaintiff). It is the contention of the defendant that the magistrate’s issuance of a civil restraining order was not authorized by G.L. 1956 chapter 15 of title 15, which chapter is entitled “Domestic Abuse Prevention.” This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 10, 2012, plaintiff filed a complaint in Family Court seeking protection from abuse pursuant to chapter 15 of title 15 of the General Laws. In that complaint, plaintiff alleged that she “suffered abuse when the defendant” “[p]laced [her] in fear of imminent physical harm” and engaged in “Stalking, Cyberstalking, [and/or] Harassing.” In support of her complaint, plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that she was in fear of defendant because of his “persistent threatening, swearing, and menacing behavior during pick-up/drop-off times [when they would exchange their child] and phone calls.”', 'She asked the court to enjoin defendant “from contacting, assaulting, molesting, or otherwise interfering with [her] * * * .”', 'An ex parte “Temporary Order [for] Protection from Abuse” was entered that same day. The Family Court specified, inter alia, in the order that defendant may contact plaintiff to facilitate visitation and that the exchange of their child (over whom the parties had shared physical custody) should occur at either the North Smithfield, Rhode Island or Franklin, Massachusetts police stations.1', 'A', 'The Hearing on Plaintiff’s Complaint for Protection from Abuse', 'On October 19, 2012, a hearing was held on plaintiff’s complaint for protection from abuse before a magistrate of the Family Court, at which plaintiff and defendant both testified.', '1. The Testimony of Plaintiff', 'At the hearing, plaintiff testified that she and defendant had formerly been married but that they had divorced in 2011. She further stated that there was one child born of that marriage. 1', 'At the time of the hearing before the Chief Judge, it was made clear on the record that plaintiff is from North Smithfield, Rhode Island and that defendant is from Franklin, Massachusetts.', '-2- The plaintiff testified with respect to multiple occasions in the past when defendant had “yelled,” “screamed,” and sworn at her and had placed her “in fear of bodily harm;”2 she added that she was “very scared” because that type of conduct on the part of defendant—which she alleged occurred “all the time”—had been “escalat[ing].”', 'It was plaintiff’s testimony that, in August of 2012, her relationship with defendant worsened due to her having filed a motion to modify their child’s visitation schedule (which motion was dismissed by the Family Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on August 9). The plaintiff then proceeded to testify with respect to three specific phone calls made by defendant to her after the dismissal of that motion. The plaintiff testified that, on the day her motion was dismissed, she received a phone call from defendant, who, in a “gruff, seething kind of tone of voice,” said to her: “[A]re, you going to keep f*** with me now?” The plaintiff then testified that, sometime after that, defendant had called her to “gloat,” stating: “Don’t ‘F’ with me and my lawyers.” She further testified that, on August 10, 2012, when she was en route to meet defendant so that she could pick up their son pursuant to a coparenting agreement, defendant called her on the phone and said: “So, you’re going to stop talking, you know, s*** about me. Do you understand?” She stated that, because she became “really * * * scared” as a result of that phone call, she called the police in Franklin; she added that an officer then escorted her to the place where she would pick up the child. The plaintiff explained that, following that incident, she filed the complaint for protection from abuse. When asked whether there were any other incidents that placed her “in fear of [defendant] or in fear of bodily harm,” she replied in the affirmative. She testified that, during the divorce proceedings, defendant threatened to 2', 'The plaintiff conceded on cross-examination that none of defendant’s statements constituted explicit threats against her physical well-being; however, she testified that defendant would “lean[] in and yell[]” at her and would “use[] his physique to * * * be threatening” when speaking to her.', '-3- “throw [her] cats in the pound” and “trashed” her piano; she added that, in May of 2012, defendant “threw something at [her].”', '2. The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant testified on his own behalf.', 'He acknowledged that there had been arguments between plaintiff and him before and after their divorce was finalized and that he had resorted to vulgarity during those arguments. He admitted that, following the dismissal of plaintiff’s motion to modify the visitation schedule, he had called plaintiff to “gloat[]” and that he had used the “F” word during that phone call. He also testified that, during the August 10 phone call testified to by plaintiff, he told her to “stop making up lies about [him].” It was his testimony that, after that call, plaintiff called the police and that an officer had been present the next time the parties exchanged their son. The defendant acknowledged that his swearing at plaintiff in the midst of a phone call constituted “harassment,” but he asserted that she had been “harassing [him] as well.”', '3. The Decision of the Family Court Magistrate', 'After the testimony was heard, the magistrate rendered a decision from the bench. She found that “this case [was] a case that sound[ed] in * * * harassment and intimidation and * * * control” but that it was “not a case of physical violence or threats of physical violence.” It was the magistrate’s view that, “in order to protect the plaintiff from the intimidation and the harassment,” the existing order for protection issued on August 10, 2012 should remain in effect as a civil order. In accordance with the magistrate’s decision, a civil restraining order against defendant was entered on November 9, 2012. The defendant filed a timely appeal to the Chief Judge of the Family Court, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 8-10-3.1(d).', '-4-', 'C', 'The Defendant’s Appeal to the Chief Judge', 'On April 18, 2013, a hearing was held before the Chief Judge on defendant’s appeal. The defendant contended that, because the magistrate found that the present case sounded in “harassment and intimidation and * * * control” but was not “a case of physical violence or threats of physical violence,” she exceeded her statutory authority under chapter 15 of title 15 when she issued the civil restraining order.', 'The Chief Judge determined that, based on her review of the testimony of both plaintiff and defendant at the hearing before the magistrate, “there [was] no question that [defendant had] intimidated and [had] bull[ied]” plaintiff and that the magistrate, by issuing a civil restraining order, “did what she was supposed to do.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews questions of statutory construction and interpretation in a de novo manner. State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014); see also McCulloch v. McCulloch, 69 A.3d 810, 819 (R.I. 2013); Downey v.

It is a well-settled principle that, “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Diamante, 83 A.3d at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 616 (R.I. 2011); Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996).

Chariho Regional School Distict, 21 A.3d 264, 271 (R.I. 2011); Downey, 996 A.2d at 1150.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the magistrate committed an error when she issued a civil restraining order pursuant to § 15-15-3(a) because any remedy afforded to a plaintiff under chapter 15 of title 15 must be predicated upon a finding of “[d]omestic abuse” as set forth in § 15-15-1(2); defendant represents that the magistrate made “an explicit finding on the record that the case did not involve domestic abuse.” The defendant further contends that, if this Court determines that the magistrate made “a positive finding of domestic abuse, such a finding is unfounded and unsupported” by plaintiff’s complaint and the affidavit in support of same, as well as the testimony presented at the hearing before the magistrate. The defendant attempts to frame his argument as an appeal of the magistrate’s order; however, what is properly before this Court is the affirmance by the Chief Judge of the Family Court of the magistrate’s order issuing a civil restraining order.', 'In our judgment, defendant’s conduct was clearly the type of conduct that the General Assembly has mandated can be the predicate for the issuance of a protective order. Section 15- 15-3(a) expressly authorizes issuance of a protective order on behalf of a “person suffering from domestic abuse.” The term “[d]omestic abuse” is defined, with a laudable degree of specificity, in § 15-15-1(2). Among the acts specified in a later subsection of the statute as constituting “domestic abuse” is “[s]talking.” That subsection (viz., § 15-15-1(6)) reads in its entirety as follows:', '-6-', '“‘Stalking’ means harassing another person or willfully,', 'maliciously and repeatedly following another person with the', 'intent to place that person in reasonable fear of bodily injury[.]” It is significant that the just-quoted statutory definition is worded in the disjunctive. Accordingly, for present purposes, it suffices to focus on the first five words of that definition: “‘Stalking’ means harassing another person.”', 'In turn, the term “harassing” is statutorily defined as follows:', '“‘Harassing’ means following a knowing and willful course', 'of conduct directed at a specific person with the intent to seriously', 'alarm, annoy, or bother the person, and which serves no legitimate', 'purpose. The course of conduct must be such as would cause a', 'reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, or be in', 'fear of bodily injury[.]” Section 15-15-1(8). In the present action, defendant’s conduct fell within the purview of “domestic abuse” because he was “harassing” (and thus “stalking”) plaintiff within the meaning of the statute. The plaintiff testified with respect to defendant’s repeated use of vulgar language towards her and his threatening demeanor and tone; and she stated in both her complaint and at the hearing before the magistrate that defendant had placed her “in fear of physical harm.” The defendant admitted to such conduct, and it is worth noting that he also acknowledged that his swearing at plaintiff in the midst of a phone call constituted “harassment.” It is clear to us (1) that defendant was engaging in “a knowing and willful course of conduct” directed at plaintiff, with the intent to “seriously alarm, annoy, or bother” her and (2) that such conduct would cause a reasonable person to “be in fear of bodily injury.” Section 15-15-1(8).', 'After a careful review of the record, we are unable to find where, as defendant contends, the magistrate made “an explicit finding on the record that the case did not involve domestic abuse;” the finding by the magistrate to which defendant appears to be referring to is her finding that the instant case was “not a case of physical violence or threats of physical violence.” It is', '-7- apparent, however, from the clear and unambiguous language of the statute that actual physical harm or threats thereof are not required for a finding that, in a given case, “domestic abuse,” as defined by § 15-15-1(2), is present. See National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Capital Properties, Inc., 88 A.3d 1150, 1156 (R.I. 2014). As previously indicated, in our view, the above-referenced testimony established that defendant had been “harassing” plaintiff within the plain meaning of the statute. See D’Ambra v. North Providence School Committee, 601 A.2d 1370, 1375 (R.I. 1992).', 'In his written submission to this Court, the defendant concedes that, if there is a finding of “domestic abuse” as defined by § 15-15-1(2), then § 15-15-3(a) expressly provides the hearing justice with the discretion to choose an appropriate remedy based on the facts or circumstances of a particular case in order to protect a claimant from that domestic abuse. Section 15-15-3(a) clearly and unambiguously provides for relief from abuse in a variety of forms, “including, but not limited to,” five specified remedies—one of which is a protective order. See Diamante, 83 A.3d at 550. Furthermore, § 15-15-3(h)(2) clearly states that any proceedings under this chapter “shall not preclude any other available civil or criminal remedies.” We read this language in conjunction with § 8-10-38, which confers on the Family Court the same power which is conferred on the Superior Court by the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 8-6-1. Section 8-6-1 provides that the Supreme and Superior Courts may “enter such judgments, decrees, and orders * * * as may be necessary or proper to carry into full effect all the powers and jurisdiction * * * conferred upon them * * * .” Accordingly, the Chief Judge properly affirmed the magistrate’s order because it was within the magistrate’s authority to issue a civil restraining order in this case after determining that, based on the evidence before her, the civil restraining order was necessary to protect the plaintiff from the defendant’s harassment.', '-8-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.

On land owned by the plaintiff, Rose Nulman Park Foundation (Foundation) and described as “a diamond on the necklace that is Rhode Island’s beautiful coastline,” 1 the defendants, Robert C.

That parcel was subdivided into two lots, one of which was designated as 1444 Ocean Road 3 (the Four Twenty property) and abuts the Nulman property. The defendants, who are developers of real estate, hired Carrigan Engineering to assist them with the process of obtaining all the necessary permits to construct a single-family residence on the Four Twenty property. Carrigan Engineering, accordingly, produced a site development plan showing the location of the proposed structure in relation to what was believed to be the boundary line between the Four Twenty property and the Nulman property. The site development plan was stamped by Craig 2', 'This property is designated as Assessor’s Map M, Lot No. 162 in the Land Evidence Records of the town of Narragansett, and has been owned by the Nulman family since sometime in the early 1990s. 3', 'This lot is designated as Assessor’s Map M, Lot No. 161 in the Land Evidence Records of the town of Narragansett.', '-2- Richard Carrigan as a registered professional engineer and noted that the “[d]epicted boundary survey conforms with a Class III standard as adopted by the Rhode Island Registration of Professional Land Surveyors.” 4 In November 2009, after defendants obtained a building permit approving the construction of the structure on the Four Twenty Property, construction began and was substantially completed by January 2011.', 'At that time, Four Twenty entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Four Twenty property to a prospective buyer for a price of approximately $1.9 million. In conjunction with the proposed purchase and sale, the prospective buyer had a survey conducted which revealed that the structure was, in fact, entirely located on the Nulman property. Consequently, the buyer terminated the agreement to purchase the structure.', 'Lamoureux immediately contacted Ms. Nulman to inform her of the problem and attempted to determine whether an accommodation or agreement could be reached. Ms. Nulman informed him that the land was not for sale and that the structure would have to be taken down or moved.', 'The Foundation instituted the instant action in the Washington County Superior Court on March 11, 2011, asserting that the structure constituted a continuing trespass on its property and requesting a mandatory injunction ordering defendants to remove it and otherwise return the Nulman property to its original condition. A bench trial was conducted before a Superior Court justice on June 21, 2012. Carol Nulman testified at trial that the $1.5 million penalty provision 4', 'According to the Rhode Island Society of Professional Land Surveyors, a Class III survey is defined as a “data accumulation survey,” which “measure[s] and show[s] the relative positions or locations of physical features to a stated graphical scale * * *.” This definition includes the caveat that “[t]o the extent that property lines are reflected on such plans, they are to be regarded as pictorial only, unless such boundaries are also certified to a Class I, Class II, or Class V standard.” We thank the amicus for this helpful information. At trial, Lamoureux testified that he was unfamiliar with what a Class III survey was.', '-3- in the settlement agreement was intended to make clear that the Nulman property was never to be sold or built on. She further testified that the Nulmans pay costs associated with the ownership and maintenance of the Park, including liability insurance, lawn care maintenance, and property taxes. She stated that the only structure on the property is a gazebo which serves as a memorial to Rose Nulman and a friend of the Nulman family and is used for various functions that take place at the Park. Lamoureux testified that the total cost for the construction and maintenance of the structure, including a construction loan that he had obtained, amounted to approximately $619,000.', 'Lamoureux stated that the house encroached upon the Nulman property by approximately 13,000 square feet, which is 6.6 percent of the four and one-half acres that make up the entire Nulman property. 5 He further testified that the house could not, at that time, be moved onto another lot because he would first need to obtain the necessary building permits in order to do so and that, assuming he obtained the requisite permits, the cost of moving the house would be between $300,000 and $400,000. 6', 'The trial justice issued a written decision on September 11, 2012. After acknowledging that it was an “unfortunate situation” and noting that defendants had understandably relied on the plan they had commissioned from Carrigan Engineering, he found that this reliance did not shift responsibility for the trespass from defendants. He went on to conclude that a 13,000 square foot intrusion, amounting to approximately 6 percent of the Nulman property, could not be classified as a de minimis encroachment. He noted that a balancing of the equities was not required in considering injunctive relief in this situation, but nonetheless considered defendants’ argument 5', 'Ms. Nulman explained that the portion of the land which was encroached upon by the house was overgrown with shrubs and had not, therefore, been generally used by the public for recreational purposes. 6', 'At oral argument, defendants stated that they have begun the process of obtaining the necessary permits but that the process has been stalled, due to an appeal, that is currently pending in Superior Court.', '-4- that the cost of the removal would be greatly disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the plaintiff from the removal. He cited this Court’s opinion in Santilli v. Morelli, 102 R.I. 333, 338, 230 A.2d 860, 863 (1967), for the proposition that the disproportionality of the cost of removal to the benefit to the plaintiff is not a bar to the granting of injunctive relief. The trial justice concluded that forcing a sale of even a part of the Nulman property would be inconsistent with the fundamental right of property ownership. Accordingly, the trial justice granted plaintiff’s request for a mandatory injunction and ordered defendants to remove the structure and other improvements from the land belonging to the Foundation. Final judgment for plaintiff entered on October 23, 2012, mandating that defendants remove the encroachments from the Nulman property within 180 days.', 'The defendants filed a notice of appeal to this Court on November 2, 2012. By a consent order entered on December 4, 2012, the enforcement of the judgment of the Superior Court was stayed pending this appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A judgment in a nonjury case will be reversed on appeal when it can be shown that the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence[,] or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.” Lamarque v.

The defendants further contend that the trial justice abused his discretion in granting the mandatory injunction because he failed to properly balance the equities.', 'It is a bedrock principle of our property jurisprudence that land is not fungible; and, accordingly, equitable remedies are normally used when it comes to injuries and intrusions to it. See, e.g., Griffin v. Zapata, 570 A.2d 659, 661-62 (R.I. 1990) (stating that the equitable remedy of specific performance is appropriate where adequate compensation cannot be achieved through money damages, as for example, where land is involved); Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863 (noting that it is only in “exceptional cases where the substantial rights of the landowner may be properly safeguarded without recourse to an injunction”).', 'Likewise, we have generally held that the appropriate remedy for a continuing trespass is injunctive relief.', 'See Raposa v. Guay, 84 R.I. 436, 444, 125 A.2d 113, 117 (1956) (acknowledging the general rule that an owner of land is entitled to demand the removal of an encroaching building); Bentley v.

In Santilli, this Court explicitly adopted the general rule that “[a] continuing trespass wrongfully interferes with the legal rights of the owner, and in the usual', '-6- case those rights cannot be adequately protected except by an injunction which will eliminate the trespass.” Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863 (quoting Ferrone v. Rossi, 42 N.E.2d 564, 566 (Mass. 1942)). Since then, this Court has adhered to that principle. See Renaissance Development Corp. v. Universal Properties Group, Inc., 821 A.2d 233, 238 (R.I. 2003) (citing Santilli for “the general rule that when there is a continuing trespass on an owner’s land, he or she is entitled to a mandatory injunction”).', 'We have also acknowledged, however, that this general rule is not absolute and that, accordingly, in exceptional cases, a court may, in its discretion, decline to follow it where the injunctive relief would operate oppressively and inequitably. See Adams v. Toro, 508 A.2d 399, 401 n.1 (R.I. 1986) (“The [general] rule will not apply in those exceptional cases where the rights of the landowner can be adequately protected without resort to injunctive relief that would operate oppressively and inequitably against the encroaching party.”); Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863 (“[T]he existence of such circumstances may in exceptional cases move the court to withhold the coercive relief contemplated by the general rule.”). We have held that these exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, acquiescence, laches, or a de minimis trespass. See Bochterle v. Saunders, 36 R.I. 39, 45-46, 88 A. 803, 806 (1913) (stating that a finding of laches would operate to bar the plaintiff from the requested relief and also noting that the encroachment of only eighteen inches was “slight” and would not “impede or embarrass the complainant in its use and enjoyment”); Bentley, 19 R.I. at 208, 32 A. at 919 (noting that a party would not be entitled to injunctive relief to remove an obstruction of an easement if a finding of acquiescence was made and where the encroachment “existed for more than twenty years without objection”).', '-7-', 'In addition to these discrete situations, we have also held that courts may withhold injunctive relief after balancing the equities or, put another way, considering the relative hardships to the parties. See, e.g., Bentley, 19 R.I. at 208, 32 A. at 919 (“[Where] the obstruction * * * does not interfere with his use of the way, and relief in equity would be of no real benefit to him, but a cause of great trouble to the respondents, * * * we may properly leave him to his remedy at law.”). More recently, in a case dealing with injunctive relief to enforce restrictive covenants, this Court clarified that a trial court is not required to balance the equities before granting injunctive relief, noting that “[t]he doctrine of balancing the equities is applied in cases when the enforcement of a restriction will disproportionately harm the defendant with little benefit to the plaintiff.” Cullen, 15 A.3d at 982. However, this Court has never stated—nor do we now hold—that a trial court is required to balance the equities before granting injunctive relief in a continuing trespass case. See, e.g., Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863 (stating that, in exceptional cases, a court may deny injunctive relief). Moreover, as this Court has emphasized, “[t]he issuance and measure of injunctive relief rest in the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Cullen, 15 A.3d at 981.', 'Our review of the record and the trial justice’s decision compels us to conclude that the trial justice thoroughly and appropriately contended with the facts of the case and all the arguments presented by the parties. We discern no error in the trial justice’s statement of the applicable law.', 'We note that defendants mischaracterize the trial justice’s decision in stating that he erroneously concluded that the only exceptions to the general rule are acquiescence, laches, or when the trespass is de minimis. While he explicitly discussed those three exceptions and found they did not exist, he correctly acknowledged that there may be other exceptional circumstances', '-8- that would justify a departure from the general rule. Further, the trial justice went beyond the three listed exceptions to address defendants’ balancing arguments, although he noted that he “was not obligated to balance the equities when considering injunctive relief.” We are of the opinion that the trial justice correctly stated and applied our precedents in his decision.', 'The defendants take issue with the trial justice’s balancing of the equities, specifically with his finding that requiring plaintiff to give up 6 percent of the total Nulman property was “six percent more than what a landowner in fee simple should be forced to transfer.” They contend that, in so doing, he signaled a categorical refusal to actually balance the equities. We disagree with defendants’ argument. Not only did the trial justice acknowledge the great value placed on property rights, but he also meaningfully grappled with the relative hardships to the parties. He considered the “substantial financial burden” which an injunction would place on defendants, but concluded that the harm to the Nulmans that would result from a deliberate thwarting of their express intent in creating the Foundation outweighed the burden to defendants.', 'This Court has repeatedly made clear that a departure from the general rule that a continuing trespass should be remedied by injunctive relief is justified only in exceptional circumstances. See Cullen, 15 A.3d at 982 (emphasizing that balancing of the equities is appropriate only “in extraordinary cases”); Adams, 508 A.2d at 401 (holding that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny mandatory injunction to remove encroachment from the plaintiff’s property where there was nothing in the record to indicate that any circumstances would make injunctive relief inequitable). We are satisfied that the case at bar does not involve such exceptional circumstances “which would render such coercive relief inequitable or oppressive.” Adams, 508 A.2d at 401. Indeed, we are of the opinion that a fair balancing of the equities supports the trial justice’s decision to grant injunctive relief.', '-9-', 'The defendants emphasize that this case does not involve knowing or deliberate conduct, that this Court has concluded justifies the imposition of injunctive relief without balancing the equities. See Cullen, 15 A.3d at 983 (concluding that a balancing of the equities was not appropriate where “the defendants knowingly and admittedly violated the valid restrictive covenants that applied to their property”); Renaissance Development Corp., 821 A.2d at 239 (“Considering that [the] defendants knowingly and deliberately encroached on Renaissance’s property, * * * a balancing of the equities was not appropriate because the hardship to [the] defendants was self-inflicted.”). They further insist that Lamoureux’s reliance on hired experts was “utterly reasonable,” and that, accordingly, he had the “clean hands” which would make balancing appropriate. The trial justice, in fact, agreed that Lamoureux’s reliance on Carrigan’s site development plan was justified, but stated that it did not suffice to exempt defendants from liability. We agree with the trial justice’s conclusion. 7', 'The defendants urge us to follow the example of courts in other jurisdictions, which have relied on the balancing of the equities or the relative hardships to the parties, in denying injunctive relief in cases where the encroachment was innocently done and the hardship to the defendants would greatly outweigh any harm to the plaintiffs. See, e.g., Proctor v. Huntington, 238 P.3d 1117, 1121, 1123 (Wash. 2010) (denying injunctive relief in a case where the encroachment by the defendants of their house, garage, and well onto the plaintiff’s land was the result of a “good-faith surveying mistake,” and where any benefit to the plaintiff from the removal would be minimal); Szymczak v. LaFerrara, 655 A.2d 76, 79-80 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. 7', 'We do, however, find it curious that Lamoureux, as someone who, according to his own testimony, has been developing real estate for approximately forty years, was entirely unaware of the different classes of surveys and, moreover, in spite of the money he planned to expend based on Carrigan’s plan, failed to make any inquiry as to the significance of the caveat on Carrigan’s site development plan that it was a Class III survey.', '- 10 - Div. 1995) (stating that an injunction was not warranted when the injunction required the destruction of the defendant’s home where the encroachment was due to an innocent mistake and where the encroachment was on an undeveloped lot belonging to the plaintiff). We find these cases to be inapposite to the case at bar. The defendants averred at oral argument that the encroachment here has not caused plaintiff any substantial injury because the portion of the Nulman property on which the house was built was overgrown with brush.', 'Moreover, defendants place great weight on the various hardships that moving the house to the actual lot owned by them would cause—from the time and money defendants would need to expend to obtain the necessary permits to build on their lot, as well as the expense of actually moving the house.', 'We deem defendants’ arguments to be without merit and conclude that the harm to plaintiff more than outweighs the hardships to defendants in having to remove the house. We begin by emphasizing, as did the trial justice, that an encroachment of some 13,000 square feet is not a minimal one. The encroachment here is not small enough that a balancing of the equities makes the hardship to defendants outweigh the harm to plaintiff. Compare Bentley, 19 R.I. at 207-08, 32 A. at 919 (holding that where a building encroached onto a gangway by three feet eight inches but did not otherwise interfere with the plaintiff’s use of the gangway in any way, an injunction was not warranted), with Renaissance Development Corp., 821 A.2d at 239 (approving a permanent injunction where the encroachment was approximately 250 square feet). Moreover, we note that Carol and Joel Nulman, as the Trustees of the Foundation, would potentially be personally liable for paying the $1.5 million penalty in the event that the house is permitted to remain on the Nulman property. While the defendants insist that the trial justice erred in considering the potential hardship that would be inflicted on the individual trustees, as', '- 11 - non-parties to the suit, it is accepted that in balancing the equities, a court may consider the interests of third parties and of the public in general. See Restatement (Second) Torts § 942 (1979).', 'Finally, in addition to any injury suffered by plaintiff or by the Nulmans personally, we must consider the interests of the public. Ms. Nulman testified that the intent in starting the Foundation was to ensure that the land was never developed as “[i]t’s a historic spot surrounded by the ocean and * * * we should maintain this for the public use. * * * The sentimental value to the public is enormous * * *.” This clear commitment of the land’s use as community space satisfies us that any attempt to build on even a portion of the property would constitute an irreparable injury, not only to plaintiff but to the public. Cf. Foster Glocester Regional School Building Committee v. Sette, 996 A.2d 1120, 1124 (R.I. 2010) (stating that, in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a court should consider “the balance of the equities, including * * * the public interest”) (quoting Iggy’s Doughboys, Inc. v. Giroux, 729 A.2d 701, 705 (R.I. 1999)). See also EBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006) (“A plaintiff [seeking a permanent injunction] must demonstrate * * * that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”).', 'In conclusion, we are not unsympathetic to the defendants’ plight and agree that this is, as the trial justice acknowledged, an “unfortunate situation.” We are, however, convinced that it would be an unjust result to order the transfer of title to a portion of the Nulman property to the defendants or award only money damages. While the defendants may well have clean hands, the plaintiff is certainly an innocent party as well. Indeed, we note that the plaintiff has been put to the inconvenience of protecting its right to its property in court as a consequence of wanting to ensure that the public would always be able to enjoy the property in its natural state. It is said', '- 12 - that “no good deed goes unpunished.” Whatever the truth of the saying might be, this Court declines to punish the innocent plaintiff by forcing it to lose any portion of its property. To do so would be to effect a judicial taking of property for private benefit. “[T]he duty of the courts is to protect rights, and innocent complainants cannot be required to suffer the loss of their rights because of the expense to the wrongdoer.” Renaissance Development Corp., 821 A.2d at 238 (quoting Ariola v. Nigro, 156 N.E.2d 536, 540 (Ill. 1959)). As this Court made clear in Santilli, the fact that an encroaching building “was erected in good faith * * * is not a bar to the granting of coercive relief.” Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863. We find no error on the part of the trial court in issuing the mandatory injunction. Indeed, we conclude that injunctive relief is the appropriate remedy in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s granting of the plaintiff’s request for such relief.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

Santana-Sosa then defaulted on payments due under the note and mortgage, and MERS initiated foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold at a foreclosure sale on June 1, 2009. MERS was the high bidder at the sale with a bid of $36,000, and MERS then assigned its bid to Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche).

Checrallah, 60 A.3d 598, 601 (R.I. 2013)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Santana-Sosa’s main contention on appeal appears to be that the foreclosure was invalid and, therefore, BANA did not have a right to collect the insurance proceeds. Santana-Sosa contends that the hearing justice erred by determining that the propriety of the foreclosure was not an issue pertinent to this case. According to Santana-Sosa, the hearing justice overlooked multiple issues of material fact regarding the validity of the foreclosure: whether there was an agency relationship between or among MERS and Deutsche, “Countrywide,” or BANA; whether the note was properly endorsed; and whether BANA was the servicer for a party with an interest in the note and mortgage.', 'Santana-Sosa does not, however, attempt to explain how an invalid foreclosure would entitle her to receive the insurance proceeds at issue in this interpleader action. Instead, she merely appears to assert that BANA does not have a legitimate claim to the proceeds and that, therefore, she is entitled to the funds. We do not find this argument to be persuasive. Even if there had been a dispute between the various lenders and servicers as to who among them was', '-6- entitled to collect the proceeds, no conceivable resolution of this dispute would result in Santana- Sosa, the borrower, having a legitimate claim to the funds. 9', 'Additionally, Santana-Sosa argues that the mortgage was void pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-11-1 because it was allegedly missing a signature 10 and that, therefore, BANA is not entitled to collect the insurance proceeds. Page thirteen of the mortgage document, however, shows Santana-Sosa’s signature, as well as the signature of a notary public witness. Santana- Sosa does not dispute having signed the mortgage. All that appears to be missing is the signature of the notary on page fourteen of the mortgage, directly above where the notary’s name is printed. Even if the mortgage lacked proper notarization, however, this would not render it void. Section 34-11-1 provides in part:', '“Every conveyance of lands * * * by way of mortgage', '* * * shall be void unless made in writing duly signed,', 'acknowledged as hereinafter provided * * * ; provided, however,', 'that the conveyance, if delivered, as between the parties and their', 'heirs, and as against those taking by gift or devise, or those having', 'notice thereof, shall be valid and binding though not acknowledged', 'or recorded.” Furthermore, while § 34-11-1.1 specifies that “[t]he signatories and notaries public to all * * * mortgages * * * shall have their names typed or printed immediately beneath or adjacent to their signatures,” the section further provides that “[f]ailure to comply herewith shall not affect the 9', 'Counsel for Santana-Sosa asserted at oral argument that he had filed a cross-claim directly challenging the foreclosure. Counsel did file a cross-claim against MERS; this claim, however, was for declaratory relief, in which Santana-Sosa asserted that she was entitled to the insurance proceeds, that MERS was not a party to the insurance contract, that MERS had no beneficial interest in the insurance proceeds, and that MERS lacked standing to make a claim to the insurance proceeds. This cross-claim could not reasonably be construed as a direct challenge to the validity of the foreclosure. 10', 'It is unclear whose signature is allegedly missing. Santana-Sosa states that page fourteen of the mortgage “is notarized but never signed by the alleged Mortgagor.” Santana-Sosa, however, was the mortgagor, and her signature appears on the “borrower” line on page thirteen. Page fourteen of the mortgage contains only a space for the notary’s signature, which is left blank. The notary’s printed name appears below the signature line.', '-7- validity of any such instrument * * * .” Thus, even if the mortgage was not properly notarized, it would nevertheless constitute a valid agreement between Santana-Sosa and the lender. See Carrozza v. Carrozza, 944 A.2d 161, 165 (R.I. 2008).', 'Santana-Sosa further argues that the allegations contained in the Joseph Affidavit on behalf of BANA were inadmissible because there was no evidence that Joseph’s statements were based upon personal knowledge. In her affidavit, however, Joseph stated that she was an assistant vice president for BANA, that she reviewed the books and records of BANA relating to Santana-Sosa’s loan, and that her affidavit was based upon that review. In our opinion, this statement is sufficient to show that her affidavit was “made on personal knowledge” as required by Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 534 (R.I. 2013). 11', 'BANA, for its part, asserts that the mortgage and the hazard authorization are valid contracts, which required Santana-Sosa to maintain an insurance policy, with Impac and its successors and assigns named as the loss payee. Accordingly, BANA argues that it is entitled to the insurance proceeds as an agent for Deutsche. We agree.', 'The traditional rules of contract construction apply to the interpretation of a covenant contained in a mortgage. See Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1078, 1081 (R.I. 2013). The determination of whether a contract’s terms are ambiguous is a question of law, which we review de novo. Furtado v. Goncalves, 63 A.3d 533, 537 (R.I. 2013). This Court “has no need to construe contractual provisions unless those terms are ambiguous.” Miller, 80 A.3d at 49 (quoting DiPaola v. DiPaola, 16 A.3d 571, 576 (R.I. 2011)). When “determining ambiguity, 11', 'We do note that the Joseph affidavit does not clearly establish the chronological travel of the note as between Impac and Deutsche.

We do not perceive any ambiguity in these contracts; the clear result is that Santana-Sosa is not entitled to the insurance proceeds because she agreed to maintain fire 13', 'Santana-Sosa has not provided evidence that the amount due on the note and mortgage was less than the amount of the insurance proceeds. According to the Joseph affidavit submitted by BANA, the note and mortgage had an unpaid deficiency of $263,064.44 at the time of the foreclosure sale. RIJRA issued a check for the insurance proceeds in the amount of $245,188.28.

24,State : v. : Roger Watkins.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. We are confronted in this case with the tragic, yet all-too-common scenario in which an adult in a position of authority uses that authority to engage in an inappropriate and illicit sexual relationship. The defendant, Roger Watkins, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction, having been found guilty by a jury of six counts of first-degree sexual assault and four counts of second-degree sexual assault, for which he was sentenced to fifty years, with twenty-five years to serve and twenty-five years suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) admitting evidence concerning prior acts of misconduct committed by the defendant against the complainant; (2) allowing an examining physician to testify to statements made by the complainant during the course of her treatment; and (3) denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On November 23, 2010, a Providence County grand jury returned an eleven-count indictment charging defendant with seven counts of first-degree sexual assault and four counts of second-degree sexual assault on the complaining witness, Jessica. 1 In May 2012, a trial was held in Providence Superior Court, during which the state presented six witnesses: Rodrick Shepard, Jessica’s high school classmate and boyfriend; Patrolman Christopher Owens, a Providence Police officer and high school resource officer; Dr. Amy Goldberg, a pediatrician at Hasbro Children’s Hospital; Lisa, Jessica’s mother; Jessica; and Detective Christopher Rotella of the Providence Police Department. We summarize only the testimony pertinent to this appeal.', 'Patrolman Christopher Owens', 'Patrolman Christopher Owens of the Providence Police Department testified that in February 2010, he was the school resource officer at Hope High School. He testified that he maintained an office at the school and acted “as a resource to students.” Due to the nature of his position, Ptlm. Owens had regular contact with the students at the school and, as a result, he became familiar with both Rodrick Shepard and Jessica. Patrolman Owens testified to an incident that occurred on February 23, 2010. He testified that he was in a meeting in his office when “[a] couple of teachers’ aides came in and told [him] that there was a disturbance in the parking lot,” and he responded immediately.', 'When he arrived outside, he saw defendant yelling at Shepard and noticed that defendant “was pretty upset.” Patrolman Owens asked what was going on, to which defendant replied “that his daughter should have been home * * * she should not have been in school.” The defendant 1', 'In the interest of the minor victim’s privacy, we will refer to both her and her mother by the use of fictitious names.', '-2- further explained to Ptlm. Owens that “he was in the shower at home and when he got out he noticed that she was gone” and, when he saw Jessica and Shepard in the parking lot “he thought that she may be bunking school.”', 'Having defused the situation between defendant and Shepard, Ptlm. Owens testified that he saw Jessica in the parking lot with two school administrators; she appeared to be upset, and he “could tell that she was crying.” While in the parking lot, Jessica told Ptlm. Owens that “if I go back home with [defendant] he’s going to beat the hell out of me.” Thereafter, Ptlm. Owens testified that he wanted to speak with all parties involved, so he had Shepard accompany the administrators while he spoke to Jessica and defendant alone in his office. Once back in his office, defendant refused to sit down, was yelling and using profanity, and was still visibly upset. Patrolman Owens testified that Jessica refused to look at defendant or answer any questions while he was in the room.', 'Shortly thereafter, Ptlm. Owens summoned the school psychologist, Mrs. Clarke, to speak with Jessica. Patrolman Owens testified that Mrs. Clarke is “a confidante to the kids in the school,” and “sits in with just about every case * * * where they have female students.” After Mrs. Clarke arrived, Ptlm. Owens had defendant transported to the administrator’s office. With defendant out of the room, Jessica “broke down * * * hid her face in her hands and she started to cry uncontrollably.” The defendant was arrested shortly thereafter, and Jessica was brought to the Providence police station to give a written statement.', '-3-', 'Doctor Amy Goldberg', 'The state next called Dr. Amy Goldberg, a pediatrician at Hasbro Children’s Hospital and the supervisor of the Child Protection Program, a program that evaluates children who are potential victims of maltreatment.', 'She testified regarding the results of a March 3, 2010 examination that she performed on Jessica. Much of Dr. Goldberg’s substantive testimony involved her examination of Jessica, during which Jessica recounted a lengthy history of sexual abuse at the hands of defendant. Doctor Goldberg testified that Jessica reported that the sexual abuse started around the time she was fourteen-years-old, when defendant would touch her over her clothes.', 'Eventually, this touching progressed to touching underneath the clothes and digital/vaginal penetration.', 'When Jessica was approximately sixteen-years-old, the abuse progressed to penile/vaginal and oral/vaginal penetration.', 'Doctor Goldberg testified, over defense counsel’s objection, that Jessica said that she became “increasingly more afraid” during this period when the sexual assaults were taking place. In addition to Jessica’s increasing fear, Dr. Goldberg testified that “there [were] other forms of * * * more subtle fear and feelings of fear * * * in regards of not being able to * * * go to school.”', 'Doctor Goldberg testified that Jessica told her that, when the digital penetration began, it was in the context of Jessica pretending to be asleep and being too afraid to tell defendant to stop. Jessica told Dr. Goldberg that the sexual encounters progressed and that defendant would tell her that she could not go to school unless she would perform sexual acts. Doctor Goldberg testified that at the time of the examination, Jessica was less than three weeks removed from the most recent sexual encounter with defendant.', 'During that most recent encounter—vaginal intercourse—Jessica said that she had complained of pain and asked defendant to stop, but he refused. Doctor Goldberg further testified that, based upon her evaluation, she had concluded to', '-4- a reasonable degree of medical certainty that there had been vaginal penetration. She then testified that she recommended Jessica for follow-up treatment, although she did not specify the nature of the treatment.', 'Jessica’s Mother', 'Jessica’s mother, Lisa, testified that she met defendant in 1983 and the two began dating shortly thereafter. By 2006, she and defendant were living in an apartment in Providence with their three children, as well as Lisa’s daughter, Jessica. She testified that by this time she and defendant were no longer dating; however, they continued to live together because “[h]e was there to help take care of the kids.” Lisa testified that defendant came into Jessica’s life when she was a baby. As part of taking care of the children, defendant would “take them out to places[,] * * * buy their clothes, feed them,” as well as stay involved in their sports and activities.', 'Lisa also testified at length about defendant’s role as the household disciplinarian. Lisa herself was not involved in the disciplining of her children because she “was easy on the kids so [defendant] didn’t like the way I disciplined [Jessica] so he took over.” This discipline, which was referred to in the household as being “on punishment,” involved “whip[ping] the behind,” keeping Jessica in her room without access to the phone, computer, or television, and not allowing her to date or see her friends. Lisa testified that, while Jessica was “on punishment,” defendant treated her differently from the way he treated the other children; for instance, he required her to do the other children’s chores around the home. The defendant would also keep Jessica home from school while she was “on punishment,” sometimes for days on end, and would force her to watch two to three hours of television with him at night. Lisa testified to a specific instance in which Jessica attended a baby shower with her boyfriend, Shepard; defendant', '-5- did not approve of Jessica and Shepard’s relationship, so he “kept her out of school for like a week.”', 'Lisa testified to seeing defendant wrestling with the children from time to time; she added that, after one particular wrestling match, Jessica complained to her that defendant had grabbed her breasts. She testified that she did not think much of her daughter’s complaint, and that, apart from the wrestling incident, she was unaware of any of the allegations by her daughter against defendant until after his arrest in February 2010.', 'Jessica', 'The complainant, Jessica, testified at length about her relationship with defendant. She testified that she remembered defendant moving in with her family when she was approximately eleven-years-old, and that he lived with them virtually the entire time up until his arrest in February 2010. Jessica testified that defendant was involved in her “whole life, like everything that [she] did,” including her schooling. Jessica testified that, when she started at Hope High School in 2006, defendant would frequently check on her attendance, often dropping by the high school at random to see that she was attending class and to talk to her teachers to make sure she was completing her work. In addition to monitoring how Jessica went about her schooling, defendant also took control over where and when she went to school. Jessica testified that, although she started at Hope High School, she “was getting in so much trouble” that defendant removed her to Adelaide High School midway through her sophomore year. While at Adelaide, Jessica began dating a boy, Kelvin. However, defendant did not approve of her dating, so he ordered her not to contact Kelvin, kept her out of school, and ultimately transferred her back to Hope High School.', '-6-', 'Although she testified about defendant’s role in her school life, the bulk of Jessica’s testimony revolved around defendant’s role as the household disciplinarian, which started “as far back as [she could] remember.”', 'This involved defendant doling out punishment, such as confining Jessica to the house, taking things from her, and forbidding her to be in contact with her friends. Further, as part of her punishment, Jessica was required to watch twenty hours of television with defendant each week; defendant would write down and keep track of the number of hours. Jessica testified that, with the exception of a brief period around Halloween when she was in the tenth grade, she was “on punishment” for “three years straight,” all through the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades. Jessica also testified to alleged acts of corporal punishment and sexual conduct that took place at the hands of defendant during this time period—the testimony about which partially forms the basis of the instant appeal. 2', 'With respect to the corporal punishment, Jessica testified to an incident in which she was using defendant’s daughter’s phone to talk with Kelvin—which defendant had prohibited her from doing. She testified that when defendant found out she had used the phone, “he came in the room and then he slapped me * * * kept telling me shut up,” and “[p]ut his hands around my neck and put me up against the wall.” 3 2', 'Prior to trial, defense counsel argued in limine to exclude the incidents of corporal punishment and uncharged sexual contact. The trial justice withheld ruling on the corporal punishment until trial and allowed the admission of the uncharged sexual contact under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. During trial, the trial justice addressed the uncharged conduct once again, stating that he weighed the proffered testimony under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and Rule 404(b) and would permit the witness to testify to the corporal punishment and would issue a limiting instruction to the jury. 3', 'It bears mentioning that at no time during this testimony did defense counsel object to the state’s questioning or the witness’s answers. At the hearing on the motions in limine, however, defense counsel objected to the admission of the testimony as “not reasonably necessary for the [s]tate to get into that area,” and “unduly prejudicial to [defendant].” At trial, the trial justice revisited his ruling from the motion in limine, and, pursuant to defense counsel’s previous objection, offered to give a limiting instruction after the elicitation of the testimony; the trial', '-7-', 'Jessica also testified to uncharged sexual conduct; specifically, instances of “play fighting” that took place between her and defendant in which he would “[g]rab [her] in [her] vagina or chest.” She testified that “[f]or as long as [she could] remember” she and her little sister would “play fight” with defendant two or three times a week, which would consist of them “attack[ing] him * * * trying to restrain each other and trying to hold him down.” However, Jessica also testified that, when they would “play fight,” defendant would grab and hold her vagina and breasts over her clothing. Although defendant would do this to Jessica “most of the time” when they would “play fight,” she testified that she never saw defendant grab her sister in the same way.', 'Jessica’s testimony portrayed a course of progressively escalating sexual misconduct perpetrated by defendant. It began when Jessica was in tenth grade when the two would watch television on the couch, and she would eventually fall asleep. She testified that the first time it happened, she woke up to find defendant next to her on the couch, touching her vagina in a massaging motion over her clothing. Jessica pretended to be asleep because she “was afraid of his reaction if [she] would have woke[n] up and seen him doing that or what he would say.” She testified that this happened about twice a week. She testified that she did not tell anyone about defendant’s behavior because she “didn’t think anyone would believe [her].” Although the pattern stayed the same during the first half of Jessica’s tenth-grade year—falling asleep on the couch and awakening to defendant touching her privates—defendant soon progressed to touching her breasts and vagina beneath her clothes. Shortly thereafter, during the spring of her tenth-grade year, defendant began penetrating her vagina with his finger. justice understood the grounds for defense counsel’s objection and ruled accordingly, sufficiently preserving the issue for our review. See State v. Baptista, 894 A.2d 911, 914 n.2 (R.I. 2006).', '-8-', 'By the time Jessica was a junior in high school, the sexual encounters were no longer just taking place while she pretended to be asleep. Jessica testified that, when she would get in trouble in school, defendant would keep her out of school unless she would perform sexual acts with him. Jessica testified that it began with defendant performing oral sex on her in the basement laundry room of their home. When asked how many times this happened to her, she stated: “I can’t count. I can’t give you an exact number of how many times it happened.” She testified that these encounters continued through her junior year of high school and into her senior year, but that she never told him to stop because she was afraid. She further testified that, when she was “on punishment” towards the end of her junior year, defendant told her that she would not be able to go back to school and that he would homeschool her unless she gave him oral sex. She then elaborated on the numerous occasions in which defendant would set a stopwatch and force her to perform oral sex on him until the allotted time ran out. This arrangement—defendant threatening to take Jessica out of school unless she performed sex acts on him, and her complying—continued well into her senior year of high school.', 'Jessica testified that, shortly before defendant’s arrest in February 2010, defendant found out that she had been talking on the phone with her boyfriend, Shepard. As punishment, defendant once again threatened to keep her out of school, although this time, in order to return to school, she had to have sexual intercourse with him. The defendant, as he often did, wrote his demand down on a piece of paper and gave it to Jessica. The two then waited for Lisa and the other children to leave the house and they went into the bedroom where defendant had Jessica remove her clothes and lie on the bed. The defendant then attempted to insert his penis into her vagina; however he stopped when Jessica started to cry and told him that it hurt.', '-9-', 'Jessica then testified to the confrontation that occurred between defendant and Shepard, which led to the meeting at school and, ultimately, defendant’s arrest. On that day, February 23, 2010, defendant was once again attempting to keep Jessica out of school; however, when he got in the shower, Jessica boarded a bus bound for her high school. When asked at trial why she left her house that day, she stated: “Because I knew what was going to happen. * * * He was going to tell me to do something with him sexually.”', 'Detective Christopher Rotella', 'The state’s final witness, Det. Christopher Rotella of the Providence Police Department, testified to taking Jessica’s and defendant’s respective statements on February 23, 2010. Detective Rotella testified that, after being advised of his Miranda 4 rights, defendant gave a verbal statement that was audio recorded. The recording was entered as a full exhibit at trial and was played in its entirety while members of the jury read along with a transcribed copy. 5', 'The recording, which ran for approximately forty-three minutes, consisted essentially of defendant narrating in explicit detail his relationship with Jessica.', 'The details given by defendant largely mirrored those testified to at trial by both Dr. Goldberg and Jessica. For instance, defendant talked about “play fighting” with Jessica, during which time he would grab her crotch in “kind of like a sexual nature,” yet, he claimed that “it was never anything more than that.” Later on in his statement, defendant described the transition from “play fighting” to sexually assaulting Jessica while she was asleep on the couch, stating: “We would sit on the couch and we’d watch TV. She would fall asleep. I would feel on her. I would finger her.” When asked specifically which parts, defendant replied, “her thighs, her legs, her chest. You know, all the essential parts and stuff like that.” He described how Jessica “acted like she was 4', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). 5', 'The transcribed copy was not entered as a full exhibit.', '- 10 - asleep,” but that he nevertheless “believe[d] it was consensual.” When asked whether Jessica gave him permission to perform these acts on her when she was asleep, defendant stated that “she didn’t give me permission, but * * * I know it was consensual,” because “she knew * * * and she didn’t mind.”', 'The defendant’s statement, much like the testimony of Dr. Goldberg and Jessica herself, described how the sexual encounters escalated over time. Although he could not pinpoint the exact number of times, defendant attested to numerous occurrences that took place in the basement laundry room, including his making oral/vaginal contact, as well as repeated contact with Jessica’s chest. He then described how he would only permit Jessica to return to school in exchange for sex acts, including sexual intercourse. Specifically, he stated that “when [he] was going to take [Jessica] out of school * * * [they] had sex so she could stay at Hope [High School].” He recalled how the arrangement came about; the two were sitting on the couch and he proposed to Jessica, “if you want to fool around, you can stay at Hope.” The defendant then recounted telling Jessica “that if she bumps any more classes or school that she has to have sex again * * * or just leave the school.” The defendant stated that, although he was the one who proposed the arrangements, it was Jessica who agreed to them. When asked whether he thought that it was wrong to forbid her to go to school unless she had sex with him, he admitted that it “was definitely wrong.” He stated that it was wrong to take advantage of her because of her age, because he is “an authority” and “control[s] what she can do and can’t do.”', 'In addition to narrating the sexual history, defendant’s statement also told of his role as the household disciplinarian. For instance, defendant described keeping Jessica “on punishment” for three years straight because, as he described, she was “better off.” The defendant also recounted the incident, testified to by Jessica, in which he punished her for using the phone', '- 11 - without permission: “I grabbed [her] by the neck; I pushed her up against the wall. I said, ‘Don’t you ever disrespect me like that again.’ * * * I probably grabbed her neck and held her for less than three or four seconds.” He admitted that Jessica was in fear, and that “[s]he knew that if she messed up that [he] could hurt her.”', 'At the conclusion of the trial, defendant was found guilty by a jury of all counts against him. 6', 'On July 18, 2012, the trial justice sentenced defendant to fifty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with twenty-five years to serve and twenty-five years suspended, with probation. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, defendant argues that: (1) the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing testimony regarding defendant’s acts of corporal punishment, as well as the uncharged incidents of sexual contact that occurred during the “play fighting”; (2) the trial justice erred in allowing Dr. Goldberg to testify to hearsay statements that improperly bolstered Jessica’s testimony; and (3) the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial because the interests of justice did not support the verdict.', 'We will address each of defendant’s contentions in turn, and supply additional facts as necessary to resolve the issues before this Court.', 'II', 'A', '“Play Fighting” and Corporal Punishment Testimony', 'Prior to trial, the state moved in limine to admit under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence the testimony regarding the “play fighting” that occurred, in which defendant would grab Jessica’s vagina over her clothing. The state argued that the evidence was probative of defendant’s larger plan of “grooming her for the sexual abuse that would come.” The trial 6', 'Count 10, charging defendant with first-degree sexual assault, was dismissed by the state pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure due to insufficient evidence at trial.', '- 12 - justice granted the motion, finding the evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) as probative of defendant’s “all-encompassing scheme or plan,” and “as showing some type of lewd disposition or intent on the part of the defendant towards this young woman.”', 'The state also moved in limine to admit the testimony regarding the incident in which defendant pushed Jessica up against a wall and grabbed her neck, arguing that that incident was probative of the coercion element of sexual assault—specifically, psychological coercion. The trial justice reserved judgment until trial and ultimately admitted the evidence. The trial justice issued limiting instructions to the jury regarding both the “play fighting” testimony and the testimony on corporal punishment.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in admitting the “play fighting” evidence because it was not essential to the state’s case and served no purpose “but to paint [defendant] as a depraved sexual predator.” Further, defendant argues that the admission of the evidence was unfairly prejudicial. With respect to the corporal punishment, defendant argues that the evidence did not pertain to the sexual assaults charged in the case and that the admission of such evidence was unfairly prejudicial and “bound to improperly infect a jury’s assessment of the evidence.”', '1. Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, it is well settled that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Baptista, 894 A.2d 911 (R.I. 2006), 7 in which this Court upheld the admission, pursuant to Rule 404(b), of 7', 'The facts in Baptista bear a striking similarity to the case at bar. In Baptista, much like the instant case, the defendant was convicted of multiple counts of first-degree sexual assault against his teenage stepdaughter. Baptista, 894 A.2d at 912. Prior to trial, the state argued that the uncharged acts were admissible to show force and coercion, as well as to demonstrate the defendant’s lewd disposition or intent towards the victim. Id. at 913. The trial justice allowed the testimony, which, while sparing the unsavory details, we note was considerably more graphic than the play fighting testimony in the instant case. Id. Thereafter, the trial justice issued a limiting instruction to the jury. Id.', '- 15 - testimony regarding uncharged sexual assaults perpetrated by the defendant against the complainant. In the case under review, the trial justice found that the testimony, “if * * * accepted by the jury, * * * would certainly fit in with the [s]tate’s theory of the case.” During the motions in limine, the trial justice agreed to issue an instruction to the jury at trial, limiting their consideration of the evidence. 8', 'The trial justice also articulated, albeit briefly, his rationale for allowing the testimony in the context of Rule 403, stating: “I have taken [Rule 403] into consideration in making a decision as to [the testimony] and I do believe it is probative evidence. I don’t feel that it is extremely prejudicial to the extent that it should be excluded from the jury’s consideration.”', 'Upon review, it is apparent to us that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion under Rule 404(b) and Rule 403 in admitting the “play fighting” testimony. After much consideration, the trial justice allowed the testimony. He then issued a proper and thorough instruction to the jury. We likewise agree with the trial justice’s assessment of the evidence under Rule 403; considering the wealth of other contemptible testimony regarding defendant’s illicit relationship 8', 'At trial, after Jessica testified to the “play fighting,” the trial justice issued the following instruction to the jury, to which defendant voiced no objection:', '“You just heard the description of this witness as what she', 'described as play fighting and alleged touching of her private areas', 'of her body. Again, this is one of those areas where you only', 'consider what is charged in this case. This defendant is not', 'charged with any offense related to that particular conduct that she', 'alleges occurred between her and this defendant. So I’m', 'instructing you at this time that in considering that testimony about', 'play fighting, again, it is for a limited purpose which you cannot', 'consider it for is to conclude that this defendant has some criminal', 'or bad character because of that incident that was just described or', 'put another way that he is a bad person and therefore he has the', 'tendency to commit the crimes that he is charged with in this case.', '“Your considering of that testimony, should you choose to', 'accept it, is offered for the limited purpose of proving the', 'defendant’s intent towards this defendant [sic] or to show some', 'common scheme or plan on his part with respect to conduct', 'directed towards this witness.”', '- 16 - with Jessica, we are hard-pressed to conclude that defendant was unfairly prejudiced by testimony concerning the inappropriate touching that occurred during their “play fighting.” Because we perceive no abuse of discretion, we have no cause to overturn the trial justice’s ruling.', 'b. Corporal Punishment', 'Similar to the “play fighting” testimony, the admission of evidence regarding defendant’s physical discipline of Jessica stands on substantially the same footing; the state moved in limine to admit testimony concerning defendant grabbing Jessica by the neck and pushing her up against a wall. However, unlike the “play fighting” testimony, the trial justice reserved until trial the decision on whether to admit the testimony on corporal punishment. The defendant argues that this “uncharged physical assault did not pertain to the sexual assaults charged in this case,” and, further, that “the altercation was an isolated incident, which could not * * * create an environment of implied physical threats.”', 'The defendant was charged with multiple counts of first-degree and second-degree sexual assault, each of which required the state to prove force or coercion beyond a reasonable doubt. See G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2(2); § 11-37-4(2). The state argued that the sexual assaults “occurred not through force, but through a level of psychological coercion based on * * * defendant’s position of authority and his level of dominance overall in the household.” This Court has held that psychological coercion is sufficient to prove the force or coercion element of sexual assault, even in the absence of physical force. See State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 735 (R.I. 1987) (“Sexual submission induced by fear is not the product of consent but of coercion. * * * A command on the part of one who possesses complete authority and overwhelming force to back', '- 17 - up that authority need not be accompanied by an explicit threat in order to be effectively coercive.”).', 'The testimony regarding the cell phone incident was not offered to show defendant’s propensity for violence; rather, it was submitted as an illustration of defendant’s role as the household disciplinarian, as well as the power and influence he wielded over Jessica. In a previous sexual assault case, we upheld the admission, under Rule 404(b), of testimony concerning a defendant stepfather’s role as disciplinarian as “probative of the degree of control, supervision, and discipline [the] defendant exercised over his stepdaughters.” State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1046 (R.I. 1994). Just as in the instant case, the state’s theory in Brigham “was that [the] defendant used his position as disciplinarian and head of the household to psychologically coerce [the victim] into the sexual acts.” Id. We held that the admission of such evidence was reasonably necessary to the state’s case and, coupled with an appropriate limiting instruction, was properly admitted under Rule 404(b). Brigham. 638 A.2d at 1046. In the case currently before us, it was necessary for the state to prove the element of force or coercion; therefore, admission of evidence in furtherance of that burden was permissible under Rule 404(b). See Martinez, 59 A.3d at 85.', 'Finally, we cannot agree with defendant’s contention that the admission of this testimony was unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.', 'As iterated supra, the testimony concerning the corporal punishment was probative of the state’s case and was weighed by the trial justice against the possibility of unfair prejudice to defendant. The evidence of corporal punishment was properly admitted pursuant to Rules 404(b) and 403; thus, we perceive no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice.', '- 18 -', 'B', 'Doctor Goldberg’s Testimony', 'The defendant’s next contention concerns the admission of lengthy portions of Dr. Goldberg’s testimony. Specifically, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in allowing Dr. Goldberg to testify to the issue of whether the sexual contact was the result of force or coercion, which was “the sole issue at trial.” This testimony, defendant contends, was inadmissible hearsay that did not fall under the exception for medical treatment or diagnosis and that “served only to improperly bolster the complainant’s credibility.” The defendant also claims error with respect to Dr. Goldberg testifying that she recommended Jessica for follow-up treatment, claiming that it “effectively rubber-stamped the complainant’s testimony by indirectly implying that the witness’s allegations were credible enough to merit professional treatment.”', '1. Standard of Review', '“[A] determination of whether an out-of-court statement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion.” State v.

Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 996 A.2d 684, 692 (R.I. 2010)). “Under this standard, a trial justice’s ruling will be upheld unless abuse of discretion that prejudices the complaining party is shown.” Id.

Discussion', '“Hearsay evidence is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at a trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1030 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Angell, 122 R.I. 160, 167, 405 A.2d 10, 14 (1979)); see Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. “As a rule, hearsay statements are excluded from the evidence introduced at trial because the usual safeguards of the oath, confrontation, and cross-examination, are not available.” Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1030. There are myriad exceptions to the rule, including Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which allows for the admission of “Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.” Rule 803(4) allows:', '“Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment', 'and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain,', 'or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or', 'external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis', 'or treatment, but not including statements made to a physician', 'consulted solely for the purposes of preparing for litigation or', 'obtaining testimony for trial.” Therefore, “[t]he test for determining admissibility ‘hinge[s] on whether what has been related by the patient will assist or is helpful in the diagnosis or treatment of [the patient’s] ailment.’” State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 151 (R.I. 2009) (quoting In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 456 (R.I. 2002)).', '“Statements that narrate details unconnected with either diagnosis or treatment, however, are inadmissible unless they fall under another hearsay exception.” Id.', 'In the instant case, Dr. Goldberg testified to numerous allegations made by Jessica during her March 3, 2010 evaluation. Over defense counsel’s objection, Dr. Goldberg testified that Jessica “told [her] how she had begun to feel over time that the abuse progressed”—specifically, that “[s]he was increasingly afraid and there was some, there w[ere] other forms of sort of more', '- 20 - subtle fear * * * .” She also testified that “[Jessica] would tell [her] that she would be told to do sexual acts in order to be able to go to school.” Defense counsel objected and asked for a curative instruction, arguing that it was “not a statement made for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment.” The state argued that, because the doctor testified that “part of her diagnosis and treatment is the patient’s psychological well-being” and that “this kind of psychological pressure or manipulation would be something that she factors in to her evaluation * * * .” The trial justice overruled the objection, finding that asking questions regarding the circumstances of the alleged acts is “part and parcel of what [the doctor] does” as a pediatrician specializing in child abuse. The issue before us, therefore, is whether Jessica’s statements to Dr. Goldberg were made for the purposes of treatment or diagnosis sufficient to allow admission pursuant to Rule 803(4).', 'As a specialist in child abuse pediatrics, Dr. Goldberg testified that her evaluations “pertain[] to a patient’s physical as well as mental health.” She further testified that part of her role is to make referrals for follow-up treatment to other, more specialized doctors, oftentimes psychologists or psychiatrists. The referrals, she testified, are tailored based on what she learned from the patient and may involve a psychological component depending on the nature of the sexual abuse. Her ultimate objective in terms of treating patients and referring them to other doctors is “[t]o mitigate the effects of sexual abuse,” which include depression and “different types of traumatic stress disorders.” Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice was correct in finding that “part and parcel” of what Dr. Goldberg does is ascertain the circumstances surrounding the sexual abuse.', 'In the context of Rule 803(4), we have consistently held that, “[w]hen statements about causation enter the realm of assigning fault, it is unlikely that the patient or the physician consider them related to diagnosis or treatment.” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 151; see State v. Pina, 455', '- 21 - A.2d 313, 315 (R.I. 1983). Nevertheless, a statement made to a treating physician is not per se inadmissible merely because it involves the patient’s emotional state; when an evaluation contains a psychological element as well as a physical one, those statements, much like the physical evaluation, may be pertinent to diagnosis and treatment. See Vallinoto v. DiSandro, 688 A.2d 830, 840-41 (R.I. 1997) (“[Patient] was being treated for psychological ailments, not physical ones, and the statements made by her to her social worker regarding her sexual activity with [the defendant] were directly relevant to the diagnosis of her mental state and the treatment that she was receiving * * * .”). We have also stated that, if the alleged perpetrator is a member of the victim’s household, his or her identity may be pertinent both to the formulation of an effective treatment plan and to ensuring that the child is safe and the treatment can be effectuated. Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1031. However, the simple fact that a statement could be helpful in diagnosis is not in itself sufficient for admission under Rule 803(4); there must be a proper foundation establishing that the challenged statements were in fact made for the purpose of treatment or diagnosis. Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1031.', 'Although Dr. Goldberg did testify that she evaluates patients “both from a medical standpoint as well as from an emotional or mental health standpoint,” she did not specifically testify that the statements Jessica made about her mounting fear of defendant or those regarding the exchange of sex for school attendance were made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. By Dr. Goldberg’s own admission, her evaluations are more centered on the physical trauma rather than the psychological, and her role “really is to evaluate children from a medical standpoint.”', 'Although Dr. Goldberg’s testimony regarding Jessica’s statements may have qualified as a statement for the purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis, there simply was insufficient foundation to establish that they were, in fact, made for that purpose. There was no', '- 22 - testimony about how Jessica’s statements were, or even could have been, used by Dr. Goldberg in making her treatment referral; her testimony that her role involves a psychological component, without more, is not enough to admit Jessica’s statements regarding her fear of defendant as a Rule 803(4) exception. See Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1031. Accordingly, because Dr. Goldberg’s testimony failed to adequately describe how Jessica’s statements factored into her treatment or diagnosis, the statements do not fall under Rule 803(4) and were admitted erroneously.', 'Although we find that there was not a proper foundation for the admission of Jessica’s hearsay statement concerning the possibility of psychological coercion as testified to by Dr. Goldberg, we are satisfied that such testimony is cumulative and harmless in light of the abundance of evidence properly admitted at trial. We have stated that “the admission of hearsay evidence is not prejudicial when the evidence is merely cumulative and when [the] defendant’s guilt is sufficiently established by proper evidence.” State v. Robinson, 989 A.2d 965, 979 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032). “[C]umulative evidence” is “that which tends ‘to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.’” Id. (quoting Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032).', 'The test to determine whether or not an item of evidence is cumulative “is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence to determine whether the admission of certain evidence was harmless in light of all the evidence admitted on that point.” Id. (quoting Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032). 9', 'Although Dr. Goldberg’s testimony was the first time the jury heard of Jessica’s fear of defendant and their sex-for-school quid pro quo, it certainly was not the last. Jessica testified to multiple instances in which defendant would not permit her to return to school unless she performed sexual acts with him. It is likewise apparent from the evidence that defendant, by 9', '“In order to meet the harmless-error test, there must be proof ‘beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.’” State v. Smith, 446 A.2d 1035, 1036 (R.I. 1982) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)).', '- 23 - virtue of his role as the household disciplinarian, had instilled such a sense of fear in Jessica that she felt as if she had no choice but to acquiesce to his sexual demands. In light of the fact that Dr. Goldberg’s testimony was corroborated by Jessica and, in part, by defendant himself, it is clear that her testimony was merely cumulative and that defendant was not unduly prejudiced by its erroneous admission. Therefore, we hold that the admission of the hearsay statements at issue does not warrant reversal by this Court.', 'We turn next to defendant’s contention that Dr. Goldberg’s testimony “indirectly impl[ied] that [Jessica’s] allegations were credible enough to merit professional treatment,” and thus constituted improper bolstering.', 'We have defined impermissible bolstering 10 as what “typically occurs when one witness offer[s] an opinion regarding the truthfulness or accuracy of another witness’[s] testimony.” Martin, 68 A.3d at 476 (quoting State v. Arroyo, 844 A.2d 163, 169 (R.I. 2004)). “However, it may also ‘occur even if the witness does not literally state an opinion concerning the credibility of another witness’s testimony,’ but rather, where ‘one witness’s testimony has the same substantive import as if it addressed another witness’s credibility, it is inadmissible.’” Id. (quoting Arroyo, 844 A.2d at 169). Here, Dr. Goldberg did not testify one way or the other concerning the veracity or credibility of Jessica’s statements; she merely testified to what she was told during the evaluation. We have held that a medical professional simply reiterating a patient’s statement without passing judgment on the accuracy or 10', 'Although at times this Court has used the terms “vouching” and “bolstering” interchangeably, the terms have separate, distinct meanings. See State v. Rushlow, 32 A.3d 892, 900 n.7 (R.I. 2011). By way of clarification, “[i]mpermissible bolstering typically occurs when one witness offers an opinion ‘concerning the truthfulness of the testimony of another witness * * * ,’” State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 470 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 479 (R.I. 1998)); whereas, “[v]ouching occurs when the government says or insinuates that it has special knowledge that its witness is testifying truthfully.” Id. (quoting State v. Chakouian, 537 A.2d 409, 412 (R.I. 1988)). Because defendant’s contentions concern testimony by a doctor as opposed to a government actor, the correct term in the instant case is bolstering, and thus we shall use that term.', '- 24 - credibility thereof does not constitute improper bolstering. See id. at 477; Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1033.', 'Further, we cannot agree with defendant’s contention that Dr. Goldberg’s testimony that she referred Jessica for follow-up treatment “effectively rubber-stamped” Jessica’s testimony. In the past, we have held that the testimony of a sexual abuse counselor who made repeated references to “sexual abuse recovery” while testifying to statements made by the victim during treatment, constituted improper bolstering. State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 906 (R.I. 1995). We reasoned that, because the counselor had no firsthand knowledge of the alleged sexual assaults and based her opinion solely on what she was told during treatment, her testimony “would be perceived by the jury as a conclusive opinion that [the victim] had testified truthfully.” Id. However, in Lynch, we held that a school psychologist’s testimony regarding statements made during treatment of an alleged sexual assault victim did not rise to the level of impermissible bolstering that was present in Haslam. Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1033. Because the psychologist was only identified generally as a school psychologist, there was no reference to “‘sexual abuse’ counseling”, she offered no opinion of the victim’s truth or credibility, and the victim herself testified to the events that took place, “the jury could not reasonably construe [the psychologist’s] testimony as vouching for the credibility of [the victim].” Id.', 'Here, Dr. Goldberg did not mention sexual assault treatment or counseling; she simply testified that she referred Jessica for “some follow-up treatment.” Furthermore, the jury had the opportunity to judge Jessica’s credibility firsthand when she herself testified to the allegations, thereby effectively eliminating whatever meager bolstering effect Dr. Goldberg’s testimony may have had. We are satisfied, therefore, that the admission of Dr. Goldberg’s testimony did not constitute improper bolstering.', '- 25 -', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because he overlooked and misconstrued relevant, material evidence and that the verdicts in the case failed to do substantial justice. The defendant asserts two specific grounds to support these contentions. First, defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked evidence tending to show that the sexual relationship between him and Jessica was not the product of force or coercion; he specifically refers to an exhibit admitted at trial depicting a Garfield 11 cartoon drawn by Jessica that she gave to defendant that read “To [defendant], From [Jessica] No Taco [Last Name].” Although Jessica testified at trial that “taco” was defendant’s word for her vagina and that the drawing was her way of telling defendant that she wanted the sexual contact to stop, defendant nevertheless avers that “the playful, teasing nature of the drawing dispels any notion that [Jessica] was controlled or manipulated by [defendant].”', 'Second, defendant argues that the trial justice misconceived an additional piece of evidence: a note written by Jessica indicating the sexual acts that she would submit to in order to be able to go back to school. The defendant contends that the list indicates that their relationship was “a two-sided sexual game” and that it “undermined the state’s theory with respect to psychological coercion.”', '1.

He then recounted the testimony of the six trial witnesses, as well as the content of defendant’s recorded statement.', '- 27 -', 'Upon reviewing the evidence before him, the trial justice concluded “that the verdict returned by the jury was correct and amply supported by credible evidence.” The trial justice was persuaded by Jessica’s testimony, in which “[s]he described a series of sexual assaults over a substantial period of time with clarity.” The trial justice was particularly impressed with the manner in which she testified, characterizing her testimony as “candid and forthright.” He accepted her testimony, finding that “[i]t is clear the defendant employed various forms of psychological coercion and control over [Jessica] throughout the period of these sexual assaults.”', 'The trial justice also considered defendant’s statement to the police, in which he “confirmed and corroborated many of the descriptive details provided by [Jessica].” Although he acknowledged that corroboration is unnecessary to a determination of guilt, he nevertheless found that “defendant’s voluntary statements bolster the accuracy and the veracity of [Jessica’s] version of the events she described.” He thereafter concluded “that the evidence clearly supports the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on all ten counts for first and second degree sexual assault.”', 'With respect to the Garfield drawing and the list of sexual acts, it is clear to us that, contrary to the defendant’s contention, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive this evidence in denying the motion for a new trial. Although the trial justice did not elaborate on the perceived significance of either of these pieces of evidence, given the context of the whole trial—which consisted of numerous corroborated accounts of a long history of sexual abuse—we cannot agree that this failure to fully elaborate constitutes overlooking or misconceiving evidence. Because the trial justice articulated adequate grounds for denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial, and was not clearly erroneous in doing so, we will not disturb his decision on appeal.', '- 28 -', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed, and the record of the case shall be returned to the Superior Court.', '- 29 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

25,State : v. : Anibal Acevedo. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. A jury convicted the defendant, Anibal Acevedo, of multiple counts of child molestation, and he appealed to this Court.', 'During the redirect- examination testimony of the complaining witness, who is a niece of the defendant’s girlfriend, the trial justice allowed some nonspecific testimony about previous, uncharged acts of sexual misconduct. Before this Court, Acevedo argues that the trial justice erred when she allowed the admission of the testimony about prior bad acts. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The complaining witness, Jennifer, 1 said that she first met defendant when she was approximately ten years old. Jennifer’s aunt and Acevedo lived together in Woonsocket with their only child; they would eventually have three children. According to her trial testimony, Jennifer and her siblings considered Acevedo to be their uncle. Jennifer would see defendant regularly when her extended family gathered, such as for birthdays and other holidays.', 'At trial, Jennifer testified about an incident that occurred when she was in the sixth grade. Jennifer was feeling ill and had been excused from school. The defendant picked her up because Jennifer’s mother was working and unable to do so. Jennifer testified that defendant brought her to the house that he shared with Jennifer’s aunt.', 'According to Jennifer, she retreated to her cousin’s bedroom when she and defendant arrived at his empty house. The defendant eventually brought some Vicks ointment, ostensibly to help with her illness. However, Jennifer testified that defendant rubbed the ointment on her back as well as her breasts. She said that as he rubbed her chest, defendant “caress[ed]” her breasts under her bra and that he began rubbing her vagina outside of her clothes.', 'Jennifer also told the jury that defendant then laid her down on the floor and positioned himself on top of her. She testified that defendant unbuckled her pants and penetrated her vagina with his penis. Jennifer described how she screamed because of the pain, and she said that after it was over there was “blood everywhere,” so defendant gave her a towel to clean up. Jennifer 1', 'We use a fictitious name to protect the identity of the complaining witness.', '-2- and defendant did not speak again that day, and when Jennifer’s mother retrieved her from defendant’s home, Jennifer did not reveal what had happened.', 'Jennifer also testified about another episode that occurred during the summer when she was between the sixth and seventh grades. Jennifer said that because defendant did not speak English, he would sometimes ask her to act as a translator for him. On one such occasion, Jennifer recollected, she was asked to accompany defendant to translate for him; it was her understanding at the time that they were going to an auto-parts store. Rather than going to the store, however, defendant drove Jennifer to a back road that did not have much traffic.', 'After parking and alighting from the car, defendant re-entered the vehicle through the passenger door and sat on the passenger seat with Jennifer. Jennifer testified that defendant then positioned himself behind her and touched her breasts and vagina. The defendant removed Jennifer’s pants and underwear and penetrated her vagina with his penis. She explained to the jury that, as after the first occurrence, she did not say anything at that time about what had occurred.', 'At trial, Jennifer also recalled for the jury that her behavior during her early teenage years became more and more problematic. Eventually, when she was sixteen or seventeen years old, she confided to a counselor about the incidents involving defendant. At that time, Jennifer also notified her mother about what she had experienced at the hands of defendant. Finally, when Jennifer was eighteen years old, she went to the police and reported the alleged abuse.', 'As a result of Jennifer’s complaint, Acevedo was charged with ten crimes: five counts of first-degree child molestation and five counts of second-degree child molestation. One count was dismissed before trial pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The remaining counts were reached for trial before a jury in February 2013.', '-3-', 'During Jennifer’s testimony, she was questioned about her statement to police. Jennifer confirmed during cross-examination that in the only statement she made to the police about defendant’s actions, she said that similar incidents “happened almost every other day” except on the weekends, when the rest of her family was around. 2 In response to cross-examination by defendant’s counsel, she conceded that the events had not actually happened every other day and, with respect to the number of occasions on which she claimed to have been assaulted, that she knew that the statement was inaccurate when she provided it to police. Jennifer explained, however, that it felt to her as though it happened every other day because she would see defendant that often; each time she saw him, her emotions would rise. Those feelings and those emotions, she said, were the basis of her statement.', 'After cross-examination, the attorneys and the trial justice conferred at sidebar. The prosecutor expressed his desire to ask Jennifer whether there had been other similar acts besides the two that she described in detail.', 'During that discussion, the prosecutor said that the testimony he wished to introduce would be admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 3 After she took a recess, the trial justice again addressed counsel at sidebar and explained that she would permit the testimony “so that the jury can get a full picture. This will be allowed to show the defendant’s common scheme and plan with respect to this victim, and it is relevant also to show his attitude regarding sexual activity toward the victim.” The trial 2', 'Jennifer had given similar testimony to the grand jury. 3', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides as follows:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to', 'prove the character of a person in order to show that the person', 'acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for', 'other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,', 'preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or', 'accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent bodily harm', 'and that the fear was reasonable.”', '-4- justice also said that she would limit the prosecution to rehabilitating the witness regarding her statement to police. She noted, however, that she was not going to permit the state to reopen its case-in-chief by eliciting testimony about events about which Jennifer had not been able to testify in detail. In an attempt to circumscribe the extent of the redirect examination, the trial justice queried the prosecutor about the questions he would ask, and the prosecutor confirmed that he had no intention of getting into the specifics of the other incidents. Acevedo’s attorney objected, arguing that such evidence would be inadmissible as propensity evidence.', 'On redirect examination, the prosecutor inquired of Jennifer whether there had been other times that defendant had touched her; she replied that it had happened other times during the same time period. However, she did not testify about the details of any other occasions. Indeed, the redirect examination was very brief:', '“[Prosecutor]: Were those the only two incidents, the two', 'incidents you testified about, were those the only two times that', 'Anibal Acevedo touched you?', '“[Jennifer]: Yes, I’m only talking about the ones that I do', 'remember, yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: Okay. Were there other times?', '“[Defense counsel]: Objection.', 'She’s asked—answered that', 'question.', '“The Court: Overruled.', '“[Prosecutor]: Were there other incidents, though?', '“[Jennifer]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: And did those times occur during that time frame', 'that you discussed?', '“[Jennifer]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: Middle school time frame?', '“[Jennifer]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: It’s fair to say you don’t know—were you keeping', 'count during that time?', '“[Jennifer]: No, that’s why it’s hard for me to remember.', '“[Prosecutor]: Were you marking on a calendar when they', 'occurred?', '-5-', '“[Jennifer]: No.” 4', 'At the conclusion of the state’s case-in-chief, the parties agreed that there was insufficient evidence on several of the remaining nine counts, and the trial justice granted a motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 2, 5, 8, and 9. Eventually, the jury convicted defendant on the five remaining counts that had been submitted to it: two counts of first-degree child molestation and three counts of second-degree child molestation.', 'On the counts of first-degree child molestation, the trial justice sentenced Acevedo to thirty years imprisonment, with twenty years to serve and the remainder suspended. On the counts of second-degree child molestation, the trial justice sentenced defendant to twenty-five years, with fifteen years to serve and the remainder suspended. The trial justice ordered that the sentences were to be served concurrently. Before this Court, defendant challenges only the ruling of the trial justice allowing the prosecution to rehabilitate the complaining witness by permitting questions about the inaccuracies in her police statement regarding the frequency of the incidents of molestation.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]he admissibility of evidence is a decision within the sound discretion of the trial justice * * * .” State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 199 (R.I. 2012) (citing State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 237 (R.I. 2008)). Thus, the trial justice’s decision will be affirmed unless he or she has abused that discretion. Id. 4', 'After that exchange, the trial justice imparted a limiting instruction to the jury, explaining that the evidence was admissible to show a design or plan. Defense counsel again objected, pointing out that there was nothing in the record that would support a theory that these incidents had been part of a design or common plan.', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Generally, “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.” Rule 404(b). We have clung to this principle in the context of molestation or sexual-assault cases, saying that “evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual misconduct cannot be admitted to prove that ‘defendant is a bad man, and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore, probably committed the offense with which he is charged.’” State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 806 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996)).', 'Evidence of other bad acts may be admissible, however, to prove something other than a defendant’s propensity. See Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806. Although this Court has not yet addressed the precise issues raised in this appeal, other courts have determined that the permissible purposes for the introduction of such evidence may include the rehabilitation of a witness. See, e.g., United States v. Bell, 624 F.3d 803, 810-11 (7th Cir. 2010); United States v. Span, 188 F. App’x 487, 491 (7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Holly, 167 F.3d 393, 395 (7th Cir. 1999); Hall v. State, 666 S.W.2d 408, 409 (Ark. Ct. App. 1984). In Bell, 624 F.3d at 810, a defendant on trial for a drug offense argued that rebuttal testimony that the defendant previously had asked the witness to cook five kilograms of crack cocaine was inadmissible prior-bad-act evidence. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the purpose of the evidence was not to show the defendant’s propensity to act in conformity with the prior acts, but rather to assail the defendant’s version of events. Id. at 810-11. In Holly, 167 F.3d at 395, the Seventh Circuit similarly allowed the government, in a mail-fraud prosecution, to question witnesses about intimidation by the defendant, which, it was argued, produced the witnesses’', '-7- earlier statements that the defendant had not been involved in the crime. The fact that the defendant intended to use the prior statements on cross-examination led the court to allow the prosecution to introduce the evidence of uncharged prior bad acts. Id.', 'Courts, moreover, have relied on the nature of redirect examination to allow the admission of a broader range of evidence than might have been admissible on direct examination. In United States v. Womochil, 778 F.2d 1311, 1315 (8th Cir. 1985), for example, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the admission of hearsay testimony “to clear up the false impression created on cross-examination.” The court explained that it had “repeatedly allowed the use of otherwise inadmissible evidence on redirect examination to clarify or complete an issue opened up by defense counsel on cross-examination.” Id. (citing United States v. Young, 553 F.2d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 959 (1977)). In United States v. Martinez, 775 F.2d 31, 37 (2d Cir. 1985), evidence was properly allowed on redirect examination even though the court accepted that the same evidence might have been inadmissible if it had been offered during direct examination. This is because “[e]vidence whose probative value might not be thought to outweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination may well be admitted during redirect examination ‘for the purpose of rebutting the false impression which resulted from * * * cross examination.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Finkelstein, 526 F.2d 517, 527 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 960 (1976)).', 'The challenged testimony in this case was offered to rebut an impression that may have arisen during defendant’s cross-examination of Jennifer about the veracity of her statement to the police that defendant molested her “almost every other day.” Because of the purpose for which the evidence was offered and the regulated and limited manner in which the testimony was elicited, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion. The evidence was not offered', '-8- to show defendant’s propensity to commit such acts. Rather, the state offered the testimony to correct any impression that might have been left on the jury that Jennifer had distorted the two incidents described during her direct examination when she told the police that defendant did this “every other day.” See Holly, 167 F.3d at 395; see also State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1127 (R.I. 2005) (allowing redirect-examination testimony offered “to correct the misleading impression created by [defense counsel’s] questioning of [a detective]”); cf. United States v. Cerno, 529 F.3d 926, 936 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Included among the other proper purposes for the admission of prior act evidence is impeachment.” citing United States v. Olivo, 69 F.3d 1057, 1065 (10th Cir. 1995)).', 'When she exercised her discretion as to the allowable extent of redirect examination, the trial justice was careful to limit the introduction of evidence of other bad acts. The record is clear that, after discussing the scope of redirect with both attorneys, the trial justice advised the prosecutor that he would not be allowed to stray from rehabilitating Jennifer’s credibility into testimony about occurrences that she had already admitted she did not remember in detail. The trial justice additionally forbade the state to get into the details of the other incidents during the redirect examination. Finally, the trial justice gave a limiting instruction in which she told the jury that defendant had not been charged for the acts mentioned on redirect and that they were not offered to prove that a crime had been committed.', 'The trial justice concluded that Jennifer had made an inconsistent statement, and, in allowing the state to educe testimony to rehabilitate the witness, she permitted the witness to testify about other nonspecific evidence of prior bad acts. That decision, in our opinion, was not an abuse of the trial justice’s broad discretion.', '-9-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

Both the note and the mortgage designate Bank of America as the “Lender,” and the mortgage additionally designates Bank of America as the “mortgagee.” The mortgage explicitly grants the “Lender” the statutory power of sale.', 'By letter dated February 19, 2010, Bank of America notified plaintiff of its intent to exercise its right to foreclose upon the property at a sale scheduled for April 21, 2010.

We discern no error in the trial justice’s conclusions.', 'The Legislature has addressed the required notice for foreclosure in two statutory provisions. The statutory power of sale—contained in G.L. 1956 § 34-11-22 and explicitly granted to Bank of America in the mortgage—allows a mortgagee to foreclose by first “mailing written notice of the time and place of sale by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagor, at his or her or its last known address” and “second, by publishing the same at least once each week for three (3) successive weeks in a public newspaper published daily in the city in which the mortgaged premises are situated * * *.” A mortgagee exercising the statutory power of sale is also allowed “to adjourn [a foreclosure] sale from time to time, provided that publishing of the notice shall be continued, together with a notice of adjournment or adjournments, at least once each week * * *.” Id. General Laws 1956 § 34-27-4(a), in turn, states that “if [a] sale is adjourned as provided in * * * § 34-11-22, * * * publication of the notice of the adjourned sale, together with a notice of the adjournment or adjournments, shall be 185 (R.I. 2008). As it happens, however, we indirectly address it in Section III-C of this opinion because in making this argument, plaintiff largely repeats all of his arguments concerning Bank of America’s alleged failure to hold the note at the time of the foreclosure sale.', '-8- continued at least once each week,” and “the sale, as so adjourned, shall take place during the same calendar week in which the last notice of the adjourned sale is published, at least one day after the date on which the last notice is published.”', 'There is no dispute here that plaintiff received proper notice from Bank of America of the original foreclosure sale and that notice of the adjourned sale was continuously published in the Kent County Daily Times on a weekly basis, with the last notice appearing the day before the sale actually took place.', 'The plaintiff’s subjective lack of awareness of the continued publication of these advertisements is irrelevant. We therefore agree with the trial justice that the undisputed facts demonstrated that the adjourned foreclosure sale was lawfully noticed.', 'C', 'Holder of the Note at the Time of Foreclosure', 'In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants submitted the affidavits of Ms. Jackson and Ms. Mason as proof that Bank of America held the note at the time of the foreclosure sale. In response, plaintiff submitted a letter purporting to be from counsel for BAC, Dilworth-Paxson, LLP (the Dilworth letter). The Dilworth letter stated that FHLMC owned the note as of July 6, 2010. The trial justice found that Bank of America’s affidavits were competent evidence under Rule 56(e), but he noted that defendants had failed to offer an explanation for the Dilworth letter. Accordingly, he stated there might be a genuine factual issue concerning who held the note at the time of foreclosure. The trial justice nevertheless concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because he deemed this factual issue immaterial.', 'The defendants contended below and reiterate on appeal that there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning Bank of America’s possession of the note. They maintain that', '-9- plaintiff’s affidavit and the Dilworth letter failed to meet the requirements of Rule 56(e). 11 Bank of America challenges the letter as “unattested to,” and Celtic likewise emphasizes that the Dilworth letter “was never verified or authenticated in any fashion.” We agree.', 'We have cautioned litigants that “unauthenticated documents * * * are not usually ‘competent evidence’ worthy of consideration by the court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Documents typically must be properly authenticated in order to qualify as admissible evidence.” Superior Boiler Works, Inc. v. R.J. Sanders, Inc., 711 A.2d 628, 632 n.3 (R.I. 1998) (citing Rule 901 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence). Authentication is not a high hurdle to clear: Rule 901(a) merely requires “evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.” This Court has taken a flexible and pragmatic approach to Rule 901 by allowing “a document’s authenticity [to] be established in any number of different ways.” 12 Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 996 A.2d 684, 691 (R.I. 2010).', 'For summary-judgment purposes, the “task [of authentication] can be accomplished in the usual course by submitting an affidavit of a person 11', 'Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires that:', '“Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal', 'knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in', 'evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent', 'to testify to the matters stated therein.

The plaintiff here did not offer proof of any of these circumstances.', '- 10 - with personal knowledge of the documents who can attest to their authenticity and qualify them as admissible evidence.” Superior Boiler Works, Inc., 711 A.2d at 632 n.3; see Charles Alan Wright et al., 10A Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 2722 at 382-84 (1998) (“To be admissible, documents must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of Rule 56(e) and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence.”).', 'Here, plaintiff made no attempt to authenticate the Dilworth letter in any manner or by any means. The only affidavits he submitted were his own. Each of these affidavits goes no further than to swear that he “reviewed a QWR * * * response from Dilworth Paxson, LLP on behalf of BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, dated July 6, 2010.” In these circumstances, even a flexible approach to authentication will not stretch so far as to allow consideration of the Dilworth letter. We therefore conclude that plaintiff failed to submit any competent evidence to counter Bank of America’s evidence that it held the note at the time of foreclosure. 13 Given this failure, summary judgment was appropriate. Accordingly, although we disagree with the trial justice’s suggestion that there may have been a genuine factual issue concerning the holder of the note, we nonetheless uphold his decision to grant summary judgment by following “our precedent of ‘affirm[ing] the orders and judgments of a trial court when * * * there are other valid reasons to support the order or judgment appealed from.’” Levine v.

(Bilray) appeals from a Superior Court judgment 1 granting the motion of the plaintiff Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC (Berkshire) to vacate an arbitration award. This case came before the Supreme Court on May 8, 2014 pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'General contractor Berkshire entered into an agreement with subcontractor Bilray to perform work on a project located in Bristol, Rhode Island. 2 A dispute arose between the parties 1', 'Although the relevant statute, G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12, refers only to an “order” vacating an arbitration award, both an order and a judgment entered in this case. 2', 'The facts in this section were culled from the arbitrator’s decisions and plaintiff’s complaint, as well as the parties’ briefs and appendices.', '-1- when Berkshire issued Bilray a notice of termination in April 2010. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties submitted the dispute to arbitration.', 'Both parties submitted claims to the arbitrator for monetary damages. In particular, Berkshire sought to recover completion costs from Bilray. Bilray, in turn, requested the balance on the contract price, which totaled $112,240, and/or damages for additional work it had completed on the project.', 'Berkshire objected to Bilray’s claims and sought to have them dismissed on the grounds that Bilray had signed a waiver and release of all claims for labor, materials, and work performed prior to March 25, 2010. 3 The release upon which Berkshire relied contains the following relevant provisions:', '“3. That prior to the date thereof, [Bilray] has received', 'payment in full for, and has fully satisfied, except as noted below,', 'all debts and obligations incurred in the performance of the work', 'on the project (including without limitation all [Bilray’s] and', 'subcontractor debts for labor, materials, supplies, rentals,', 'insurance, utilities, permits, taxes, pensions, benefits, Social', 'Security (hereinafter ‘Work Debts’) through the 16th day of March', '2010.

The arbitrator does not indicate the dates for Bilray’s other claims.', '-2-', '“5. That [Bilray] has made all payments due for work', 'performed and materials provided to the extent covered by', 'payments previously received bye [sic] [Bilray] for work in', 'connection with the Project, except for the amounts unpaid to the', 'below listed parties * * *.” 4 The typewritten word “NONE” appears in the space provided below paragraph 5 of the release.', 'Berkshire asserted that the release unambiguously waived any and all of Bilray’s claims arising prior to March 25, 2010. In making this argument, Berkshire relied on this Court’s decision in Gustafson v. Max Fish Plumbing & Heating Co., 622 A.2d 450 (R.I. 1993) (Max Fish), in which we held that a subcontractor’s execution of a release unambiguously waived any and all claims for labor, materials, and subcontracted work.', 'See id. at 452.', 'Berkshire specifically argued that the release which Bilray signed was even more stringent than the release at issue in Max Fish.', 'In a written decision dated June 26, 2012, the arbitrator rejected Berkshire’s argument that the release barred Bilray’s claims. The arbitrator began his analysis by noting that the release at issue in Max Fish “differ[ed] materially” from the release executed by Bilray. He then analyzed the specific language of Bilray’s release.', 'Pointing to the language concerning indemnification in paragraph 3 of the release, he determined that paragraph 3’s protections inured only to the benefit of the owner and premises, and not to Berkshire’s benefit. The arbitrator went on to consider paragraph 4. The arbitrator stated that it was not clear whether paragraph 4 released claims only against the owner or additionally released claims against Berkshire. He ultimately concluded, however, that this uncertainty was immaterial because the “release language of [p]aragraph 4 expressly applies only to the items embodied in the 4', 'Although Berkshire focused on the March 25, 2010 release, it additionally submitted to the arbitrator copies of three prior releases that contained nearly identical language and were dated February 25, 2010, January 29, 2010, and December 24, 2009.', '-3- requisition of [March 25, 2010].” The parties, the arbitrator pointed out, had not submitted a copy of the requisition referenced in the release. He reasoned that, without such a copy, he could not determine whether the release would operate to bar the claims which Bilray had submitted for arbitration. Accordingly, the arbitrator concluded that “the evidence * * * is insufficient to warrant a finding that the * * * [r]elease extinguished Bilray’s claims.” 5', 'The arbitrator proceeded to consider the merits of the parties’ dispute and their claims for damages in a second written decision, dated July 26, 2012.', 'He found that Berkshire’s termination of Bilray was wrongful. The arbitrator granted Bilray $136,949.04 in damages but allowed Berkshire a set-off of $40,599, 6 resulting in a net award to Bilray of $96,350.04.', 'Berkshire filed a complaint 7 in Providence County Superior Court seeking to vacate the arbitrator’s award pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12. After Bilray objected to the motion to vacate, a hearing on Berkshire’s motion was held before a Superior Court trial justice on September 11, 2012. In a decision rendered that same day, the trial justice found that the release unambiguously waived all claims before March 25, 2010 with no exceptions. He suggested that the arbitrator’s interpretation of the release had changed the wording of that document. Upon comparing the language of paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the release with the language of the release at issue in Max Fish, the trial justice agreed with Berkshire that the release in the instant case was more stringent than the release in Max Fish. He concluded that the arbitrator had manifestly disregarded the law. Accordingly, the trial justice granted Berkshire’s motion to vacate the 5', 'The arbitrator did not explicitly address paragraph 5 of the release in his decision. 6', 'The arbitrator allowed Berkshire one claimed expense of $40,599, which represented the replacement cost of loam that Bilray had allegedly removed from the project and failed to return. 7', 'The provisions of chapter 3 of title 10 alternatively refer to an action in Superior Court to review an arbitration award as being commenced by “application” and “motion.” In the instant case, plaintiff filed a complaint, and the matter was docketed in the Superior Court as a miscellaneous petition.', '-4- arbitration award. An order and a judgment vacating the arbitration award entered the following day, September 12, 2012. Bilray timely appealed to this Court. 8', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Rhode Island has a strong public policy in favor of the finality of arbitration awards. See North Providence School Committee v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 344 (R.I. 2008). “Parties voluntarily contract to use arbitration as an expeditious and informal means of private dispute resolution, thereby avoiding litigation in the courts.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Grabbert, 590 A.2d 88, 92 (R.I. 1991). To preserve the integrity and efficacy of arbitration proceedings, judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely limited. Aponik v. Lauricella, 844 A.2d 698, 704 (R.I. 2004). “[P]arties who have contractually agreed to accept arbitration as binding are not allowed to circumvent an award by coming to the courts and arguing that the arbitrators misconstrued the contract or misapplied the law.” Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Flynn, 687 A.2d 440, 441 (R.I. 1996).', 'The “policy of finality is reflected in the limited grounds that the Legislature has delineated for vacating an arbitration award.” Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d at 441. In reviewing an arbitrator’s award, this Court, like the Superior Court, follows § 10-3-12. See City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 532 (R.I. 2008). That statute provides in pertinent part, “the court must make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration * * * [w]here the 8', 'The same day that Bilray filed its notice of appeal, Berkshire filed a motion to confirm the portion of the arbitration award that granted it $40,599 in damages. Bilray objected to the motion to confirm. The parties appear to disagree as to whether the Superior Court judgment from September 12, 2012 vacated the entire arbitration award or just the part of the award granting Bilray damages. This disagreement, however, is immaterial for the purposes of the instant appeal.', '-5- arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Section 10-3-12(4). An arbitrator may exceed his or her authority by giving an interpretation that fails to draw its essence from the parties’ agreement, is not passably plausible, reaches an irrational result, or manifestly disregards a provision of the agreement. See, e.g., City of Newport v. Lama, 797 A.2d 470, 472 (R.I. 2002); Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951, AFT v. Woonsocket School Committee, 770 A.2d 834, 837 (R.I. 2001); Department of Children, Youth and Families v. Rhode Island Council 94, AFSME, 713 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998). A court may also vacate an arbitrator’s award when the arbitrator has manifestly disregarded the law. Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d at 442. “[E]very reasonable presumption in favor of the award will be made.” Feibelman v. F.O., Inc., 604 A.2d 344, 345 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Coventry Teachers’ Alliance v. Coventry School Committee, 417 A.2d 886, 888 (R.I. 1980)). A party claiming that an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority bears the burden of proving that contention. See Coventry Teachers’ Alliance, 417 A.2d at 888.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Bilray contends that the trial justice improperly vacated the arbitrator’s award. Berkshire counters that the vacation of the award was proper because the arbitrator exceeded his authority by manifestly disregarding both the law as articulated in Max Fish and the plain language of the release. Bilray, in contrast, characterizes the arbitrator’s decision as a thoughtful analysis of both the relevant language of the release and this Court’s decision in Max Fish.', 'Berkshire’s arguments here largely mirror those advanced by the plaintiff in this Court’s decision in Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d 440 (hereinafter Prudential). In Prudential, the plaintiff argued that the manner in which a panel of arbitrators calculated', '-6- prejudgment interest manifestly disregarded both the parties’ contract and prior decisions of this Court. See Prudential, 687 A.2d at 442. The plaintiff conceded, however, that the arbitrators had analyzed this Court’s relevant decisions and found them distinguishable. See id.', 'In rejecting the plaintiff’s arguments and refusing to vacate the award in Prudential, this Court emphasized the unique nature of the review of an arbitrator’s decision by highlighting an important distinction between our review in an ordinary case and our review of an arbitrator’s decision: We explained that, “[w]ere th[e] matter initially decided by a trial justice in the Superior Court, we would not be bound by § 10-3-12 and the policy favoring finality in arbitration, and we would be able to construe and apply the relevant * * * case law.” Prudential, 687 A.2d at 443. When, however, a decision has been rendered by an arbitrator, the decision is “insulated from the normal appellate review for errors of law.” Id. Accordingly, having concluded in Prudential that the arbitrators did not manifestly disregard the law, we “express[ed] no opinion on the merits of the underlying dispute.” Id.', 'The distinction we emphasized in Prudential bears repeating here, especially in light of Berkshire’s reliance on Max Fish. In Max Fish, the matter came before this Court after the general contractor-plaintiff had filed suit in the Superior Court seeking to enjoin the defendant from pursuing arbitration of its claims on the grounds that the execution of a release waived all of the defendant’s claims. See Max Fish, 622 A.2d at 451. A Superior Court trial justice found the release to be ambiguous and construed it against the drafter. See id. at 452. We disagreed with the trial justice’s finding of ambiguity and reversed based upon our independent conclusion that the release unambiguously precluded the defendant from proceeding with arbitration. 9 See id. 9', 'Ordinarily, “the various principles of the law of contracts govern the judicial approach to a controversy concerning the meaning of a particular release.” Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 558 (R.I. 2009) (explaining that “[a] release is a contractual agreement”). Thus, in an ordinary or non-arbitration case, the construction of a clear and unambiguous release would be a question of law to be decided by the trial justice and reviewed', '-7-', 'In contrast, the instant case comes to us after an arbitrator has already rendered an interpretation of the parties’ release, which interpretation resulted in the issuance of an award that the parties agreed would be final and binding. When we review an arbitrator’s decision, we do not engage in our usual de novo review of contracts and other questions of law. Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 64 A.3d 734, 741 (R.I. 2013). The deference due to the arbitrator is such that an arbitrator’s mere error of law is insufficient grounds to vacate his award. 10 See Bradford Dyeing Association, Inc. v. J. Stog Tech GMBH, 765 A.2d 1226, 1232 (R.I. 2001). To vacate an arbitrator’s decision, we must conclude that the arbitrator has manifestly disregarded the law. “[A] manifest disregard of the law requires something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrator[] to understand or apply the law.” City of East Providence v. International Association of Firefighters Local 850, 982 A.2d 1281, 1286 (R.I. 2009) (quoting North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344). A manifest disregard of the law occurs when an arbitrator “understands and correctly articulates the law, but then proceeds to disregard it.” City of Cranston, 960 A.2d at 533 (quoting North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344).', 'In arguing that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law, Berkshire challenges the arbitrator’s determination that Max Fish is not dispositive of the instant case. Berkshire specifically de novo. Lennon v. MacGregor, 423 A.2d 820, 822 (R.I. 1980); Young, 973 A.2d at 558. As we explain above, however, we do not employ our ordinary standard of review in the instant case because the matter comes before this Court, as it came before the Superior Court, upon review of an arbitrator’s decision. 10', 'In 1929, when the General Assembly enacted the legislation that is now chapter 3 of title 10, it failed to include a mistake of law as one of the enumerated statutory grounds for vacating an arbitration award. See Bradford Dyeing Association, Inc. v. J. Stog Tech GMBH, 765 A.2d 1226, 1232 n.8 (R.I. 2001). Previously, at common law, an arbitrator’s error of law present on the face of the award was sufficient to vacate the award. See id. (citing Harris v. Social Manufacturing Co., 8 R.I. 133, 139 (1864)). This Court concluded that the omission of mistake of law from the legislative enactment was “convincing evidence that [the General Assembly] did not intend that an award under the statute should be open to question on that ground.” Loretta Realty Corp. v. Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Co., 83 R.I. 221, 226, 114 A.2d 846, 849 (1955).', '-8- points to this Court’s conclusion in Max Fish that a general contractor was entitled to rely upon a subcontractor’s waiver of all claims because the subcontractor had executed a release in order to induce the general contractor to make payment. Berkshire insists that it is entitled to the same reliance. According to Berkshire, the release in the instant case is more stringent than the release at issue in Max Fish.', 'Although Berkshire’s recitation of our reasoning in Max Fish is accurate, none of Berkshire’s arguments suffice to vacate the arbitrator’s award. The arbitrator here compared the release that Bilray executed with the release in Max Fish and determined that the two releases “differ[ed] materially.” From our perspective, such an analysis does not show a disregard for our caselaw but rather strikes us as an earnest attempt to interpret Bilray’s release in light of our holding in Max Fish. See North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344 n.9 (noting that, if an award contains an “honest decision,” we will not set it aside for an error of law or fact); see also Prudential, 687 A.2d at 442 (rejecting argument that arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law where the plaintiff conceded that arbitrators distinguished this Court’s precedent).', 'Our independent estimation of whether Bilray’s release is more or less stringent than the release in Max Fish is irrelevant since we conclude that the arbitrator’s decision neither is irrational nor manifestly disregards the law.', 'In making its second argument that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the release, Berkshire points to several alleged errors on the part of the arbitrator that it asserts were sufficient grounds for the trial justice to vacate the award. In particular, Berkshire argues that the arbitrator overlooked relevant language in the release when he interpreted that document as only inuring to the benefit of the owner and the premises. Berkshire additionally argues that the arbitrator misconstrued the release by concluding that Bilray had waived claims to only those sums included in the March 25, 2010 requisition. According to Berkshire’s interpretation of the release, Bilray waived claims for all labor, materials, and work performed up to and including the date of the requisition.', '-9-', 'These arguments amount to little more than Berkshire’s disagreement with the arbitrator’s interpretation of the release.', 'Even if we were to agree with Berkshire’s interpretation, such agreement would not give us license to uphold the trial justice’s vacation of the award. As we have explained, review of an arbitration award does not permit “judicial re-examination” of the relevant contractual language. Jacinto v. Egan, 120 R.I. 907, 912, 391 A.2d 1173, 1175 (1978). It is the arbitrator’s judgment for which the parties have bargained and by which they have agreed to abide. See id. at 911, 391 A.2d at 1175. Accordingly, an arbitrator’s misconstruction of an agreement is not a sufficient basis for vacating an award. Reynolds v. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 9, 475 A.2d 1041, 1043 (R.I. 1984). Only when the arbitrator’s decision rises above the high-water marks of implausibility, irrationality, manifest disregard, or failure to draw its essence from the agreement may a court intervene and strike it down.', 'In the instant case, the arbitrator unmistakably attempted to ground his analysis in the language of the parties’ release. He cited extensively to that document and analyzed its language in detail. We are satisfied that the arbitrator’s decision shows all due regard for the parties’ release, sufficiently draws its essence therefrom, and does not reach an irrational result. Accordingly, the arbitrator’s decision should have been allowed to stand.', 'In a last attempt to persuade us to uphold the vacation of the award, Berkshire cites to several cases concerning waivers and releases from this jurisdiction and others. If we were at liberty to re- examine the arbitrator’s decision de novo, we might find the cited cases instructive. Given our circumscribed scope of review, however, such cases merit no consideration here. 11 11', 'None of the cases that Berkshire relies upon involved the review of an arbitrator’s construction of a release.', '- 10 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff, Janet Coit, named in her official capacity as director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), appeals from an order of the Superior Court in favor of the defendants, John, Alfred, and Anna Tillinghast adopting the report of a master and ordering that the master’s findings be implemented. 2 The root of the dispute arises from the operation of the 1', 'At the time the present action was filed in Superior Court, Timothy R.E. Keeney was the director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). The caption has been revised to reflect the current director pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 2', 'In their opposition to the contempt motion in the Superior Court, defendants claimed that Alfred Tillinghast had passed away “several years” previously. The defendants also disclosed that John Tillinghast had not been a signatory to the “Consent Agreement” that is at issue in this case. Nonetheless, we shall continue to refer to the parties as “defendants” or “the Tillinghasts.”', '-1- Bowdish Lake Camping Area in Glocester and Burrillville, and more specifically, from the establishment of five campsites located in Burrillville near Wilbur Pond.', 'To assist in ameliorating the contentious relationship between the parties, a justice of the Superior Court appointed a master to resolve the issues in dispute, issues that stem from a consent agreement signed by the parties in 1998. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 13, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we deny and dismiss the appeal because it is not properly before us.', 'Facts and Travel', 'According to defendants, in the early 1970s the Tillinghasts worked with the United States Soil Conservation Service to develop Bowdish Lake Camping Area.', 'The facility, consisting of 400 campsites in Glocester and Burrillville, opened in 1973. From that point on, however, the sailing was less than smooth. In 1975, storm clouds first appeared after DEM issued the first of many notices of violations to defendants for alleged transgressions of G.L. 1956 § 2-1-21, a statute within the Freshwater Wetlands Act. 3 Over a twenty-five-year period, a 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 2-1-21 says, in relevant part,', '“(a)(1) No person, firm, industry, company, corporation, city,', 'town, municipal or state agency, fire district, club, nonprofit', 'agency, or other individual or group may excavate; drain; fill;', 'place trash, garbage, sewage, highway runoff, drainage ditch', 'effluents, earth, rock, borrow, gravel, sand, clay, peat, or other', 'materials or effluents upon; divert water flows into or out of; dike;', 'dam; divert; change; add to or take from or otherwise alter the', 'character of any fresh water wetland as defined in § 2-1-20 without', '-2- pattern developed whereby DEM would notify the Tillinghasts of alleged environmental violations, both formally and informally, defendants would respond with an explanation, and DEM would not take further action for several years.', 'On February 5, 1997, after defendants allegedly violated a DEM-issued cease-and-desist order by continuing to conduct dredging activity on the lake bed of Bowdish Lake, DEM filed the instant action in Superior Court. In their answer, defendants asserted that their actions were predicated on a written determination by DEM in 1974 that the dredging did not violate the Freshwater Wetlands Act. On March 25, in an apparent resolution of the conflict, the parties signed a consent agreement, in which the Tillinghasts agreed that they would “not undertake any future dredging activity in Bowdish Lake without prior application and written approval of [DEM].” Furthermore, the parties agreed that DEM’s February 1974 permit “as it relate[d] to any and all dredging rights, [wa]s [t]hereby null and void.” It is significant that the March 1997 consent order resolved only a handful of the many ongoing issues between the parties.', 'In an effort to resolve all the outstanding points of contention, some of which involved controversies that spanned two decades, the parties executed a second consent agreement on August 5, 1998. 4 That agreement addressed four specific alleged violations and outlined the actions the Tillinghasts would take to remedy them. One of those violations, which is the subject of this appeal, concerned the five campsites at Wilbur Pond. The defendants agreed that by June 1999, they would restore the vegetation that had been cleared within a fifty-foot zone of the pond, unless defendants applied for permission, and received approval, to have the campsites remain within the perimeter. The agreement acknowledged that defendants had developed the', 'first obtaining the approval of the director of the department of', 'environmental management.” 4', 'The 1998 consent agreement specified that the Superior Court would “retain[] jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this [o]rder.”', '-3- campsites “under what [they] believed was a valid permit issued before regulations were enacted.” 5', 'Unfortunately, the 1998 consent agreement did not achieve the harmony that it sought. In March 2000, DEM filed a motion to adjudge defendants in contempt for failing to implement certain aspects of the 1998 order. In May of that year, a justice of the Superior Court ordered defendants to restore the vegetation within fifty feet of Wilbur Pond, which was the location of the five campsites, or submit an application to DEM to alter the wetlands as had been agreed to in the 1998 agreement. In 2008, DEM filed a new motion to adjudge defendants in contempt for failure to comply with the 1998 consent agreement. Finally, in September 2009, the parties executed a new consent order in which they agreed to the appointment of Scott Rabideau as master to resolve “all issues relating to and contained in th[e] * * * [c]onsent [a]greement dated July 31, 1998 between the parties, and [o]rder of May 3, 2000.” 6 In accordance with the parties’ agreement, the court appointed the master and ordered him to “prepare a report and make recommendations to the [c]ourt,” setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law, if required. The master was further instructed to submit a draft report to both parties for comment before submitting a final report to the court. 5', 'Although the General Assembly passed G.L. 1956 part 2 of chapter 1 of title 2, the Freshwater Wetlands Act, in 1971, the authority to promulgate regulations in accordance with the act was granted as part of a 1974 amendment. Compare P.L. 1971, ch. 213, § 1 (establishing “Fresh Water Wetlands” Act) with P.L. 1974, ch. 197, § 1 (amending “Fresh Water Wetlands” to include authority to promulgate rules and regulations). 6', 'The 2009 consent order specifically listed the following as issues to be decided by the master:', '“All issues raised by Plaintiff in its Motion to Adjudge Defendant', 'in Contempt; effect of the April 4, 1973 letter issued in application', 'F-401, pertaining to clearing swamp and damming streams to', 'create pond; beach maintenance and dredging issues including', 'application 01-0089 as the same are still in dispute; together with', 'any other issue this [c]ourt deems proper for resolution at this', 'time.”', '-4-', 'The master submitted the draft report in January 2010. Not surprisingly, given the litigious history of this matter, DEM filed various objections. After the court heard arguments in February and March 2010, the trial justice ordered either the Tillinghasts, the master, or both, to restore the wetlands in the vicinity of the five campsites around Wilbur Pond and ordered that the campsites remain closed until the restoration was complete. The master was also required to submit his report and recommendation to DEM as an application to alter the wetlands around the campsites. DEM was to consider this application in accordance with its regulations and render a decision, which would be reviewed by the trial justice. The 2010 order further specified that the Superior Court would retain jurisdiction in this matter “at all times.”', 'On June 10, 2010, the master filed an application with DEM, which included the same analysis and recommendations as the draft report. The application concluded that, because of the limited scope and location of the campsites, a minimum twenty-five-foot perimeter of wetland around Wilbur Pond, and the vegetative cover around and between the campsites, the five campsites did “not represent a random, unnecessary, or undesirable disturbance to state jurisdictional freshwater wetlands.” After conducting its review, DEM denied the application on August, 30, 2011. DEM concluded that the five campsites were undesirable and against the public interest, and noted that the application did not demonstrate how adverse environmental impacts would be “avoided to the maximum extent possible.”', 'The defendants then filed a motion asking that the trial justice approve the master’s report, and the court heard argument relating to the appropriate burden of proof. The defendants argued that, according to Rule 53(e)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, in nonjury actions, the trial justice “shall accept the master’s findings of fact unless clearly', '-5- erroneous.” 7 DEM retorted that the master’s submission was not the type of report that resides within the scope of Rule 53 because it was not prepared and filed with the court, but with DEM, and therefore, it “should be reviewed in accordance with the standards of [DEM’s] regulations and with the [s]tate’s Freshwater Wetlands Act[.]” However, the trial justice ruled that the master’s application to DEM would be considered as the proposed final report and that DEM would be saddled with the burden to prove that the master’s findings of fact were clearly erroneous.', 'On August 30 and 31, 2012, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing with respect to the master’s application. Martin Wencek, a supervisor of DEM’s freshwater wetlands program, testified that he reviewed the master’s application and that he, along with other senior staff, made the decision to deny it. Wencek said that he had concluded that the five campsites would “result in loss of wildlife habitat and disturbance to wildlife,” which “would change the character of the existing wetland.” Wencek also testified that the application lacked a substantive exploration of alternatives that would avoid any impact on the wetlands as required under 12-190-028 R.I. Code R. 10.02D.(1) of DEM’s rules and regulations governing the administration and enforcement of the Freshwater Wetlands Act. 8 7', 'Rule 53(e)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure says, “The master shall prepare a report upon the matters submitted to the master by the order of reference and, if required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, the master shall set them forth in the report.” 8', '12-190-028 R.I. Code R. 10.02D.(1), entitled “Application to Alter Freshwater Wetland,” includes the following:', '“Avoidance: All persons must satisfactorily demonstrate to the', '[d]epartment in the form of a written narrative that all probable', 'impacts to freshwater wetlands functions and values have been', 'avoided to the maximum extent possible. The written narrative', 'must describe what steps were taken to avoid impacts to freshwater', 'wetlands.” The rule continues to list six minimum areas that the applicant must consider and address.', '-6-', 'Rabideau, the master, testified that the 2010 consent agreement directed him to oversee the restoration of the five campsites and to submit an application to DEM to alter the freshwater wetlands. Rabideau indicated that DEM had availed itself of the opportunity to inspect the restoration and that DEM had determined that the wetlands around the five campsites had been restored to its satisfaction.', 'He also claimed that he had addressed all portions of Rule 10.02D.(1), but he had not included an alternative-location analysis for the campsites because the 2010 agreement instructed him to file an application to alter the freshwater wetlands for the specific perimeter where the five campsites were located.', 'On March 20, 2013 the trial justice issued a bench decision on defendants’ motion that he accept the report of the master.', 'The trial justice concluded that the master’s report and accompanying plans constituted findings of fact that would be upheld unless they were shown to be clearly erroneous, in accordance with Rule 53(e)(2). He asserted that he believed that this case, distilled to its essence, amounted to a difference of opinion between the master and DEM. He then noted that such a difference, in the context of an administrative appeal, would normally be resolved in favor of the agency. However, the trial justice reasoned that because this was not an administrative appeal, DEM bore the burden of proving that the master’s findings were clearly erroneous, noting that the parties had agreed to the appointment of the master to resolve all issues between them. The trial justice held that because DEM had failed to satisfy its burden, he would adopt the master’s report, and he ordered that the master’s findings be implemented. The order memorializing the trial justice’s ruling was filed on April 10, 2013. DEM filed a timely appeal to this Court. 9 9', 'We note that, generally, appellate review of denials by administrative agencies are heard pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15 under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The 2010', '-7-', 'The parties came before a single justice of this Court pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A(3) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure on February 10, 2014. As a result of that conference, the parties were directed to file supplemental memoranda to specifically address the issue of whether the “[o]rder of April 10, 2013 was interlocutory, and thus not appealable.” Before this Court, DEM argues that the order is appealable because the master decided to address each of the four issues between the parties in turn by publishing separate reports pertaining to each. DEM also argued that, even if the order were determined to be interlocutory, the Court should decide the appeal nonetheless because the “five-campsite” issue has sufficient finality and because the 2013 order creates imminent and irreparable harm that may impact other orders in the case. We disagree. For the reasons outlined below, we conclude that the April 2013 order is interlocutory and therefore not properly before us.', 'Discussion', 'We must first address whether this appeal is properly before the Court at this time. The Tillinghasts maintain that it is not; they argue that the appeal is interlocutory because the April 2013 order is not a final judgment, but merely the first action by the master to address the remaining issues between the parties. DEM concedes, both in its written submissions and at oral argument, that there are three outstanding issues pending in Superior Court that the parties agreed the master would resolve. However, DEM contends that Rabideau’s decision to handle each of the four issues separately resulted in a final resolution after a hearing on the merits on the campsites issue and that, consequently, the April 2013 order should not be considered interlocutory. order said that the Superior Court retained jurisdiction at all times; however, the retention of jurisdiction would not have precluded the trial justice from deciding the case under the APA.', '-8-', 'We have held that “[i]nterlocutory orders are those that are provisional or temporary, or that decide some intermediate point or matter but are not a final decision of the whole matter.” Simpson v. Vose, 702 A.2d 1176, 1177 (R.I. 1997) (mem.). “Generally, interlocutory orders are not subject to review unless the order or decree falls within one of the exceptions set forth in G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7 * * * .” 10 Cayer v. Cox Rhode Island Telecom, LLC, 85 A.3d 1140, 1146 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Chiaradio v. Falck, 794 A.2d 494, 496 (R.I. 2002)). Moreover, there is a second type of exception that is “judicial in origin.” Boranian v. Richer, 983 A.2d 834, 837 (R.I. 2009). This familiar exception says that “an order may fall within the ambit of our judicially created rule that permits review of an interlocutory order that has such an element of finality as to require immediate review by this Court to avoid possible injurious consequences.” Chiaradio, 794 A.2d at 496 (citing McAuslan v. McAuslan, 34 R.I. 462, 472, 83 A. 837, 841 (1912)). In those situations, we will review interlocutory orders “before the case is finally terminated in order to prevent clearly imminent and irreparable harm.” Town of Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 118 R.I. 644, 648, 375 A.2d 410, 412-13 (1977). In Ross v. Mencoff, 82 R.I. 461, 465, 111 A.2d 356, 358 (1955), the complainant appealed the denial of a contempt motion for failure to produce records to a temporary receiver whom the trial justice appointed. We held that because the case required further proceedings and did not meet any of the above-mentioned exceptions, the appeal was not properly before the Court. Id. at 465, 111 A.2d at 358. 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-24-7 provides as follows:', '“Whenever, upon a hearing in the [S]uperior [C]ourt, an', 'injunction shall be granted or continued, or a receiver appointed, or', 'a sale of real or personal property ordered, by an interlocutory', 'order or judgment, or a new trial is ordered or denied after a trial', 'by jury, an appeal may be taken from such order or judgment to the', '[S]upreme [C]ourt in like manner as from a final judgment, and the', 'appeal shall take precedence in the [S]upreme [C]ourt.”', '-9-', 'After a thorough review of the record, we reach a similar conclusion here. The order that DEM appealed is not final; it is merely an order confirming the master’s report and does not set forth the ultimate resolution of the parties’ disputes. It is significant that this report is the first action undertaken by the master with respect to the four issues that the parties agreed that he would resolve. We find no precedent, and none is provided by DEM, to support the proposition that because the master decided to address each of these complicated points separately, the case has somehow become “bifurcated” into separate and distinct cases to such a degree that would render the adoption of his report on the first issue to be the equivalent of a final judgment. In our opinion, the 2013 order does not possess a sufficient element of finality to be appealable and is thus interlocutory.', 'In the alternative, DEM invites this Court to invoke the holding of McAuslan because the 2013 order raises the specter of imminent and irreparable harm, and as a result, it should be reviewed now. DEM argues that the master’s decision with respect to the five campsites has an impact on other environmental issues in the case, and it urges that without this Court’s review, DEM will not be able to effectively protect Rhode Island’s natural resources at the Bowdish Lake Camping Area. However, DEM offers no explanation of what grave harm might come from the recognition of five campsites that have been in place for nearly four decades. We can discern no imminent and irreparable harm from the master’s approval of the five campsites because the trees and other vegetation at issue were cleared long ago. In our opinion, there is simply no need to hear this appeal now, and to do so when there are remaining issues between these profusely litigious parties would encourage the sort of piecemeal adjudication of disputes that the final-judgment rule is designed to avoid.

The Parking Co., L.P., 892 A.2d 87, 95 (R.I. 2006).', '- 10 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the appeal of the interlocutory order confirming the master’s report is denied and dismissed.

The Rhode Island State Police filed two petitions in Family Court against respondent in connection with that incident: (1) a petition alleging that respondent was wayward due to having committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the misdemeanor offense of carrying a concealed knife with a blade over three inches in length, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-42(a)(1);3 and (2) a petition alleging that respondent was delinquent due to having committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute an assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. A trial was held before a justice of the Family Court in October and November of 2011. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of James Paschal', 'The complaining witness, James Paschal, was the first witness to testify. It was his testimony that he had previously been engaged to respondent’s older sister (M.S.) and that, while they were engaged, he had lived with M.S.’s family and shared a room with respondent.', 'Mr. Paschal testified that, on May 5, 2011, he was working as a counselor at the above- referenced camporee. He further testified that, at approximately 11:15 p.m. on that date, he and M.S. and an attendee of the camporee named Aldwyn Montaque were searching for respondent, who had stayed out past the time of curfew. Mr. Paschal stated that, when they found respondent near one of the camp’s outbuildings, M.S. asked him to return her cell phone (which she had previously lent to him). He said that respondent proceeded to hold the cell phone above his head while M.S. tried to jump up in an attempt to get it out of her brother’s hand. It was Mr. Paschal’s 3', 'In a bench decision rendered on December 16, 2011, the trial justice found that the state had failed to prove that respondent had carried a concealed knife with a blade over three inches; accordingly, he ruled that respondent was not wayward.', '-2- testimony that an altercation between M.S. and respondent ensued, during which respondent “elbowed [M.S.] in the face,” causing her to fall and hit the ground. Mr. Paschal testified that he then intervened by grabbing respondent from behind and pulling him away from M.S. On cross- examination, Mr. Paschal acknowledged that he had “initiated the first physical contact” with respondent. He further testified that, when he let respondent go, respondent punched him in the face and “busted [his] bottom lip.” He stated that he then “put [respondent] on the ground” so that respondent was lying on his stomach; and he added that, at that point, he was “kind of on top [of respondent and] behind him.”', 'According to Mr. Paschal’s testimony, respondent said: “Get off me,” “I have a knife;” Mr. Paschal added that he felt a knife when he reached for respondent’s hand. He stated that thereafter M.S. came over and tried to take the knife out of respondent’s hand and that respondent “end[ed] up cutting her.” Mr. Paschal further testified that respondent “started slashing at [him]” and that he “felt something hit [him] in [the] head;” he added that, although he tried to disarm respondent, he was unable to do so. It was Mr. Paschal’s further testimony that, when he “released a little pressure” on respondent, respondent turned him over and was on top of him. He proceeded to testify, however, that he was able to “flip” respondent over, so that respondent was once again underneath him at which point respondent was pointing the knife at Mr. Paschal’s neck and was trying to push it in. He stated that, because blood from one of the cuts on his face that had been inflicted by the knife was blurring his vision and he feared that he “would be in big trouble” if he could not see, he hit respondent twice “in the head.” He added that, as a result, respondent stopped struggling. It was further Mr. Paschal’s testimony that, thereafter, campground security and the police arrived. When Mr. Paschal was asked whether,', '-3- “other than the two hits on the back of his head,” he attempted to strike respondent in any way, he answered in the negative.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Aldwyn Montaque', 'Aldwyn Montaque, who was sixteen years old at the time of trial, testified next. He stated that, on the night at issue, he assisted Mr. Paschal and M.S. in their search for respondent. He testified that, when the trio found respondent near one of the camp’s outbuildings, M.S. and respondent proceeded to argue about her cell phone, which he said respondent would not return to her; he added that he saw respondent hit M.S. “[i]n the face” with the palm of his hand but that M.S. did not fall to the ground as a result of the blow. He further testified that respondent then began to run while being pursued by Mr. Paschal, who “tackled him to the ground.” According to Mr. Montaque’s testimony, Mr. Paschal was sitting on respondent’s back and said to respondent: “[I]f you pull your knife out on me, I will hit you.” He stated that respondent then pulled out his knife and “started wrestling [and] fighting” with Mr. Paschal. Mr. Montaque initially testified that Mr. Paschal “hit [respondent] because the knife was out;” however, when Mr. Montaque was asked by the trial justice, after the prosecutor’s redirect examination, how he knew that to be true, he responded: “I don’t exactly know that.” He further testified that, while he and M.S. were urging the two men to stop fighting, he saw Mr. Paschal hitting respondent, who was “shoving, like mad, * * * trying to cut him.” He stated that M.S. was trying to pull the two combatants apart when respondent “accidentally cut” her hand. Mr. Montaque stated that Mr. Paschal pinned respondent down, while he (Mr. Montaque) ran to alert security about what was happening.', '-4-', 'C', 'The Testimony of Brenda Kruger', 'Brenda Kruger, a staff member at the camporee, was called by the defense. She stated that, on the night in question, she was in her tent when she heard a male voice repeatedly yelling: “Get off of me.” She further stated that she walked toward the source of the “commotion,” at which point she observed a male lying on the ground with another male on top of him. Ms. Kruger testified that she saw the “person on top punch the person on the bottom;” she added that she saw the arm of the male on top “go up and down twice” and then “go up and down twice again.” It was Ms. Kruger’s testimony that, when she turned around so that she might “go get help,” she heard the words “blood” and “knife.” She added that she had “heard enough that [she] knew a knife had come out.”', 'D', 'The Testimony of M.S.', 'The respondent’s sister, M.S., was also called by the defense. She testified that, on the night of May 5, 2011, while she was working as a counselor at the camporee, Mr. Paschal, Mr. Montaque, and she searched for and found her brother near one of the camp’s outbuildings. She added that, after she asked respondent to return her cell phone, he moved it out of her range and asked her to wait. M.S. testified that, in response, she “grabbed him by his ear and slapped him on the side of his face,” at which point respondent pushed her off with his arm. According to her testimony, Mr. Paschal then grabbed respondent “around his front from behind” and told him not to hit his sister. It was her further testimony that respondent tried to get away from Mr. Paschal but that Mr. Paschal threw him to the ground. She testified that, at that point, Mr. Paschal was', '-5- on top of respondent, who was lying face down on the ground; she added that Mr. Paschal was demanding that respondent give him the cell phone.', 'In M.S.’s estimation, Mr. Paschal’s behavior was “becoming violent * * * and forceful.” She stated that Mr. Paschal began choking respondent and “saying threatening things.” She further stated that, because she had become “extremely concerned,” she said to Mr. Paschal: “Are you trying to kill him?” She testified that Mr. Paschal replied that respondent had a knife; she added that Mr. Paschal said: “I’m from the street. I know how to choke people who pull knives on people.” She further testified, however, that she did not see respondent holding a knife until after Mr. Paschal “started hitting [respondent] or * * * knocking his head against the ground.”', 'It was M.S.’s further testimony that she then saw blood but that she was not sure where it was coming from—although she stated that Mr. Paschal said that respondent was “stabbing” him. She testified that, at that point, Mr. Paschal was “punching [respondent] and hitting him in the head.” According to her testimony, she did not see respondent cut Mr. Paschal, but she added that she thought that Mr. Paschal “was being very aggressive and unnecessarily so” since he was “significantly larger” than respondent;4 she added that, in her opinion, Mr. Paschal could “easily” have overpowered respondent and “de-escalated the situation by just immobilizing him.” 4', 'Mr. Paschal testified that, at the time of the incident, he was six feet tall and weighed approximately one hundred and seventy pounds. The respondent testified that, at the time of the incident, he was five feet eight inches tall and weighed approximately one hundred and twenty- five pounds.', '-6-', 'E', 'The Testimony of Respondent', 'The respondent, who was fifteen years old at the time of trial, testified in his own defense. He testified that, earlier on the night in question, he had borrowed M.S.’s cell phone and that, when she asked him to return it, a struggle ensued. He stated that, after M.S. tried to take her cell phone from him, he told her to “just wait” and that he “pushed her off.” He further stated that Mr. Paschal, who he said was also present, then “grabbed him from behind * * * in a restraint position” and stated: “[Y]ou don’t hit your sister.” The respondent stated that Mr. Paschal asked him for M.S.’s cell phone and that he responded by telling Mr. Paschal to wait; he added that, instead, Mr. Paschal “threw [him] on the ground” so that he ended up face down on the ground with Mr. Paschal on top of him. He testified that Mr. Paschal then proceeded to “try[] to take the phone.” According to respondent’s testimony, Mr. Paschal “started to become a little more forceful in trying to take the phone;” he added, however, that, at that point, Mr. Paschal was not hurting him.', 'The respondent further stated that, after he and Mr. Paschal struggled “for a little bit,” Mr. Paschal began holding him down “more forcefully” and that, at that point, he told Mr. Paschal “to get off of [him].” It was his testimony that Mr. Paschal then started choking him by placing his arm around his neck, which “restrict[ed] [his] breathing majorly.” He testified that he was “kind of shocked” and that he told Mr. Paschal that he could not breathe and asked him: “Are you going to kill me?” He stated that he heard Mr. Paschal say “something about a knife”—although he said that, at that time, his knife was still in his pocket. It was his further testimony that Mr. Paschal said, “Don’t pull your knife on me” and also said that he was “from the streets.” The respondent testified that, at that point, he was “really scared;” he explained that', '-7- what caused him to be “really scared” was the just-quoted comment by Mr. Paschal, which respondent said reminded him of the violent acts that Mr. Paschal had previously told him about having committed.', 'The respondent testified that Mr. Paschal then started punching him. He described his own state of mind as follows:', '“I had no clue why he would want to knock me out. I felt like he', 'was going to break my neck or something like that, so I felt the', 'only way I could * * * look out for my own safety * * * was to do', 'something, the last resort I had was the knife on me. If I pulled it', 'out and held it to him and still kept saying ‘get off of me,’ maybe', 'he would take that seriously and move for his own good, so that’s', 'what I did.” He testified that, even though he held the knife to Mr. Paschal’s side and told him to “get off of [him],” Mr. Paschal continued punching him, stating that he was “not getting off of him.” He further testified that, as a result of being struck by Mr. Paschal, he was “kind of exhausted and * * * dizzy” and was “pretty terrified.” The respondent stated that M.S. told Mr. Paschal to “get off of” him and that she tried to grab the knife; he added, however, that he did not give his sister the knife because he “didn’t know what [Mr. Paschal] was going to do.”', 'The respondent stated that he then held the knife to the back of Mr. Paschal’s neck— although he denied “try[ing] to” or “intend[ing] to cut” him. He additionally testified that he recalled Mr. Paschal, M.S., and Mr. Montaque talking about blood, but he said that he “couldn’t see what was happening” or “where the blood was.” He stated that, when he realized that the knife had not “worked to de-escalate the situation at all,” he stopped struggling.', 'The respondent testified that, at some point prior to the May 5 incident, Mr. Paschal had spoken to him about “how he was in a gang” and had told him that he “was a leader in the gang to some degree;” he added that Mr. Paschal had told him that he “carried a gun” or “had a gun.”', '-8- He further testified that Mr. Paschal had specifically told him about an occasion when “he and another one of his friends had taken this guy, cornered him in a bathroom * * * and they beat him up and broke his ribs.”5 He stated, however, that he had never seen Mr. Paschal act violently prior to the May 5 incident and that he “didn’t think of [Mr. Paschal] as a violent person;” he further stated that he was surprised and shocked by Mr. Paschal’s behavior on May 5.', 'F', 'The Adjudication of Delinquency', 'On December 16, 2011, the trial justice found that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent committed an assault with a dangerous weapon, and he adjudicated him delinquent with respect to that offense. In due course, the trial justice placed respondent on probation “until further order of the court” and ordered him: (1) “to cooperate with anger management * * * [and] family counseling;” (2) to send a written apology to the complainant; and (3) to perform fifty hours of community service. The respondent filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'On appeal, respondent contends that the trial justice was clearly wrong “in deciding that the state had disproved [his defense of] self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing findings of fact by a trial justice in a delinquency adjudication, we apply a deferential standard of review. In re Richard A., 946 A.2d 204, 209 (R.I. 2008); In re Ryan B., 5', 'On cross-examination, Mr. Paschal conceded that he had previously been a member of a gang and that he had disclosed that fact to respondent and his family; however, he denied telling respondent that he used to carry a gun or mentioning an incident in which he “broke someone’s ribs in a bathroom.”', '-9- 739 A.2d 232, 235 (R.I. 1999). On appeal, this Court reviews the record “to determine therefrom whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.” In re Malik D., 730 A.2d 1070, 1072 (R.I. 1999); see also In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d 1216, 1220 (R.I. 2010). This Court has stated that, in view of our substantial deference to the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury, we “will not disturb those findings unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 209; see also In re David G., 741 A.2d 863, 865 (R.I. 1999).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Because the central issue on appeal is whether the state presented sufficient evidence to disprove respondent’s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, we begin our analysis by briefly summarizing the law in this jurisdiction regarding the defense of self-defense. This Court has articulated the legal principles with respect to the defense of self-defense as follows:', '“Under the law relating to self-defense, one may defend', 'oneself whenever one reasonably believes that he or she is in', 'imminent danger of bodily harm at the hands of another. Such a', 'person, having the fear, need not wait for the other to strike the', 'first blow. However, such a person must use only such force as is', 'reasonably necessary for his own protection. The permissible', 'degree of force used in defense of oneself varies with the particular', 'set of circumstances in which he or she acts, but in no set of', 'circumstances may one apply more than that degree of force', 'necessary to prevent bodily injury.” State v. Linde, 876 A.2d', '1115, 1129 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also', 'State v. D’Amario, 568 A.2d 1383, 1385 (R.I. 1990).', 'Prior to resorting to the use of deadly force to protect oneself, however, one “must attempt to retreat if [he or she is] consciously aware of an open, safe and available avenue of escape.” State v. Silvia, 836 A.2d 197, 200 (R.I. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); see', '- 10 - also State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 1288 (R.I. 2006). In addition, “one may not invoke the doctrine of self-defense if he or she has instigated the combative confrontation.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 631 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Martinez, 652 A.2d 958, 961 (R.I. 1995). This Court has stated that the “very essence of the defense of self- defense is how the defendant perceived the situation at the time of the incident in question.” Urena, 899 A.2d at 1288 (internal quotation marks omitted). When determining whether a defendant’s actions were lawful in this context, we have recognized that a consideration of factors such as his or her physical condition or youth may be appropriate. See State v. Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990, 993, 994 (R.I. 1990); In re Paul F., 543 A.2d 255, 257, 258 (R.I. 1988). Furthermore, “[i]t is well settled that a defendant who contends that he or she acted in self- defense is entitled to present evidence that the victim had a reputation for being violent in order to show that the defendant’s fear of injury was reasonable or to show that the victim was the aggressor.” State v. Cotty, 899 A.2d 482, 494 (R.I. 2006); see, e.g., State v. Ventre, 811 A.2d 1178, 1182 (R.I. 2002); State v. Soto, 477 A.2d 945, 949 (R.I. 1984). “Once a defendant has satisfied the burden of presenting sufficient evidence to raise the issue of whether he or she [acted] in self-defense, it becomes the state’s burden to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Lopez, 943 A.2d 1035, 1045 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1012 (R.I. 2005).', 'Bearing in mind these principles relative to self-defense, we turn next to the trial justice’s findings in his bench decision, several of which respondent challenges on appeal. The trial justice found that the “believable, credible evidence” proved that respondent could “clearly” have ended the confrontation between Mr. Paschal and him by returning his sister’s cell phone but that, “in a rush of either testosterone or stubbornness, he struggled with the bigger and older', '- 11 - [Mr. Paschal] rather than surrender the cherished media device.” The trial justice credited the testimony of Mr. Paschal with respect to that confrontation, stating that “the believable, credible evidence” indicated that Mr. Paschal “just held [respondent] down and * * * did not choke him or punch him until the knife was pulled.” In contrast, the trial justice chose to reject certain aspects of respondent’s testimony; he found respondent’s testimony that he accidentally cut Mr. Paschal to be “totally lacking in credibility,” and he found that respondent had “intentionally inflicted [Mr. Paschal’s] wounds by slashing at him with the knife.” Additionally, the trial justice found that respondent “admit[ted] that he was not afraid * * * of” Mr. Paschal because, despite being aware of at least one prior incident of violence allegedly perpetrated by Mr. Paschal, respondent testified that he “did not consider [him] to be a violent person.”', 'It was the trial justice’s opinion that “the believable, credible evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that [respondent] did not believe he was in imminent danger of bodily harm.” He noted that the camporee was actually a church outing, where help was readily available. He also noted that respondent was not threatened with deadly force at any point on the night in question, “yet [he] utilized [deadly force] in a juvenile attempt to win the dispute.” The trial justice stated that, in his view, respondent had pulled out the knife “as a means of getting his way, not defending himself.” He concluded that respondent had utilized excessive force in attempting to repel Mr. Paschal and that respondent’s use of deadly force was not justified under the law of self-defense.', 'Based on a careful review of the record, it is our judgment that there was sufficient legally competent evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that the state disproved beyond a reasonable doubt respondent’s defense of self-defense and the trial justice’s adjudication of respondent as delinquent for having committed an assault with a dangerous weapon. It is true', '- 12 - that respondent, whose testimony was corroborated by that of his sister, testified that Mr. Paschal was punching and choking him when he pulled out the knife. But the record also contains Mr. Paschal’s testimony that, although he had been restraining respondent, he did not hit respondent until after respondent had injured him with the knife.', 'Mr. Paschal’s testimony was not contradicted by the testimony of either Mr. Montaque or Ms. Kruger. Thus, the testimony elicited at trial could justifiably be viewed by the trier of fact as indicating that Mr. Paschal was attempting to hold respondent down in order to immobilize him rather than with the intent to cause him injury. In our opinion, the state introduced sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent, by cutting Mr. Paschal with a knife, used an amount of force beyond that “degree of force that is necessary to prevent bodily injury” under the attendant circumstances—and, as we have previously stated: “One who uses excessive force is [to be] held accountable for his or her actions.” Urena, 899 A.2d at 1288.', 'On appeal, respondent contends that “[t]he trial justice was clearly wrong in deciding that the state had disproved self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.” The respondent specifically contends that the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence in making the following findings: (1) that respondent could have ended the matter “by just giving [the phone] back;” (2) that the camporee “was a church outing where help was readily available;” (3) that respondent did not fear Mr. Paschal due to the fact that he had a positive relationship with him and did not regard him as a violent person; (4) that Mr. Paschal did not choke or punch respondent until the knife was pulled; and (5) that respondent used deadly force “in a juvenile attempt to win a dispute.” All of these challenged findings, however, were either not material to the trial justice’s determination that respondent’s use of deadly force was unreasonable or were supported by what the trial justice found to be the credible evidence adduced at trial. Given the', '- 13 - deferential standard of review that this Court affords to the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a delinquency adjudication, we are unable to conclude that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong with respect to his findings or his conclusion that respondent did not act in justifiable self-defense during the incident at issue. In our view, respondent’s appeal is primarily a challenge to the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of certain witnesses—namely, Mr. Paschal and respondent. But, as we have stated before: “This Court consistently has held that factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are granted an extremely deferential standard of review.”', 'State v. Gianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 2011); see also State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 780, 781 (R.I. 2012); State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010).', 'Having closely scrutinized the record and bearing in mind the well-settled principles that govern our review in this context, we perceive no reason to disturb the ruling of the Family Court.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court.

30,Gail M. Bober : v. : David R. Bober.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. In this contested and at times acrimonious divorce action, both parties find grist for the appellate mill in the trial justice’s comprehensive decision dissolving their twenty-four-year marriage. The defendant, David R. Bober, appeals from the decision pending entry of final judgment on the grounds that: (1) the trial justice overlooked or misconceived the medical evidence relating to the plaintiff’s medical condition; (2) the trial justice erred by awarding alimony to the plaintiff that could “turn into ‘lifetime’ alimony”; (3) the trial justice overlooked or misconceived evidence in arriving at the property distribution award; and (4) the trial justice erred by retroactively applying a modification of child support in violation of G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.2.', 'The plaintiff, Gail M. Bober, cross-appeals, arguing that the trial justice erred by failing to award her: (1) attorney’s fees; (2) a sixty-percent share of the equity in a house defendant’s mother transferred to defendant and his sister; and (3) lifelong medical coverage. Further, she contends that the trial justice’s “sua sponte amended alimony award” is inequitable to her and contrary to previous holdings of this Court. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in', '-1- part and reverse in part the decision pending entry of final judgment entered by the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiff and defendant were married on June 22, 1985. They had one child, a daughter, born February 14, 1994. On March 16, 2007, plaintiff filed a complaint for divorce; defendant filed an answer asking that the complaint be dismissed, as well as a counterclaim for divorce. A trial commenced on December 1, 2008. On the fourth day of trial, the trial justice, having heard testimony from two neurologists concerning the symptoms that plaintiff was experiencing caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) and having observed plaintiff on the witness stand, appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to assess whether plaintiff “ha[d] the capacity to continue on with this trial, to understand proposals said to her, to comprehend proposals.” On February 10, 2009, the GAL reported that plaintiff was “able to proceed fully and competently” subject to a recommended daily time limitation of three hours to plaintiff’s testimony. 1 Trial resumed on March 6, 2009, and testimony concluded on March 11, 2009.', 'After multiple motions and continuances, the trial justice filed a seventy-page written decision on March 30, 2010.', 'The decision summarized the medical testimony regarding plaintiff’s diagnosis of MS and reviewed the parties’ assets, income, and expenses. The trial justice then ordered defendant to pay child support in the amount of $850 per month, including an adjustment for the difference between that amount and the amount previously paid by defendant as temporary support, retroactive to June 1, 2009. The trial justice ordered defendant 1', 'The GAL also recommended that “subject to the rules of evidence, [plaintiff] be allowed to use any notes she has prepared in order to refresh her recollection” and recommended that the trial justice consider holding the trial in chambers, an invitation the trial justice declined.', '-2- to pay alimony to plaintiff in the amount of $250 per week, terminating upon the death of plaintiff or defendant, plaintiff’s remarriage, or upon the retirement of both plaintiff and defendant. Finally, the trial justice performed an equitable distribution of the marital assets, awarding sixty percent to plaintiff and forty percent to defendant of all marital assets, save for the parties’ respective “pension/retirement plans”; those he awarded fifty percent to each party by means of Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDRO).', 'After the trial justice issued his decision, at least three hearings were held on motions for clarification of the decision. At one such proceeding on April 21, 2010, the trial justice noted that plaintiff would continue to receive the benefit of defendant’s medical coverage under his retirement plan. There was further discussion regarding one bank account (the “Orion” account), which defendant alleged was a premarital asset and plaintiff argued was a marital asset. The trial justice directed the parties to refer to the exhibits in order to determine the date the account was opened.', 'At a hearing on June 17, 2010, after engaging in a colloquy regarding the termination of alimony, the trial justice amended his decision to allow for the termination of alimony upon defendant’s retirement date, irrespective of whether plaintiff is retired. The trial justice ruled that, upon defendant’s retirement, alimony would cease and plaintiff would receive fifty percent of defendant’s pension. Also on June 17, 2010, defendant argued that plaintiff’s withdrawal of $6,000 had not been accounted for in the court’s distribution of marital assets. The defendant again argued that the Orion account was not a marital asset, and the trial justice granted a brief adjournment in order for counsel for both parties to find an exhibit that would establish when the account was opened. Upon returning to the court, plaintiff’s counsel represented that there was no such exhibit in evidence.', '-3-', 'Further hearings were held on July 20, July 22, and August 3, 2010, during which the trial justice went through most of the provisions in the proposed decision pending entry of final judgment. On August 3, 2010, the trial justice entered the decision with the following provisions pertinent to this appeal: (1) alimony is to terminate on the earliest occurrence of plaintiff’s death or remarriage, or defendant’s death or retirement; (2) plaintiff was awarded sixty percent of the Orion account, with the remaining forty percent to the defendant; (3) defendant was awarded all right, title, interest, and liability in the house he shared with his mother; (4) defendant is to pay child support of $850 per month, retroactive to June 1, 2009, with a lump sum payment of $2,077.05 representing the difference between the award of $850 per month and the previous child support order of $150 per week for the period of June 1, 2009 to April 1, 2010.', 'A final hearing on an outstanding motion, not pertinent to this appeal, was conducted on August 12, 2010. At that time, the trial justice made a minor correction to the order and signed and dated the amendment. The defendant filed a notice of appeal on August 27, 2010, and plaintiff cross-appealed on August 30, 2010. 2 Final judgment was entered on September 27, 2011.

(quoting Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 217-18). “Questions of law in an appeal from the Family Court, however, are reviewed de novo.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived the medical evidence relating to plaintiff’s medical condition. Further, defendant asserts that the alimony award was erroneous because it could “turn into ‘lifetime’ alimony” because the termination of alimony is linked to defendant’s retirement rather than the retirement of both parties. The defendant also argues that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived the expenses of both parties in making the award of alimony.', 'Additionally, defendant challenges the property distribution, contending that the trial justice failed to consider plaintiff’s dissipation of the marital assets, failed to account for plaintiff’s unilateral withdrawal of marital funds, and overlooked evidence that the Orion account was a premarital asset. Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by retroactively applying a modification of child support in violation of § 15-5-16.2.', 'In her cross-appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by failing to award her attorney’s fees and a sixty-percent share of the equity in a house that defendant’s mother transferred to defendant and his sister. Further, plaintiff asserts that the trial justice erred by failing to award her lifelong medical coverage.', 'A. Medical Evidence', 'The trial justice dedicated eleven pages of his decision to a summary of the testimony regarding plaintiff’s diagnosis of MS. The plaintiff’s treating physician, Dr. Salvatore Napoli, testified that plaintiff suffered from “a form of [MS]” that has caused her “some mild to', '-5- moderate cognitive issues” including “difficulties with multitasking [and] processing information.” Doctor Napoli testified that plaintiff’s illness falls within the “relapsing/remitting” category of MS and that she will require some form of treatment for the remainder of her life. According to Dr. Napoli, plaintiff is presently treating her MS with a medication that costs approximately $10,000 per month, but he stated that the copay for the medication is likely around $40-$60 per month. Doctor Napoli testified that, in his opinion, plaintiff is not able to work full-time, but that she could work part-time; he stated that he would consider thirty hours per week to be part-time. Finally, Dr. Napoli noted that he could not make a prediction about plaintiff’s prognosis because “[t]hat’s the tricky part of this disease. You can’t make a prediction about it, about where it can go.”', 'The defendant’s expert, Dr. Elaine Jones, agreed that plaintiff has the relapsing/remitting category of MS. Doctor Jones characterized the relapsing/remitting form of MS as the type with the most favorable prognosis. However, Dr. Jones admitted that there are no generally accepted tests that can accurately “predict” the prognosis of patients with MS.', 'In his decision, the trial justice stated that “[Dr. Napoli]’s opinion is that the plaintiff has primary progressive Multiple Sclerosis.” That is a misstatement; the experts were in accord that plaintiff has relapsing/remitting MS. The defendant argues that the trial justice misconceived the evidence of plaintiff’s diagnosis and thus concluded that she had the form of MS with the least favorable prognosis, leading him to base his property distribution and alimony award on a fundamental error. Although we agree that the characterization of plaintiff’s expert’s opinion was an error, in order to conclude that this error is “fundamental,” we would need to disregard the totality of the trial justice’s analysis.', 'Not only did the trial justice exhaustively and accurately recount the experts’ testimony concerning both the manifestations of plaintiff’s illness', '-6- and the effects of her disability, but also, in the text leading up to the mischaracterization of her diagnosis, the trial justice correctly stated:', '“Based upon reasonable medical certainty, [Dr. Napoli] was of the', 'opinion that the current stage in [plaintiff’s] disease of Multiple', 'Sclerosis is ‘the relapsing category.’ There is a new area of', 'inflammation. He feels that she is in remission but that there are', 'hidden things going on which may not be detectable in a relapse.', 'He has prescribed Copaxon therapy for her gait instability. There', 'are daily injections to prevent inflammation. With respect to his', 'prognosis, the doctor testified that this is the tricky part of the', 'disease as you cannot make predictions.” In determining the alimony award, the trial justice found that “plaintiff has a need for supplemental income and that the [d]efendant has the capacity to pay supplemental income in the nature of spousal support/alimony.” The trial justice noted that plaintiff’s need for support was due to her working on a part-time basis, and he stated that “[h]er reason has been set forth in detail by this [c]ourt in its analysis of the [p]laintiff’s health condition and her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.” Notably, the seventy-page decision contains multiple references to MS and several references to relapsing/remitting; the term “primary progressive” appears but once.', 'It is apparent to us that the trial justice based his decision on the uncontradicted medical testimony that plaintiff suffers from MS and is capable of working part-time, and that there is no way to “predict” her prognosis. The mischaracterization of plaintiff’s diagnosis in one sentence was an unfortunate error, but it was not the basis of the trial justice’s decision. 3 3', 'We note that, at the April 21, 2010 hearing, when the parties sought clarification of the trial justice’s decision, defense counsel inquired about this issue, stating somewhat obliquely, “I don’t recall seeing a specific finding by your Honor to include language that, quote, the [c]ourt found that her medical condition was permanent in nature.” The trial justice stated twice that he “never used the word ‘permanent,’” explaining that for both the equitable distribution and alimony award he referred back to his lengthy discussion of plaintiff’s diagnosis of MS, including testimony that “if she follows the right regimen and takes the right medication she should be able to lead a fruitful life.”', '-7-', 'B. Child Support', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice’s retroactive application of child support was a modification in violation of § 15-5-16.2(c)(2). 4 On January 28, 2008, a consent order was entered awarding temporary weekly child support of $150 to plaintiff. This order was made “without prejudice to the rights of either party to contest the amount of the child support at the time of the trial on the merits.” On October 16, 2009, plaintiff filed a motion for modification of the child support award. No hearing was held on the motion for modification. In his decision in 2010, the trial justice made findings of fact and awarded child support of $850 per month, or $197.67 per week, retroactive to June 1, 2009. 5 The defendant argues that, pursuant to § 15-5- 16.2(c)(2), the 2010 child support order could only be made retroactive to October 16, 2009.', 'At a hearing on January 8, 2010, the trial justice made clear that he was not acting on any motion, stating that “[t]here is no motion for modification. * * * This is a hearing de novo as to what is needed. You never really had a real hearing on the [child support of] 150.” The trial justice noted that, although the trial had concluded, he had not made an order on child support, saying:', '“yes, you’ve given me some stipulations. Stipulations don’t go to', 'the essence * * * of the issues * * * I wanted to get evidence in to', 'show what her needs are. * * * That’s what I’m doing here in this', 'hearing, getting financial data up to date, because it’s changed', 'from the trial, because the house has been sold.” 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16.2(c)(2) states in pertinent part:', '“After a decree for support has been entered, the court may', 'from time to time upon the petition of either party review and alter', 'its decree relative to the amount of support and the payment of it,', 'and may make any decree relative to it which it might have made', 'in the original suit. The decree may be made retroactive in the', 'court’s discretion only to the date that notice of a petition to', 'modify was given to the adverse party * * * .” 5', 'This date is immediately subsequent to the parties’ submission of posttrial memoranda, including a Child Support Guideline.', '-8-', 'Although there had been an agreed temporary child support award, no Child Support Guidelines Worksheet had been submitted and considered until just before June 1, 2009. “General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16.2(a) provides that the Family Court ‘shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to pay an amount based upon a formula and guidelines adopted by an administrative order of the family court.’” Waters v. Magee, 877 A.2d 658, 665 (R.I. 2005).', 'Therefore, at the January 8, 2010 hearing, the trial justice was considering the award for the first time and, as he made clear, he was not acting on any motion for modification. We hold that it was not an abuse of discretion to award child support retroactive to June 1, 2009, rather than to the date that plaintiff filed a motion for modification.', 'C. Medical Coverage', 'In her cross-appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in not awarding her “lifelong health coverage.” The trial justice held that defendant was to maintain plaintiff on his medical insurance plans; upon defendant’s retirement, he noted, plaintiff would continue to be covered under defendant’s retirement plan. The plaintiff argues that, due to her MS diagnosis, she is “irreparably vulnerable” if her medical coverage is terminated by defendant’s remarriage or “subsequent collective bargaining changes or political climate.” In declining to make the health coverage award permanent, the trial justice noted that medical insurance is a form of alimony and, should plaintiff’s health coverage be terminated, “[n]othing provided in * * * § 15- 5-16[] shall affect the power of [the] [c]ourt as subsequently provided by law to alter, amend, or annul any order of alimony previously entered.”', '“While a Family Court justice has the discretion to enter an award of continuing health care coverage, * * * once such an award has been entered, [G.L. 1956] § 27-20.4-1 is triggered,', '-9- regardless of whether § 27-20.4-1 specifically has been referenced in the final judgment of divorce.” 6 L’Heureux v. L’Heureux, 770 A.2d 854, 856 (R.I. 2001). We have stated that:', '“The clear and unambiguous language of § 27–20.4–1 requires that', 'health insurance benefits, when provided for in a final decree of', 'divorce, continue at no cost to the former spouse of the party', 'participating in the plan as long as the plan participant is still a', 'member of the plan and until (1) either party remarries, or (2) a', 'time provided by the judgment of divorce. Furthermore, the', 'continuation of the original plan coverage shall cease when the', 'former spouse becomes eligible to participate in a comparable', 'health plan through his or her own employment.” L’Heureux, 770', 'A.2d at 857.', 'Given the dictates of § 27-20.4-1, it would appear that the only avenue open to plaintiff, should her medical coverage cease, would be to seek a modification of alimony. Even were we to, as plaintiff asks, “specifically state that she has a need for lifelong health insurance” and that “she is not foreclosed from seeking health coverage (or additional alimony to cover the cost thereof),” the effect would be no different—plaintiff would still need to seek a modification of her alimony award. Accordingly, it was not error for the trial justice to decline to award lifelong medical coverage.', 'D. Equitable Assignment of Property', 'The defendant argues that the property distribution was erroneous because the trial justice erred by: (1) failing to consider plaintiff’s dissipation of the marital assets; (2) failing to credit 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 27-20.4-1(a) states in pertinent part:', '“[T]he person who was the spouse of the party prior to the entry of', 'judgment for divorce may remain eligible for continuing benefits', '* * * as long as the original member is a participant in the plan', '* * * and until either one of the following shall take place: (1) the', 'remarriage of either party to the divorce, or (2) until a time as', 'provided by the judgment for divorce.” Further, “[i]f the person who was the spouse * * * becomes eligible to participate in a comparable plan * * * through his or her own employment, the continuation of the original plan coverage shall cease.” Section 27-20.4-1(a).', '- 10 - defendant for monies he paid towards marital debt; (3) failing to consider that plaintiff unilaterally withdrew funds and used the marital line of credit to pay her attorney’s fees; (4) overlooking evidence that the Orion account was premarital property; and (5) failing to include the value of the marital furnishings in the sixty/forty equitable distribution equation.', '1. Dissipation of Marital Assets', 'The defendant asserts that plaintiff dissipated marital assets by not responding to a would-be buyer’s offer of $300,000 for the marital domicile. Because the house eventually sold for $279,000, defendant argues that plaintiff’s “stonewalling tactics” cost the marital estate $21,000. The house had been listed at a price agreed to by the parties of $354,900. The plaintiff asserts that this lapse was due to both parties’ complete inability to communicate, and she notes that, when a later offer was made on the house, defendant counter-offered at $317,000. It seems clear that whatever loss may have been realized on the sale of the house was due to the lamentable and all-too-typical acrimony that accompanies a divorce, rather than any willful dissipation of assets. The defendant also asserts that plaintiff’s refusal to file joint income tax returns in 2008 resulted in a loss to the marital estate, because she received a refund of $2,066, whereas he owed $4,481. However, plaintiff acted within her rights in electing to file separately, and again, the loss suffered is part of the sad cost of a contentious divorce, not a willful dissipation of the marital estate.', '2. Payments Made From Marital Assets', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred by overlooking evidence that plaintiff paid her attorney’s fees out of the marital line of credit and by not crediting defendant for the $40,851 he paid towards marital expenses, as well as the $6,000 unilateral withdrawal that plaintiff made prior to filing for divorce. Specifically, defendant takes issue with the trial', '- 11 - justice’s decision to split sixty/forty the $74,694.96 that defendant withdrew unilaterally from the marital accounts, without first subtracting those sums.', 'In his decision, the trial justice addressed this issue, stating:', '“The [c]ourt has already noted that the defendant has', 'removed assets that are marital assets from the marital estate.', 'However, the [c]ourt, in fashioning a remedy, has available', 'sufficient assets to take care of this improper act on the part of the', 'defendant. Likewise, the plaintiff has removed some assets and', 'has also imposed an equity loan upon the former marital domicile.', 'The court will fashion an appropriate remedy so that both parties', 'will not be adversely affected by the activities that each took', 'unilaterally against the interests of the other.', '“The [c]ourt [o]rder of January 28, 2007 * * * is', 'particularly significant, wherein the defendant was ordered not to', 'pay child support from joint funds. ‘2. The payments to be made', 'by [defendant] to [plaintiff] shall not be paid out of the parties’', 'joint funds or those joint funds removed by [defendant] from the', 'parties’ joint accounts prior to or at the commencement of these', 'divorce proceedings, but shall be paid from defendant’s salary or', 'his own funds.’” The defendant admitted that, after discovering that plaintiff had withdrawn $6,000 (roughly sixty percent of the balance) from a marital account, he proceeded to withdraw a total of $74,694.96 from four marital accounts. In a court order dated June 27, 2007, defendant was ordered to “provide an accounting for the funds * * * he removed from the [p]arties[’] joint account in March 2007 and further, the [d]efendant shall forthwith return all said funds to a joint account. Neither [p]arty shall access the said funds without an [o]rder of this [c]ourt.” The defendant admitted that he never returned the funds, as ordered, and claimed that he spent the money on “marital bills and [his] attorney[’]s fees.”', 'The plaintiff argues that, as a result of defendant taking full control of the proceeds of the marital accounts, she was forced to use the marital line of credit to pay living expenses. We have no reason to believe that the trial justice overlooked any of the evidence of the parties’ conduct', '- 12 - regarding the marital assets. On the contrary, we are convinced that the trial justice considered all of the testimony and properly exercised his discretion in ordering a sixty/forty distribution of the $74,694.96 that defendant removed and retained for years, in contravention of a court order.', '3. Orion Account', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice overlooked the “uncontradicted and reliable evidence” that the Orion account was premarital property. Principally, defendant argues that because plaintiff listed the account as his premarital property in one of her exhibits, that exhibit constitutes an admission on her part that the account is his. The trial justice, however, on several occasions requested the parties to submit an exhibit that would establish the date that the Orion account was opened. In the absence of such evidence, it was not error for the trial justice to hold that the account was a marital asset, subject to equitable distribution.', '4. Household Furnishings', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred by awarding the household furnishings to plaintiff without including their value in the equitable distribution equation. The defendant mischaracterizes the trial justice’s ruling. The trial justice did not deny defendant a share in the household furnishings outright; rather, he ordered that “[i]f the parties have not divided the household furniture, furnishings and effects, formerly contained in the marital domicile, then all such items are awarded to the [p]laintiff.” 7 It is unclear from the record what effects, if any, defendant removed from the house prior to its sale. Again, it was not error for the trial justice to award to plaintiff whatever furnishings had not been divided. 7', 'It is worth noting that, at the time of the decision in August 2010, defendant had been out of the marital domicile for over three years, and the house had been sold the previous year.', '- 13 -', '5. Pawtucket Real Estate', 'In her cross-appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in failing to award her a share in the equity value of the house that defendant shared with his sister. The trial justice found that defendant held a sixty-percent interest in real estate located in the City of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He further found that this property had been transferred by defendant’s mother to defendant and his sister in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of $275,000 plus interest and that it was neither a gift nor an inheritance but was a marital asset subject to equitable distribution. The defendant’s mother testified that the note was enforceable by her estate; defendant testified that he had made no payments on the note. The trial justice awarded defendant his interest and liability in that property. The plaintiff argues that, because the property is part of the marital estate, she should receive sixty percent of the equity in the property. “[M]arital ‘[a]ssets are to be divided equitably, though not necessarily equally.’” Ruffel v. Ruffel, 900 A.2d 1178, 1193 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Perreault v. Perreault, 540 A.2d 27, 30 (R.I. 1988)). It is likely that there is very little equity in the Pawtucket property, 8 and it is subject to a $1-per-year lease to defendant’s mother. We are convinced that the trial justice appropriately considered all the relevant factors and properly exercised his discretion in awarding defendant his interest and liability in the property.', '6. Alimony Award and Pension Benefits', 'The one issue upon which both parties seem to agree, albeit for different reasons, is that the trial justice’s sua sponte modification of his written decision concerning the termination of alimony was inequitable. In the original decision, one of the conditions terminating defendant’s obligation to pay alimony was “[w]hen payments under all of the retirement plans (both Plaintiff 8', 'There was no testimony regarding the fair market value of the Pawtucket house.', '- 14 - and Defendant) commence.” The trial justice subsequently modified this provision such that alimony would terminate, inter alia, upon only defendant’s retirement. Exhibits introduced at trial indicate retirement accounts in defendant’s name, exclusive of his firefighters’ pension and accrued vacation time, in the amount of approximately $101,000, and accounts in plaintiff’s name in the amount of approximately $62,500.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred as a matter of equity by modifying his original decision because it effectively awards plaintiff lifetime alimony. He contends that because his salary less the $250 weekly alimony payments “is so much more” than the one-half of the pension benefit that he would receive upon retiring, he “will not be able to afford to retire.” Thus, he argues that equity compels that both parties’ “pensions be in place for alimony to terminate.”', 'The plaintiff finds inequity in the decision pending entry of final judgment for other reasons. She views defendant’s pension as a marital asset subject to equitable distribution, yet an asset over which defendant has been given full control concerning the timing of such distribution. The uncontroverted evidence at trial was that defendant would be eligible to receive his maximum retirement benefit of sixty percent after completing twenty-three years and four months of service, a milestone that he has likely since passed. It is clearly conceivable, however, that defendant, who is now fifty-four years old, could continue to work for some time. 9', 'The equitable distribution of a working spouse’s pension, or its value, can be a vexing problem under the best of circumstances. A trial justice must balance one spouse’s right to continue working against the other spouse’s desire, or need, for immediate access to his or her 9', 'At oral argument it was suggested that the mandatory retirement age for firefighters in the City of Pawtucket is sixty-five.', '- 15 - share of marital property. It is, however, a situation that we have had an opportunity to consider on several occasions.', 'The parties in Furia v. Furia came before this Court on two occasions; in Furia v. Furia, 638 A.2d 548, 553 (R.I. 1994) (Furia I), we held that the husband was entitled to collect his portion of the value of the wife’s pension benefit and that he need not wait until she retires to receive those benefits because “the employee/spouse should not unilaterally deprive the nonemployee/spouse of his or her property * * * .” In Furia v. Furia, 692 A.2d 327, 328 (R.I. 1997) (Furia II), after the Family Court ordered the wife to pay the husband one-half of the value of the pension, in the form of a lump sum of $30,000 with a promissory note for the remainder, we held that it was inequitable to require the wife to pay out the value of the pension before or at the time of her retirement; rather, we held that the proper distribution was a monthly payment from the wife to the husband equal to one-half of the pension benefits that she would have received had she retired.', 'In Janson v. Janson, 773 A.2d 901, 903 (R.I. 2001), we interpreted a property settlement agreement that was silent as to the date when the wife would be entitled to receive her share of the husband’s pension benefit. We held that, “in the absence of a clear agreement specifying how and when the husband’s pension was to be valued and distributed to the wife, * * * it was inequitable for the trial justice to allow the husband to ‘unilaterally deprive’ the wife of her share of the pension by delaying his retirement” until some uncertain future date. Id. at 904.', 'Likewise, in Hagopian v. Hagopian, 960 A.2d 250, 252 (R.I. 2008), the husband was a police officer who was eligible for retirement after twenty years of service and who faced mandatory retirement after twenty-five years of service. The trial justice in that case ordered the husband to make monthly payments to his wife equal to the value of her share of his pension,', '- 16 - commencing on the date when he became eligible to retire. Id. The wife would then receive the actual pension benefits when the husband actually retired. Id. In affirming this decision, we stated that “[t]he trial justice observed the demeanor of the parties from the bench and detected such a high level of hostility” that to allow the husband to unilaterally control the distribution date of his pension benefits would allow the possibility of “a grave injustice.” Id. at 253.', 'In the case under review, the trial justice initially conditioned the termination of alimony upon the eligibility of both parties to receive benefits under their retirement plans. He then explained his reasoning at the April 21, 2010 hearing on the motions for clarification, and he also exhorted the parties to negotiate a different resolution:', '“Now, the smartest thing, as I feel -- but this is not my decision --', 'for Mrs. Bober to do is to say, okay, if my husband retires, I want', 'my portion of the pension because that’s going to be more than the', 'alimony.

But if you make an', 'amendment to it, * * * then what happens is, she starts getting 50', 'percent of his pension and she doesn’t get alimony anymore, and', 'the 50 percent turns out to be more than the $250 a week alimony.', 'It’s kind of a simple solution, but that’s your decision to talk about.', '* * * But she continues to get alimony until all, hers and his,', 'pension plans are, according to this, commenced.', '“***', '“[M]y intent is clear, for the record, she’s not going to get ten cents', 'of his pension while she is getting $250 a week alimony.”', 'At the June 17, 2010 hearing, however, the trial justice modified the award, stating:', '“There is one substantive issue that if you can’t do it I’m going to', 'sua sponte do it because I think all I’ve done is create more', 'problems than the parties are entitled to, and that’s with respect to', 'the pensions.', '“***', '“I’m not changing anything about the 50/50.

As soon as Mr. retires or -- retires without waiting', 'for Mrs. to have her pension plans in a pay status, then she will', 'start getting his -- the 50 percent from his pension because it turns', 'out to be more than $250 a week alimony and alimony ends.”', 'In the context of this case, we are of the opinion that this aspect of the trial justice’s decision is inequitable, and we deem it to be error insofar as it misconceives the nature of defendant’s pension plan as a marital asset. Our case law makes clear that a pension is akin to a “forced savings account whose funds will become available to the parties upon retirement.” Moran v. Moran, 612 A.2d 26, 33 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Stevenson v. Stevenson, 511 A.2d 961, 965 (R.I. 1986)). Pension benefits are thus marital property subject to equitable distribution. Id. We have also said that “one spouse should not be allowed to defeat the other spouse’s interest in', '- 18 - an asset earned and accumulated during the marriage by invoking a condition wholly within his or her control.” Allard v. Allard, 708 A.2d 554, 558 (R.I. 1998).', 'In Furia II, 692 A.2d at 328, we opined that “the proper distribution of plaintiff’s pension is the payment each month by plaintiff to defendant of an amount equal to one-half of the monthly pension benefits that plaintiff would have received had she chosen to retire * * * .” In Janson, 773 A.2d at 904, we expanded upon that principle and held that “it was inequitable for the trial justice to allow the husband to ‘unilaterally deprive’ the wife of her share of the pension by delaying his retirement until some uncertain date in the future when he might decide to retire.”', 'Here, the trial justice seemingly recognized that plaintiff’s receipt of alimony in lieu of her interest in the firefighters’ pension was not in her best interest, yet he failed to articulate the potential option of requiring defendant to pay to plaintiff her share of the pension benefits, either at the time of the divorce or upon defendant attaining full eligibility. Pension benefits are not in the nature of support; rather, they are marital property in which plaintiff was awarded a fifty- percent interest.', 'We are mindful of the vast discretion with which a trial justice is imbued in equitably distributing marital assets. This was clearly a bitterly contested and acrimonious divorce. Sadly, we see such cases from time to time, and they are all too frequent occurrences in Family Court. We note the following comment by the no doubt exasperated trial justice during testimony concerning payment of tuition for the parties’ minor daughter:', '“You know, this case gets more disturbing every day. * * *', 'What troubles me is this case has been going on so long, how you', 'as attorneys and the parties did not split up at least a percentage of', 'these assets. * * * [I]f you don’t agree, I will make that decision,', 'but how do you keep all of this money tied up, the kid could go to', 'this school. No one is talking to each other. Obviously the', '- 19 -', 'lawyers aren’t talking to each other [either] because some of this', 'money would have gone for that child.” We commend the trial justice for his equanimity in presiding over, not only the lengthy trial, but also the plethora of pre- and posttrial motions.', 'One factor in the record, however, strikes us as unusual, disconcerting, and out of all proportion to the size of the marital estate or the complexities of the issues involved, and that is the enormity of the legal fees. We emphasize that the trial justice did not pass upon the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees; nor do we, other than to note that the record contains an attorney’s lien that was filed on September 3, 2010 in excess of $239,000.', 'As these parties have clearly exhausted their funds waging this “War of the Roses,” we shall not instruct the Family Court to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Rather, we invoke our own supervisory authority and direct that upon remand the Family Court enter an order directing defendant to pay to plaintiff one-half the value of his pension benefit at such time as he becomes eligible to receive his maximum pension benefit. 10 Such order shall be prospective from the date of this opinion, and not retroactive. Upon commencement of said payments, defendant’s obligation to pay alimony shall cease. We affirm the decision pending entry of final judgment in all other respects.', 'In light of our holding in this opinion, the defendant’s challenge to the award of alimony becomes moot. Finally, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of the plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees. In Family Court, “[a]n award of attorney’s fees is not punitive in nature but serves to ensure that a spouse who lacks financial stability is still able to secure competent representation in the divorce proceeding.” Thompson v. Thompson, 642 A.2d 1160, 1165 (R.I. 1994). We review a trial justice’s decision whether to award attorney’s fees under an abuse-of-discretion 10', 'We understand defendant’s maximum pension benefit to be sixty percent.', '- 20 - standard. See Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1193. In this case, it is difficult to discern how either party can bear the burden of the legal fees to which they have become exposed. In any event, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in declining to award attorney’s fees to the plaintiff.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Our review of the record reveals that the trial justice took great pains to consider all of the evidence before him. We have no doubt that the parties, given the opportunity, would continue to challenge aspects of the decision indefinitely (or at least until both they and the marital estate are exhausted); but, with deference to the trial justice’s discretion, and not a little admiration for his patience, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decree of the Family Court. The record shall be remanded to the Family Court. Upon remand, we direct the Family Court to enter an order directing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff one-half the value of his pension benefits at such time as he becomes eligible to receive his maximum pension benefits; such payments shall be made monthly. The defendant’s obligation to pay alimony shall cease upon the commencement of such payments. Upon the defendant’s retirement, the plaintiff shall receive one-half of the defendant’s pension benefits pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

When a medical imaging center in Woonsocket proved to be unsuccessful shortly after it opened, the resulting fallout spawned this suit, based on the lessor’s failure to make lease payments for the center’s medical equipment. The defendants and counterclaimants, Stonebridge Equipment Leasing, LLC, New England Radiology & Lab Services, P.C. (NERLS), Muhammad M. Itani, and Bisher I. Hashem, appeal from a final judgment entered by a justice of the Superior Court following the granting of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Siemens Financial Services, Inc. and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. 1 The trial justice found that summary judgment was appropriate in favor of the plaintiffs on both their claims as well as the defendants’ counterclaims. On appeal, the defendants contend that there are four material factual issues that should have precluded summary judgment. On April 8, 2014, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties 1', 'Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and Siemens Financial Services, Inc. are different entities. Where possible, we refer to them collectively as “Siemens” because the distinction between them does not change the analysis of the issues before us or the resolution of those issues.', '-1- to show cause why the issues in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2005, a group of physicians and businessmen, including Itani and Hashem, began working on an idea for a medical imaging center in Woonsocket. The group contacted Siemens about obtaining medical equipment and financing for the venture. According to defendants, in 2006, plaintiffs provided a business-plan template to Itani and his partners.', 'Siemens also provided defendants with a report entitled “A Demographic and Economic Profile of the Area Surrounding Woonsocket, RI” (the Demographic Profile). That report contained census data and forecasts for the potential demand for health-care services in Woonsocket and the surrounding area. Significantly, the Demographic Profile included a disclaimer on its inside cover that said that the information contained in the report was “based upon best available data but should not be taken as a prediction of the future,” and it further “encourage[d] the customer to seek independent verification[.]”', 'In 2007, plaintiffs agreed to lease medical diagnostic imaging equipment to defendants, including magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) machines, computerized-tomography (CT) machines, and radiography machines. 2 The defendants created two different entities to operate 2', '“MRI” is defined as “a noninvasive diagnostic procedure employing an MR scanner to obtain detailed sectional images of the internal structure of the body.” Random House Unabridged Dictionary 1259 (2d ed. 1993). A “CT scanner” or “CAT scanner” is defined as “a specialized x-ray instrument that displays computerized cross-sectional images of the body, providing a noninvasive means of visualizing the brain, lungs, liver, spleen, and other soft tissue.” Id. at 329.', '-2- the imaging center: one entity, Stonebridge, was to lease the equipment from Siemens and then sublease both the equipment and office space to another entity, NERLS, which in turn would operate the center. Stonebridge entered into a “Master Equipment Lease Agreement” and six leasing schedules with Siemens on March 29, 2007, and subsequently entered into a sublease agreement with NERLS.', 'As part of the transaction, Itani and Hashem executed personal guarantees in which they promised to satisfy any obligations that Stonebridge might fail to meet under the leases.', 'The imaging center opened in June 2007, but apparently it was spectacularly unsuccessful. As a result, NERLS made only one payment to Stonebridge under the terms of the sublease agreement. In November 2008, Stonebridge stopped making payments to Siemens. On December 16, 2008, plaintiffs notified defendants that they were in default of their obligations, and they demanded the return of all the leased equipment and payment of the stipulated loss value of the equipment, as defined in the leases, together with all past-due and unpaid lease payments and all other amounts due.', 'On March 23, 2009, plaintiffs filed a fourteen-count complaint in the Superior Court; the complaint included counts for replevin, breach of contract, breach of consent to sublease, and breach of sublease.', 'In their answers, defendants raised a variety of affirmative defenses, including plaintiffs’ alleged misrepresentation of “crucial financial and demographical information.” The defendants made counterclaims for intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, fraud and deceit, and a violation of Mass.

The court also dismissed defendants’ negligent- misrepresentation counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment on all the remaining claims and counterclaims, alleging that there were no facts in dispute that would support defendants’ defenses to the allegations raised in the complaint or their misrepresentation, fraud, or chapter 93A counterclaims.', 'On January 8, 2013, the trial justice heard arguments from the parties. In a written decision issued on February 15, 2013, he granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs on all claims and counterclaims. In so doing, the trial justice determined that there were “no genuine issues of material facts because nothing in the record supports the [d]efendants’ allegations of misrepresentations * * * or reasonable reliance thereon.” Regarding defendants’ counterclaim based on Mass.

Laws ch. 93A, the trial justice ruled that summary judgment was proper because defendants had merely cloaked their flawed misrepresentation claims in chapter 93A garments. 4 The defendants filed a timely appeal. 4', 'In his decision ruling on summary judgment, the trial justice also ruled that Massachusetts law controlled and that parts of the deposition testimony of Dr. Fathalla Mashali should be stricken. No party appealed the trial justice’s rulings regarding the stricken testimony or the applicable substantive law. Nonetheless, we do not perceive a conflict between the relevant substantive law of Massachusetts, where defendants contend the misrepresentations were made, Rhode Island, where the imaging center was located, and New Jersey, which was the applicable law according to plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion.', '-4-', 'On appeal, defendants present the same four factual disputes that they claim should have prevented summary judgment on either plaintiffs’ claims or defendants’ counterclaims. Those alleged disputes are that (1) plaintiffs provided defendants with more than just medical equipment and financing; (2) plaintiffs provided defendants with the Demographic Profile, upon which defendants relied to their detriment; (3) plaintiffs sold a $40,000 consulting program, known as the “Compass Program,” to defendants but never delivered the services that had been promised; and (4) plaintiffs provided business projections for the imaging center to defendants, upon which defendants detrimentally relied. 5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.

A party claiming intentional misrepresentation must show that the other party “made a false representation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity for the purpose of inducing the [claimant] to act thereon, and that the [claimant] reasonably relied upon the representation as true and acted upon it to his damage.” Russell v.

At the outset, we observe that the defenses and counterclaims raised by defendants did not include allegations that plaintiffs failed to deliver contracted-for services. Rather, defendants’ contentions were founded on plaintiffs’ purported misrepresentations of information such as the number of procedures the imaging facility would perform and the profit that it could be expected to earn. We thus find it difficult to perceive how a promise to provide certain services squares with the relevant allegations.', 'Moreover, even if defendants had averred that plaintiffs’ failure to fulfill these promises formed the basis of their defenses or counterclaims, defendants have failed to demonstrate that this creates a genuine issue of material fact. The evidence that plaintiffs submitted to support their motion for summary judgment included the deposition testimony of a former Siemens', '-7- salesman who worked on defendants’ account. During his deposition, the salesman testified that a presentation that he helped in making to defendants enumerated the types of services that plaintiffs could provide but not services that they had committed to provide in the context of the parties’ agreement. The defendants did not offer evidence to refute that testimony, nor did they otherwise demonstrate that Siemens had agreed to actually perform the services in question. In the same vein, defendants have not presented any evidence to show that plaintiffs’ description of available services was in any way inaccurate. Thus, the nature of the presentation by plaintiffs is undisputed.', 'The defendants further contend that plaintiffs’ failure to deliver the consulting service known as the “Compass Program” represents a genuine issue of material fact that should have precluded summary judgment. According to defendants, they made a $4,000 deposit towards the program but no service was rendered. It is undisputed that the $4,000 eventually was applied to defendants’ obligations under the lease. As with the purported factual dispute described above, however, any alleged failure by plaintiffs to fulfill their contractual obligations was not the basis of the defenses or counterclaims raised by defendants, which are in the nature of misrepresentation.', 'With respect to the assertions that actually were raised in the answers and counterclaims, defendants argue that the Demographic Profile provided to them by plaintiffs misrepresented the need for a medical imaging center in the Woonsocket area and that the figures included in a business plan misrepresented the likely success of the venture. Between them, the business plan and the Demographic Profile contained both factual information and projections, yet, in our opinion, defendants cannot show a genuine issue of material fact regarding the misrepresentation of either the facts or the forecasts.', '-8-', 'It appears to be well settled under Massachusetts law that “matter[s] of opinion, estimate, or judgment” cannot form the basis of a misrepresentation. Russell, 772 N.E.2d at 1066 (quoting Powell, 243 N.E.2d at 168); see also Stolzoff v. Waste Systems International, Inc., 792 N.E.2d 1031, 1041 (Mass.

Mason, 170 N.E.2d 718, 719-20 (Mass. 1960)). Thus, any forecasts of the future performance of the imaging center cannot form the basis of a misrepresentation claim or defense. Additionally, to the extent that the Demographic Profile also contained historical data, defendants have not offered any evidence disputing the data’s accuracy. See Russell, 772 N.E.2d at 1066 (explaining the need to show that a statement was false to prevail on a claim of misrepresentation).', 'Further, assuming that projections of the performance of the imaging center were the proper subject of a misrepresentation claim, the record does not support a conclusion that defendants relied on the numbers contained in the information provided to them.

In that case, a law student maintained that his school’s deans had misrepresented facts about the school’s accreditation prospects. Id. at 13-15. However, in granting summary judgment, that court reasoned that the student’s continued transfer attempts sabotaged his argument that he relied on the representations made by the deans. Id. at 16. The court said that the student’s attempt to explain “his failure to withdraw the [transfer] application[s]” by claiming that he relied on the deans’ statements was “merely a conclusory allegation insufficient to defeat summary judgment.” Id. The Rodi court also held that the reliance, if any, by the student was unreasonable as a matter of law, in part because of a disclaimer displayed in the school’s catalogue. Id. at 17-18.', 'Here, defendants are similarly positioned: they have not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding their asserted reliance on the projections by plaintiffs. Itani’s admissions that he doubted the accuracy of the numbers provided by Siemens and therefore reduced them by half rather than accepting them undermine his assertions that he relied on any representation by Siemens.', 'Moreover, the Demographic Profile’s inside cover features a disclaimer.', 'The disclaimer, in addition to noting that the “forecasts * * * should not be taken as a prediction of the future,” encouraged the customer “to seek independent verification of current or future demand for healthcare services.” In our opinion, defendants have not satisfied their burden of coming forward with a genuine dispute of fact about whether they relied on the projections.', '- 10 - Indeed, even if they had so relied, they have not shown a genuine issue as to the reasonableness of that reliance.', 'The defendants’ Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A counterclaims are coterminous with their fraud and misrepresentation claims; that is, the same factual allegations underlie all the counts. Thus, the flaws with the fraud and misrepresentation claims also prove fatal to the chapter 93A claim. See Rodi, 532 F.3d at 19 (affirming summary judgment on chapter 93A claims that were based on the same facts as fraudulent misrepresentation claims for which no reasonable reliance could be shown). To prevail under chapter 93A, the conduct at issue must “attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble world of commerce.” Eastern Motor Inns, Inc., 565 A.2d at 1274 (quoting Levings, 396 N.E.2d at 153). As described above, the alleged misrepresentations were either non-actionable projections, not shown to have been false, or not relied upon by defendants. We perceive no rascality or hijinks in the facts of this case that would entitle defendants to relief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.', 'We conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact. Thus, summary judgment was proper on both the plaintiffs’ claims and the defendants’ counterclaims.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

In this interpleader action filed by Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Association (RIJRA), Stanley Gurnick and Phoenix-Gurnick, RIGP (collectively, the Gurnicks) appeal from a grant of summary judgment by the Superior Court in favor of Navigant Credit Union (Navigant). The Superior Court decided that Navigant was entitled to insurance funds under an insurance policy on a parcel of property in North Providence, Rhode Island. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and we will proceed to decide the case at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The material facts in this case are largely undisputed. On June 8, 2006, Kevin O’Sullivan borrowed the sum of $221,000 from Patrick T. Conley and Gail C. Conley in order to purchase', '-1- four lots of land located on Pearl Avenue in North Providence. 1 O’Sullivan secured the note to the Conleys with a mortgage on the Pearl Avenue properties. 2 Thereafter, on June 1, 2009, the Conleys assigned the promissory note and mortgage for these properties to Stanley Gurnick (the first mortgage or the Gurnick mortgage).', 'On September 24, 2009, Navigant Credit Union (Navigant) entered into a “revolving credit loan” for $500,000 with Patriot Site of RI, Inc. (Patriot Site), an entity owned by O’Sullivan. O’Sullivan then granted a second mortgage to Navigant for the property located at 39 Pearl Avenue (being one of the lots which O’Sullivan had purchased from the Conleys) 3 in order to secure the loan to Patriot Site (the second mortgage or the Navigant mortgage). 4 The Navigant mortgage included a provision that required O’Sullivan to insure the mortgaged property against loss or damage to the buildings and other improvements to the land by fire or other risks of the kind commonly insured against “by prudent owners or lessees of buildings or improvements in the locality.” Pursuant to the insurance requirement in the Navigant mortgage, O’Sullivan obtained insurance for the property at 39 Pearl Avenue from RIJRA. The insurance policy listed O’Sullivan as the insured and Navigant as the mortgagee and loss payee. 1', 'The four lots of land purchased by O’Sullivan are listed as Lot Nos. 788, 789, 790, and 791 of Assessor’s Plat No. 5 in the North Providence land records. 2', 'This mortgage was duly recorded with the Town of North Providence Office of Land Evidence Records in Book 2276 at page 324. 3', 'The 39 Pearl Avenue property is Lot No. 788. The other three lots purchased by O’Sullivan are not directly involved in the instant action. Accordingly, any references to the property refer to the 39 Pearl Avenue property. 4', 'The Navigant mortgage was recorded with the Town of North Providence Office of Land Evidence Records in Book 2606 at page 234.', '-2-', 'Sometime in early 2010, the property at 39 Pearl Avenue sustained water damage that was insured by the RIJRA insurance policy. 5 RIJRA appraised the damage and determined that the covered loss to the property amounted to $79,336.83.', 'At some time thereafter, O’Sullivan defaulted on his promissory note to Gurnick. Consequently, Gurnick instituted foreclosure proceedings on the first mortgage.', 'Phoenix- Gurnick, RIGP (Phoenix-Gurnick), a partnership owned primarily by Stanley Gurnick and created for the purpose of taking possession of the mortgaged properties on Pearl Avenue, purchased the Pearl Avenue properties, including the property located at 39 Pearl Avenue, for the sum of $330,000 at the foreclosure sale on April 21, 2011.', 'On March 2, 2012, RIJRA filed the instant interpleader action in the Providence County Superior Court seeking a declaration as to which party was entitled to the insurance proceeds for the damage to the 39 Pearl Avenue property. 6 RIJRA deposited the total of $79,336.83 for the insurance proceeds into the Superior Court registry. The Gurnicks and Navigant filed cross- motions for summary judgment, each claiming that it was entitled to the insurance proceeds. The Gurnicks claimed that they owned the 39 Pearl Avenue property as a result of the foreclosure sale and that Navigant’s rights were extinguished upon that sale. Navigant asserted 5', 'The copy of the insurance policy in the record states that the policy was in effect from December 2010 through December 2011. However, the parties do not dispute that the insurance policy was in effect at the time the water damage occurred. 6', 'RIJRA named the following interested parties in 39 Pearl Avenue in its complaint: the Conleys, pursuant to a mortgage on the property; Navigant, also pursuant to a mortgage on the property; Stanley Gurnick, pursuant to a mortgage; Phoenix-Gurnick, pursuant to a mortgage; Monica Donovan, pursuant to a mortgage; Bryan Nordan and Darlene Jutras, pursuant to an execution levied by them on the property; and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM), pursuant to a notice of violation on the property. O’Sullivan and Monica Donovan were defaulted in this action for failure to file an answer. Bryan Nordan and Darlene Jutras did not contest the cross-motions for summary judgment or file a notice of appeal from the summary judgment which entered in regard to all parties in the case. RIDEM was voluntarily dismissed from the case in a stipulation filed with this Court on May 8, 2013.', '-3- that it was entitled to the insurance proceeds as the named mortgagee/loss payee in the insurance policy at issue.', 'The cross-motions for summary judgment came before the Superior Court for hearing on January 29, 2013. The hearing justice issued a bench decision on that day, holding that Navigant was entitled to the insurance proceeds because the funds were personal property under the insurance contract and Navigant had required O’Sullivan to name it as a loss payee under that contract. Consequently, the hearing justice granted Navigant’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Gurnicks’. Final judgment in favor of Navigant entered on February 21, 2013.', 'The Gurnicks timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.” In re Estate of Manchester, 66 A.3d 426, 430 (R.I. 2013). “We apply the same standards and rules as did the motion justice.” Beauregard v. Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 493 (R.I. 2013). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See id. “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Swain v.

Accordingly, we are satisfied that the hearing justice correctly concluded that the matter was ripe for summary judgment. The only issue on appeal for us to decide, therefore, is which party is entitled to the insurance proceeds as a matter of law.', 'On appeal, the Gurnicks contend that the hearing justice erred in holding that Navigant was entitled to the insurance proceeds because Navigant did not have title to the 39 Pearl Street property and because any interest that Navigant had in the property was ended at the foreclosure sale. The Gurnicks argue that, because they had title to the property pursuant to their first mortgage on it and then through the foreclosure sale, they are entitled to the insurance proceeds from the loss.', 'In contrast, Navigant asserts that insurance policies are contracts and that insurance is separate and distinct from the ownership of the insured property.', 'We agree with Navigant. This Court first stated more than a century and a half ago the general principle that “[a] mortgagee of property, real or personal, merely as such, has no interest in or claim to a policy of insurance effected by the mortgagor upon the property mortgaged for his own benefit.” Nichols v. Baxter, 5 R.I. 491, 493-94 (1858). More than a century later, we reaffirmed this general principle and held that “[a]n insurance contract or policy * * * pertains to the persons to the contract and not to the item insured. It is a personal contract which does not attach to or run with the property insured.”', 'Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Prudential Investment Corp., 101 R.I. 287, 292, 222 A.2d 571, 574 (1966). While we acknowledge that Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. involved insurance on personal property and not real property, we are of the opinion that this distinction is immaterial to the issue before us. See id. Accordingly,', '-5- we reiterate that insurance policies are to be treated as contracts. See Henderson v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 35 A.3d 902, 908 (R.I. 2012) (“An insurance policy is foremost ‘a contract between the insured and the insurer[.]’”) (quoting Employers’ Fire Insurance Co. v. Baker, 119 R.I. 734, 741, 383 A.2d 1005, 1008 (1978)). Here, the insurance contract was between RIJRA, O’Sullivan, and Navigant as the loss payee and mortgagee. The Gurnicks were not parties to it and did not become parties to the contract solely as a result of their holding the first mortgage on the property at the time the loss occurred or because they acquired title to the property at the foreclosure sale.', 'The Gurnicks argue that any insurable interest which Navigant had in the property was extinguished by the foreclosure sale. While we agree with the Gurnicks that the foreclosure sale may have extinguished the interest that Navigant possessed in the property, we find no error in the hearing justice’s conclusion that Navigant was, nonetheless, entitled to the insurance proceeds. It is a general principle of insurance law that an insurable interest is determined as of the date of the loss. See 44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance § 936 at 225 (2013) (stating that “[g]enerally, the extent of an insurable interest in property should be determined as of the date of the loss,” and noting, for example, that “[a] subsequent sale of the property on which the insured building had been located before it was destroyed by fire does not change the status of the property as of the date of the fire for insurance purposes”). There is no dispute that at the time the loss occurred—March of 2010—the foreclosure sale had not taken place and that Navigant still possessed a second mortgage on the property. We are satisfied that Navigant’s status as the second mortgagee on the property provided it with an insurable interest in the property at that time. See generally 3 Couch on Insurance 3d § 42:28 at 42-48 (3d Rev. ed. 2011) (stating that “[a] mortgagor and a mortgagee [of real property] each have an independent insurable interest in', '-6- the property”). Accordingly, because Navigant possessed an insurable interest in the property as of the date the loss occurred, we agree with the hearing justice and conclude that Navigant was entitled to the insurance proceeds.', 'The Gurnicks argue that, even though they were not named in the insurance policy as a loss payee, they should be granted an equitable lien on the proceeds from the policy by virtue of their mortgage on the property being superior to that of Navigant. They base their argument on Nichols, wherein this Court explained that “[a]n executory agreement by the mortgagor to insure for the benefit of the mortgagee, whether express or implied, gives to the latter an equitable lien upon the money due upon a policy taken out by the former upon the mortgaged premises * * *.” Nichols, 5 R.I. at 494. The Gurnicks urge us to follow the example of the bankruptcy court, that cited Nichols for the proposition that a court should “protect the mortgagee’s secured claim” and held that a mortgagee had an equitable lien on insurance proceeds even though the mortgagor had failed to name the mortgagee on the insurance policy. In re Natale, 174 B.R. 362, 364-65 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1994). We are of the opinion that the Gurnicks’ reliance on these cases is unavailing. Nichols emphasized the importance of “[a]n executory agreement by the mortgagor to insure for the benefit of the mortgagee.” See Nichols, 5. R.I. at 494. Similarly, in Natale, the mortgage agreement had expressly required the insured mortgagor to take out insurance on the property and name the mortgagee as loss payee.', 'See Natale, 174 B.R. at 364. No such requirement, expressed or implied, existed here.', 'In a final attempt to persuade us of the existence of such an agreement to insure, the Gurnicks, for the first time on appeal, refer to the statutory mortgage covenants, which were expressly incorporated into the first mortgage, to', '-7- argue that their first mortgage did, in fact, require O’Sullivan to insure the property. 7 This argument, however, was waived. As this Court has stated, “[a]lthough our review of [a motion for] summary judgment is de novo, it is not without limits” and “a party may not assert an argument on appeal that was not presented below.” See Konar v. PFL Life Insurance Co., 840 A.2d 1115, 1120 (R.I. 2004); see also Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 430 (R.I. 2013) (“It is axiomatic that this [C]ourt will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal that was not properly presented before the trial court.”) (quoting State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001)); cf. 36 C.J.S. Federal Courts § 460 at 465 (2003) (stating that “a party, on review, cannot assume an attitude inconsistent with, or different from, that taken by him or her at the trial”).', 'In any event, even if we were to consider the Gurnicks’ contention that the first mortgage required O’Sullivan to insure the property because of the statutory mortgage covenants set forth in G.L. 1956 § 34-11-20, this contention is incorrect as a matter of law. Section 34-11-20 sets out the meaning of the mortgage covenants and states, in pertinent part, that:', '“The mortgagor * * * covenants with the mortgagee * * * that', 'insurance against loss by fire shall be kept and maintained on the', 'buildings, if any, on the mortgaged premises in such office or', 'offices as the mortgagee or his or her heirs, executors,', 'administrators, or assigns shall approve, in a sum not less than the', 'amount secured by the mortgage deed, or as otherwise provided', 'herein, and that the policy or policies of such insurance shall be', 'delivered to and held by the mortgagee and assigned and', 'transferred, or made payable in case of loss, to the mortgagee or', 'his or her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, as collateral', 'security hereto * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Significantly, the mortgage covenants do not contain a requirement that the mortgaged property be insured against loss because of water damage, as occurred here. We further note that, at the 7', 'The Gurnicks conceded in the Superior Court that the first mortgage had not required O’Sullivan to insure the property.', '-8- time the first mortgage was conveyed, the property was undeveloped and there were no buildings on it to trigger application of the insurance provision in the statutory mortgage covenants. Consequently, we are constrained to conclude that the first mortgage did not include a requirement that the property be insured against the sort of damage that occurred here and that the Gurnicks are not entitled to an equitable lien on the insurance proceedings. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice correctly determined that Navigant was entitled to the insurance proceeds.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

In our opinion, under the situation presented in this case, he does not. The FAA engaged the defendant, Dr. Stuart Gitlow, to review the medical records of the plaintiff, Michael L. Woodruff, and to make a recommendation about the plaintiff’s fitness to have his medical certificate reinstated.', 'Woodruff had voluntarily surrendered his medical certificate to the FAA after a motor-vehicle accident that occurred in September 2008, and he sought reinstatement in 2009. Doctor Gitlow conducted his review of Woodruff’s medical records and concluded that Woodruff fell within the FAA’s regulatory definition for substance dependence. After the FAA denied the plaintiff’s application, Woodruff filed suit in Superior Court, alleging that Dr. Gitlow was negligent in making his report and that the FAA had relied on Dr. Gitlow’s conclusion to Woodruff’s detriment. A justice of the Superior Court denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, and Dr. Gitlow filed a petition for a writ of certiorari', '-1- with this Court, which we granted on September 10, 2012. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff has been a commercial pilot since 1988, working as a crop duster in Kansas and other states. In September 2008, Woodruff was involved in a motor-vehicle accident, after which he surrendered his second-class medical certificate at the request of the FAA. In addition to other requirements, the FAA requires that, to be eligible to pilot commercial aircraft, all pilots obtain and maintain a valid medical certificate.', 'See 14 C.F.R. § 61.3(c) (2014).', 'After recovering from the effects of the 2008 accident, Woodruff sought reinstatement from the FAA.', 'After he had reviewed Woodruff’s medical records, the FAA’s chief psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Chesanow, concluded that Woodruff met the FAA criteria for alcohol dependence, which would necessitate treatment and recovery to the satisfaction of the Federal Air Surgeon before Woodruff could receive the medical certificate. Doctor Chesanow requested that the FAA refer Woodruff’s medical records to Dr. Gitlow, a psychiatrist, to determine if he concurred with Dr. Chesanow’s opinion. As a result, the FAA retained defendant as a medical consultant to review certain medical documents and opine whether Woodruff met the FAA’s criteria for alcohol dependence.', 'In July 2009, the FAA provided Dr. Gitlow with portions of what were purported to be plaintiff’s hospital, medical, and driving records, along with FAA forms that had been filled out by Woodruff. When he was later deposed, Dr. Gitlow testified that the records that he had received were only a “fraction” of plaintiff’s entire file, that he did not physically examine Woodruff, and that he made his conclusions based solely on the documents that the FAA had', '-2- provided to him. 1 After reviewing the documents, Dr. Gitlow submitted his analysis to Dr. Chesanow on August 10, 2009. In it, Dr. Gitlow ultimately concurred that Woodruff was substance dependent as that condition is defined by the FAA regulations.', 'On November 24, 2010, plaintiff filed suit in Superior Court, alleging that Dr. Gitlow’s evaluation had been negligently performed and that his report caused the FAA to deny Woodruff’s application to renew his medical certificate. Woodruff further alleged that because he failed to regain his medical certificate, he was unable to resume working as a crop duster. On October 19, 2011, after both sides had engaged in discovery, Dr. Gitlow filed a motion for summary judgment in which he argued that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law for two reasons. First, Dr. Gitlow argued that he did not owe Woodruff a duty of care, and second, Dr. Gitlow maintained that he had immunity because his report was protected by this state’s Anti-SLAPP statute pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9- 33-1.', 'After hearing argument from the parties on January 3, 2012, a justice of the Superior Court denied Dr. Gitlow’s motion for summary judgment. The trial justice concluded that there was a material issue of fact “as to what Dr. Gitlow’s relationship, if any, was to the plaintiff in 1', 'The files Dr. Gitlow reviewed included a number of documents, some of which supported Dr. Gitlow’s ultimate conclusion, but also some that contained inaccuracies. For example, Dr. Gitlow reviewed an FAA form 8500-8, ironically prepared and signed by Woodruff, indicating that Woodruff had been arrested for driving under the influence in March 1988. The file also included a 2004 Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program (ADSAP) evaluation in which Woodruff indicated that he regularly consumed significant quantities of alcohol. On the other hand, in making his report, Dr. Gitlow relied upon infractions in the provided driving records that were alleged to be Woodruff’s, but were clearly those of an unrelated third party. Because the only question before this Court is whether Dr. Gitlow owed a duty of care to Woodruff, we need not address whether Dr. Gitlow was in any way negligent in the preparation of the report.', '-3- the context of this so-called records review.” 2 The trial justice conceded that the parties did not have a direct physician-patient relationship and that Dr. Gitlow had not physically examined Woodruff, but he nonetheless determined that there was authority under the Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 (1977) to conclude that a duty might arise in situations like the one present here. On February 23, 2012, Dr. Gitlow filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court, which we granted on September 10, 2012. In the order granting certiorari, we directed the parties to address whether, in this case, Dr. Gitlow, whom the FAA had hired to prepare a medical report, owed Woodruff a duty of care in the preparation of the report. 3', 'Before this Court, defendant presses three arguments. First, Dr. Gitlow argues that the trial justice erred when he held that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the parties’ relationship. Second, Dr. Gitlow maintains that he did not owe Woodruff a duty of care to accurately reach or report the conclusions of his records review. Finally, defendant asserts that his statements to the FAA are protected by the Anti-SLAPP statute. 2', 'We pause to note that in his amended complaint, Woodruff did not claim Dr. Gitlow had committed medical malpractice, but only that he had been negligent in compiling his report. Neither party has asserted that Dr. Gitlow had entered into a doctor-patient relationship with Woodruff. The existence of a doctor-patient relationship is a significant consideration in a medical-malpractice action, but is less relevant for a simple negligence claim. See Vigue v. John E. Fogarty Memorial Hospital, 481 A.2d 1, 6 (R.I. 1984) (discussing that at common law malpractice was consistently applied solely to the negligence of physicians and surgeons). 3', 'The order granting the petition for the writ of certiorari says:', '“The parties are directed to address in their Rule 12A', 'statements the issue, amongst others which the petitioner may', 'deem it appropriate to raise, of whether in the circumstances of this', 'case the petitioner, in preparing a medical report concerning the', 'respondent at the request of, and for presentation to, a federal', 'agency, owed the said respondent a duty of care in its preparation,', 'which duty, if not adhered to, could furnish the basis for the', 'imposition of liability for [the] petitioner’s alleged negligence.”', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of ‘the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” State v. Poulin, 66 A.3d 419, 423 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 489 (R.I. 2008)). “Questions of law * * * are not binding upon the [C]ourt and may be reviewed to determine what the law is and its applicability to the facts.” Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526, 530-31 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Shepard, 33 A.3d 158, 163 (R.I. 2011)).', 'We will reverse only when we find that the hearing justice committed an error of law. Id.', 'When we grant certiorari after a denial of a motion for summary judgment, “our review is governed by the same standard of review that applies to a grant of summary judgment.” Plunkett v. State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005) (citing McKinnon v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, 713 A.2d 245, 247 (R.I. 1998)). “It is well established that this Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the [trial] justice.’” Reynolds v. First NLC Financial Services, LLC, 81 A.3d 1111, 1115 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Inland American Retail Management LLC v. Cinemaworld of Florida, Inc., 68 A.3d 457, 461 (R.I. 2013)). Therefore, “if, ‘after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, [we conclude] that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be decided and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,’ we will affirm the judgment.” Id. (quoting Cinemaworld of Florida, Inc., 68 A.3d at 461).', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Genuine Issues of Material Fact', 'Before this Court, Dr. Gitlow first argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he found that the extent of the relationship between Woodruff and Dr. Gitlow was a genuine issue of material fact and that, as a result, he was precluded from granting the motion for summary judgment. Doctor Gitlow contends that the facts of the case are not in dispute: the FAA retained Dr. Gitlow to review certain medical records and render an opinion as to whether Woodruff was chemically dependent; Dr. Gitlow based his opinion solely on the records the FAA presented to him; and Dr. Gitlow never physically examined Woodruff or had any contact with him whatsoever. Neither before this Court, nor in the Superior Court has Woodruff offered competent evidence to dispute Dr. Gitlow’s statements of fact or even disagree with Dr. Gitlow’s version of the facts. Generally, if the nonmoving party does not dispute the facts, we will determine if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Boucher v. McGovern, 639 A.2d 1369, 1374 (R.I. 1994).', 'However, in this case, the trial justice determined that there was an issue of material fact surrounding whether a physician-patient relationship existed between the parties. “Rule 56(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a trial justice to grant a motion for summary judgment when no genuine issue of material fact to be resolved exists.” Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank v. Dudley Service Corp., 605 A.2d 1325, 1328 (R.I. 1992). The trial justice makes this determination after he reviews “the affidavits, pleadings, and other relevant documents in the case in the light most favorable to the opposing party.” Id. Because', '-6- our standard of review is de novo, we also may scrutinize the record to determine the existence of genuine issues of material fact, and if we find none, we may reverse the trial justice’s denial of the motion for summary judgment. Id.', 'Whether the establishment of a physician-patient relationship is a question of fact to be determined by the jury or a matter of law to be determined by the court is an issue of first impression for the Court. Our review of the approach taken by other jurisdictions reveals that the majority of jurisdictions have held that in medical malpractice and negligence cases, the existence of a physician-patient relationship is a question of fact for the jury. See Wolf v. Fauquier County Board of Supervisors, 555 F.3d 311, 320 (4th Cir. 2009) (holding, under Virginia law, that the existence of a physician-patient relationship is a question of fact); Garcia v. City of Boston, 115 F. Supp. 2d 74, 78 (D. Mass. 2000) (holding, under Massachusetts law, that the existence of a relationship is a question of fact), aff’d, 253 F.3d 147 (1st Cir. 2001); Nold ex rel. Nold v. Binyon, 31 P.3d 274, 288 (Kan. 2001) (holding that the existence of a relationship is for a jury to decide). But see Dixon v. Siwy, 661 N.E.2d 600, 607 (Ind. Ct. App. 1996) (holding that the existence of a relationship is a legal question for the court to decide).', 'We need not reach that question, however, to decide this case. Generally, summary judgment is inappropriate for negligence claims as they “should be resolved by trial in the ordinary manner.” DeMaio v. Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 130 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Gliottone v. Ethier, 870 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2005)). This is “because of the peculiarly elusive nature of the concept of negligence.” Gliottone, 870 A.2d at 1028 (quoting Bland v. Norfolk and Southern Railroad Co., 406 F.2d 863, 866 (4th Cir. 1969)). Even if we were to conclude that this determination is a question for the jury, it is well settled that the trial justice may resolve the issue as a matter of law “if the facts suggest only one reasonable inference.” Berard v. HCP,', '-7- Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1218 (R.I. 2013) (quoting DeMaio, 59 A.3d at 130). This viewpoint comports with the approach of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on a motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case. Jennings v. Badgett, 230 P.3d 861 (Okla. 2010). In that case, the court ruled that the existence of a physician-patient relationship is a question of fact; however, “[o]n a motion for summary judgment when the material facts are undisputed and the evidentiary materials and facts show one party is entitled to judgment, the court may decide the issue as a matter of law.” Id. at 867. We disagree with the trial justice that there was a genuine issue of material fact and are of the opinion that the undisputed facts lead to only one reasonable conclusion. We conclude, as a matter of law, that the record does not establish a traditional physician-patient relationship. However, this conclusion does not end our inquiry because Dr. Gitlow, even in the absence of a traditional physician-patient relationship, may have nonetheless owed Woodruff a duty of reasonable care.', 'B', 'Was There a Duty?', 'Doctor Gitlow next argues that he did not owe any duty of care to Woodruff because, as a physician retained by a third party to review records and render an opinion, he was not liable for any alleged lack of care in the conclusions he reported. To succeed on a negligence claim, “a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.” Wyso v. Full Moon Tide, LLC, 78 A.3d 747, 750 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 129 (R.I. 2008)). Although generally it may be inappropriate to dispose of a negligence claim on summary judgment grounds, a court may resolve the duty element without a trier of fact because “the existence of a duty is nonetheless a question of law.” Id. (citing Ouch', '-8- v. Khea, 963 A.2d 630, 633 (R.I. 2009)). “In the absence of such a duty, ‘the trier of fact has nothing to consider and a motion for summary judgment must be granted.’” Id. (quoting Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009)). We have not previously considered the duty, if any, that a doctor would owe to a patient when the doctor has been hired by a third party to provide an opinion about the patient based solely on the review of the patient’s records. In their papers to this Court, both parties point to several other jurisdictions that have addressed similar questions.', '1', 'Jurisdictional Perlustration', 'First, the majority of courts, primarily in cases sounding in medical malpractice, have held that doctors who have been engaged to perform an independent medical examination do not owe a duty of care to the patient because there is no physician-patient relationship. See, e.g., Smith v. Radecki, 238 P.3d 111, 115 & n.13 (Alaska 2010) (concluding, after a review of other state analyses, that there was no physician-patient relationship and thus no duty of care); Martinez v. Lewis, 969 P.2d 213, 218-19 (Colo. 1998) (en banc) (holding that an independent evaluation did not give rise to a doctor-patient relationship and therefore no duty was owed); Erpelding v. Lisek, 71 P.3d 754, 760 (Wyo. 2003) (noting that the court’s conclusion of no duty is in accord with nearly every other jurisdiction that has reached the issue). Second, and more importantly for our purposes, in two circumstances, after concluding that no professional relationship existed between the examiner and examinee, some courts have found that there is a limited duty under common-law negligence. Those courts have reasoned that even when hired to conduct an independent evaluation, under common-law negligence principles, a doctor would still owe a duty to avoid causing harm to a patient. See Harris v. Kreutzer, 624 S.E.2d 24, 31', ""-9- (Va. 2006); see also Dyer v. Trachtman, 679 N.W.2d 311, 314-17 (Mich. 2004) (finding, after a thorough review of the approach in other states, a limited duty to not cause harm to the patient). In Peace v. Weisman, 368 S.E.2d 319 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988), the Department of Resources hired a physician to determine the plaintiff's fitness to return to work. In denying the patient’s medical malpractice claim, the court held as a matter of law that the parties did not establish a physician- patient relationship and that the doctor’s only duty to the patient under a theory of negligence “was to conduct the examination in such a manner as not to injure him.” Id. at 321."", 'Furthermore, a smaller number of courts have found that an independent medical examiner (IME) has a duty of reasonable care to diagnose serious or life-threatening medical conditions and to disclose such discovered conditions directly to the examinee. See, e.g., Daly v. United States, 946 F.2d 1467, 1470 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding, under Washington law, that even in the absence a doctor-patient relationship, a physician who conducted a pre-employment physical owed a duty to inform the examinee of identified abnormalities); Green v. Walker, 910 F.2d 291, 296 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding, under Louisiana law, that a pre-employment examination creates a limited doctor-patient relationship, obligating the doctor to inform the patient of any test results that pose an imminent danger to the patient’s physical or mental well-being); Stanley v. McCarver, 92 P.3d 849, 853 (Ariz. 2004) (en banc) (finding a limited duty of reasonable care for a physician, despite the existence of no formal relationship to the patient, to diagnose serious or life-threatening conditions).', 'A striking difference, however, between those cases and the one before us on appeal is that Dr. Gitlow never examined Woodruff but merely reviewed the records provided to him by the FAA. In fact, our research has revealed only one case that bears even some resemblance to the one before us. In Rand v. Miller, 408 S.E.2d 655, 656 (W. Va. 1991), the Supreme Court of', '- 10 - West Virginia addressed liability in a medical-malpractice action when the physician was hired by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to review the medical records of a prospective employee and rendered an inaccurate report, resulting in the USPS not hiring the applicant. The court declined to answer “the question of whether a physician hired by an employer to examine an employee is totally immune from a malpractice action brought by the employee,” but did note that any relationship between the employee and the doctor is even more tenuous when there is no physical examination. Id. at 658. Because the applicant filed a medical-malpractice claim, however, the court’s analysis centered on the existence of a doctor-patient relationship, which is irrelevant to our consideration. Id. at 656-57. 4', 'Here, both parties characterize Dr. Gitlow’s actions as those of an IME even though no physical examination occurred.', 'Generally, when our jurisprudence has employed the term “independent” or “impartial medical examiner,” the cases have involved court-appointed IMEs under our workers’ compensation statutes. See Poudrier v. Brown University, 763 A.2d 632, 634 (R.I. 2000); see also Zecchino v. State, 520 A.2d 139, 140 (R.I. 1987) (discussing the employee’s election to have an impartial medical examiner appear before a workers’ compensation committee for purposes of cross-examination). In all our cases involving the use of an IME, the examinee has submitted to a physical examination. In contrast, Woodruff predicates his claims on the purported negligence of Dr. Gitlow during his review of the FAA- provided files.', 'Recognizing that he urges us to adopt what is a decidedly minority position, Woodruff argues that this Court should embrace the position taken by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in Reed v. Bojarski, 764 A.2d 433, 441 (N.J. 2001). We decline to do so. In Reed, 764 A.2d at 4', 'The complaint in this case is cast as one of simple negligence, not medical malpractice.', '- 11 - 434-35, a physician, Bojarski, was hired by a third party to administer a pre-employment physical examination to Reed. During the examination, the physician became aware that the plaintiff had signs of lymphoma, but he did not convey that information to the employer, who had ordered the exam. Id. at 435. Seven months later, an X-ray showed a large mass in the plaintiff’s mediastinum, and he was diagnosed with late-stage Hodgkins disease. 5 Id. The plaintiff passed away eight months later at the age of twenty-eight. Id. Woodruff contends that the court in Reed held that an IME has a duty to perform professionally reasonable and competent examinations or diagnoses. But our review of Reed points to a more narrowly channeled duty.', 'The court based its decision on the state board of medical examiners’ regulations which impose a duty that “includes and encompasses an affirmative obligation of disclosure in those circumstances where potentially life-threatening abnormalities or conditions are discovered during the course of examination.” Reed, 764 A.2d at 444. The court concluded that the IME owed the examinee a duty of care “to the extent of the examination and in communicating its outcome.” Id. at 445. There can be no dispute that the facts of the case at bar do not remotely fall within the scope of this duty.', 'Doctor Gitlow conducted no physical examination, did not discover a life-threatening ailment, nor did he fail to disclose any such condition to the FAA. We question whether Woodruff’s claims would be colorable even in New Jersey.', 'Our research reveals that very few courts have addressed physicians who, as here, have merely reviewed files.', 'These infrequent cases are rooted in determinations of whether an 5', '“The mediastinum is that space lying within the chest. It is bounded on each side by the lung cavities. Within the mediastinum are found the heart, esophagus, the aorta[,] and vena cava.” Wilkinson v. Vesey, 110 R.I. 606, 611 n.3, 295 A.2d 676, 681 n.3 (1972).', '- 12 - agency’s denial of benefits, based on a file review, was arbitrary and capricious or whether the subsequent report filed by a file-only physician review is medically reliable. See Calvert v. Firstar Finance, Inc., 409 F.3d 286, 295 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that a file review is not “inherently objectionable,” but “may * * * raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination”); Gannon v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 360 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir. 2004) (deciding that a nonexamining physician’s review of a claimant’s files was nonetheless medically reliable evidence). There appears to be little support in other jurisdictions to which we can look for guidance on this matter.', '2', 'The Restatement (Second) Torts', 'During the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the trial justice said that there was authority in the Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 for the proposition that a duty arises in this type of situation.', 'Section 552 is entitled “Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others.” It says:', '“(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or', 'employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a', 'pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of', 'others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for', 'pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the', 'information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence', 'in obtaining or communicating the information.” Id. at 126-27. Significantly, liability is limited “to loss suffered * * * by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information.” In this case, the person or group that engaged Dr. Gitlow and that was intended to benefit from his report was the FAA and not Woodruff. The FAA retained Dr. Gitlow, and there is neither evidence nor a claim that the FAA suffered a loss because of anything he may have done or failed to do.', '- 13 - Section 552(2)(b) of the restatement also limits liability to loss suffered “through reliance upon [the information] that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends * * * .” The record simply does not support an assertion that Woodruff relied upon Dr. Gitlow’s report and suffered a loss due to that reliance. In our opinion, the trial justice’s use of § 552 of the restatement to discern a duty in this case was misplaced. 6', '3', 'The Ad Hoc Approach', 'Because our review of other jurisdictions has not provided direction in resolving this case, we will use our familiar ad hoc approach to decide whether Dr. Gitlow owed a duty to Woodruff. We determine whether a duty exists by “employ[ing] an ad hoc approach that ‘turns on the particular facts and circumstances of a given case.’” Ouch, 963 A.2d at 633 (quoting Benaski v. Weinberg, 899 A.2d 499, 502 (R.I. 2006)).', 'We consider “all relevant factors, including the relationship of the parties, the scope and burden of the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, public policy considerations, and notions of fairness.” Gushlaw v. Milner, 42 A.3d 1245, 1252 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Volpe v. Gallagher, 821 A.2d 699, 705 (R.I. 2003)). Although “[n]o clear-cut rule exists to determine whether a duty is in fact present in a particular case,” we have outlined five factors that should be considered when determining the presence of a duty. Banks v. Bowen’s Landing Corp., 522 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 1987). Those factors are:', '“(1) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (2) the degree of', 'certainty that the plaintiff suffered an injury, (3) the closeness of', 'connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury', 'suffered, (4) the policy of preventing future harm, and (5) the', 'extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the', 'community for imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting 6', 'In his papers with this Court, Woodruff did not address the applicability of Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 (1977). Also, it is worth noting that this Court has not adopted § 552.', '- 14 -', 'liability for breach.” Bucki v. Hawkins, 914 A.2d 491, 495-96', '(R.I. 2007) (quoting Banks, 522 A.2d at 1225).', 'In considering the Banks factors we have limited the applicability of the finding of a duty to a particular appeal because the factors are “case specific and should not be taken or construed to limit the scope of factors that we shall consider in future cases involving different factual situations.” Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 685 n.2 (R.I. 1994).', 'There is no question that the parties did not have a doctor-patient relationship in the traditional sense; however, Woodruff urges this Court to nonetheless find that an independently hired physician owes a duty to the examinee to render a professionally reasonable and competent evaluation of his medical records. Applying Banks to the case before us, upon initial review, the first three factors appear to tip in Woodruff’s favor.', 'With respect to the first two, the foreseeability of harm and the degree of certainty that Woodruff suffered an injury, a finding by Dr. Gitlow of alcohol dependence would foreseeably cause Woodruff economic harm to a high degree of certainty. Also, the third factor, discussing the closeness of connection between Dr. Gitlow’s conduct and the injury suffered, appears to favor Woodruff because he argues that Dr. Gitlow’s report was the sole determination that resulted in the FAA denying his medical certificate. 7', 'However, with a more discriminating eye, these considerations are resolved ultimately for Dr. Gitlow. Keeping in mind that we construe all facts in favor of the nonmoving party, whether Dr. Gitlow was or was not negligent does not implicate foreseeability because Woodruff was harmed by the conclusion that he was alcohol dependent, not by the means undertaken by Dr. Gitlow in reaching that conclusion. This is unlike the situation in Daly, 946 F.2d at 1468, 7', 'For the purposes of this appeal, we accept this assertion; however, our review of the record reveals no support for it.', '- 15 - where a doctor’s failure to disclose the existence of lung disease resulted in the patient learning about the disease only after it had reached the stage where it was incurable. The allegation in that case was that had the doctor acted competently, the patient would have learned of his condition while it remained treatable. Here, however, either a competent or negligent evaluation could have resulted in a finding of alcohol dependence, the determination of which caused the harm suffered. Also, it would appear that the initial conclusion of Dr. Chesanow, the FAA’s chief psychiatrist, that Woodruff was alcohol dependent dampens the foreseeability of harm and militates against the degree of closeness to defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered. The FAA’s chief psychiatrist, having made his own evaluation, essentially asked Dr. Gitlow for a second opinion, which seems to untether the connection between Dr. Gitlow’s conduct and the injury.', 'In our opinion, the fourth and fifth factors weigh heavily in Dr. Gitlow’s favor. With respect to the fourth factor, the policy of preventing future harm, it is our opinion that imposing the duty sought by Woodruff would do little to prevent future harm because the harm Woodruff suffered arose from the conclusion that he was alcohol dependent; a conclusion that the FAA had already reached. The harm suffered by Woodruff was the alcohol-dependence outcome, not the process, whether performed negligently or competently by Dr. Gitlow. Also, the availability of alternate remedial avenues incentivizes state and federal agencies to hire independent medical evaluators who will perform their duties competently.

The applicant, Amadeu Santos, appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. Santos contends that the hearing justice erred in finding that his application was barred by the doctrine of laches. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On August 1, 1996, Amadeu Santos was charged by indictment with three counts of second-degree sexual assault by force or coercion against two women, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4 and § 11-37-5. After initially pleading not guilty to these three counts, Santos made a request to enter a plea of nolo contendere under the dictates of North Carolina v. Alford, 400', '-1- U.S. 25 (1970). 1 A plea hearing was held on March 16, 1998, during which the hearing justice accepted Santos’s plea and sentenced him to a suspended sentence of five years with five years probation. As conditions of his probation, Santos was required to register as a sex offender, to receive counseling, and to refrain from having contact with the two victims. Santos completed his probation and complied with the sex-offender registration requirements. He is no longer required to register in Rhode Island as a sex offender; however, Santos asserts that if he moves to another state, he will be required to register as a sex offender in that state.', 'On June 22, 2012, more than fourteen years after his plea hearing, Santos filed a verified application for postconviction relief pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1. Santos asserted that the March 16, 1998 plea colloquy did not comply with Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2 Specifically, Santos contended that his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because the court’s colloquy “failed to contain sufficient factual evidence to prove the three charges against him.” Santos further asserted that he was not made aware that “sexual contact,” which is an element of second-degree sexual assault, entailed the touching of a 1', 'Pursuant to North Carolina v.

In response, Santos argued that the state could not prove that he was aware of the insufficiency of his plea until he conferred with new counsel shortly before filing his application for postconviction relief. 4 On November 7, 2012, a hearing was held on Santos’s application for postconviction relief as well as on the issues raised in the state’s motion to dismiss. The state introduced as a stipulated exhibit the affidavit of Attorney William Devine, who represented Santos at the time of his plea in 1998. In this affidavit, Attorney Devine stated that he had “no independent recollection of [his] representation of Amadeu Santos.” Attorney Devine further stated that he “[did] not remember specifically whether or not [he] reviewed the elements of second degree sexual assault with [] Amadeu Santos before he changed his plea,” but he added that “it is [his] practice with any change of plea in a criminal matter to review the elements of the crime charged with [his] client.” Attorney Devine asserted that he did “not possess any files or documents pertaining to this matter.”', 'On December 10, 2012, the hearing justice issued a written decision denying Santos’s application for postconviction relief.

Thus, the only issue currently before this Court for review is whether the hearing justice erred in finding that the delay was unreasonable.

The state asserts that the delay was unreasonable because', '-5- Santos should have been aware of the basis for his postconviction-relief claim at the time of his plea. According to the state, the fact that Santos did not file his application for postconviction relief until he was faced with a potential sex-offender registration requirement in another state shows that he was merely “disgruntled about the collateral consequences of his conviction” rather than “confused about the nature of the offense to which he pled.” Furthermore, the state contends that Santos had access to a privately retained attorney in 2002; if he had been confused about the validity of his plea, he could have asked that attorney, rather than wait until 2011, when he retained the attorney who filed the instant application for postconviction relief.', 'Santos, on the other hand, argues on appeal that the state failed to prove that he negligently failed to assert a known right.', 'Santos asserts that he was unaware until his consultation with new counsel in 2011 that the “sexual contact” element of second-degree sexual assault is defined as a touching for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. 6 Santos further contends that “the charging document and the prosecutor’s representation at the plea hearing used only the term ‘sexual contact,’ which was not sufficient to put Mr. Santos on notice of the intent requirement of the offense charged.” Thus, Santos explains that he did not become “aware 6', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4, second-degree sexual assault is defined as follows:', '“A person is guilty of a second degree sexual assault if he or she', 'engages in sexual contact with another person and if any of the', 'following circumstances exist:', '“(1) The accused knows or has reason to know that the', 'victim is mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled or', 'physically helpless.', '“(2) The accused uses force or coercion.', '“(3) The accused engages in the medical treatment or', 'examination of the victim for the purpose of sexual arousal,', 'gratification or stimulation.” “Sexual contact” is defined as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37- 1(7).', '-6- of his own unawareness” regarding the nature of the charged offenses until he consulted with new counsel. According to Santos, the hearing justice misconceived the nature of his claim by assuming that he was aware of his confusion at the time of the plea.', 'At the hearing, Santos conceded that the court could consider the reasonableness of the delay in light of the nature of the allegations made in the application, but argued that the state presented no evidence that he was aware of a legal remedy. Santos’s counsel later emphasized this point when responding to the hearing justice’s question, “Was [Santos] aware of the facts or was he aware of the remedy[?] You’ve argued both.” Santos’s counsel said, “That’s correct, but really, it’s the remedy, Judge. Was he aware that he had a remedy to reopen this matter back in 199[8], at the moment he was aggrieved[?]” The following exchange further clarifies the nub of Santos’s argument:', '“The COURT: But you’re saying that it’s Mr. Santos’[s]', 'state of mind and his knowledge or lack of knowledge of what', 'remedy might be available to him based on the facts he brings to', 'the Court’s attention today --', '“[Defense Counsel]: Certainly -- I’m sorry.', '“The COURT: -- that controls the question of the', 'reasonableness of his delay.', '“[Defense Counsel]: What I’m saying, Judge, is that laches', 'is their burden.

Downcity Capital Partners, Ltd., 973 A.2d 40, 45 (R.I. 2009) (“where the facts suggest only one reasonable inference, the trial justice may properly treat the question as a matter of law” and grant summary judgment) (quoting Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc., 119 R.I. 70, 77, 376 A.2d 329, 333 (1977)). Here, the circumstances of Santos’s case are that he waited fourteen years to file his application and that, during that time, he had repeated contact with the judicial system in the form of fulfilling his obligations to register as a sex offender, appearing before the court in relation to his probation requirements, and making two motions for permission to travel, for which he retained private counsel.', 'The hearing justice found that the state met its burden of proving that Santos’s delay was unreasonable. He stated: “The [c]ourt believes that the ground asserted for post-conviction relief was known, or should have been known, to [applicant] well earlier than fourteen years after the plea. Thus, the [c]ourt finds that the [s]tate has met its burden of proving the delay to have been unreasonable.” It is a well-established principle that this Court gives great deference to a hearing justice’s factual findings. Otero v. State, 996 A.2d 667, 670 (R.I. 2010).

Rosano, appeals from a final judgment dismissing his complaint against the defendants Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), EquiFirst Corporation (EquiFirst), and Sutton Funding LLC c/o HomEq Servicing (Sutton Funding) (collectively defendants). The plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief preventing the foreclosure sale of his mortgaged property, arguing that the assignment of his mortgage through MERS was a legal nullity. On appeal, the plaintiff asks us to address anew the question of whether a nominee of a mortgage lender, holding legal title to the mortgage but not holding the correlative promissory note, may exercise the statutory power of sale and foreclose on the mortgaged property. The defendants assert that the action is controlled by our recent precedent and that the dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint was appropriate under Rule 12(b)(6) and (7) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we', '-1- conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On June 25, 2007, Rosano executed an adjustable-rate promissory note in favor of EquiFirst in the amount of $379,000, secured by a mortgage on real estate located at 331 High Street in the Town of Bristol (the property). The mortgage designates EquiFirst as the Lender and names MERS as the mortgagee and the Lender’s nominee. 1', 'The mortgage document provides, in relevant part, that “Borrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS, (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS, with Mortgage Covenants upon the Statutory Condition and with the Statutory Power of Sale * * * .” The mortgage document also provides that “if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property * * * .” 1', 'It may be useful at this point to restate our description of MERS and its role in the mortgage industry. In 1993, several major participants in the lending community created a national electronic registration database to track transfers of ownership interests in mortgaged properties; the system created is MERS. Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1072 (R.I. 2013). MERS operates to streamline the process of rapid home-loan transfers and to minimize recording errors. Id. at 1073. In MERS transactions, a member of MERSCORP, Inc. (MERSCORP), the parent corporation owning MERS, extends a loan. Id. The lending member is designated on the promissory note as the lender; MERS is named in the mortgage as the mortgagee and acts as nominee for the lender, as well as any successors and assigns of the lender. Id. Therefore, whenever there is a transfer of a note between MERSCORP members, there is no need to record an assignment of the mortgage, as MERS remains the mortgagee of record and may act as nominee for all MERSCORP members. Id. When the transfer is from a MERSCORP member to a nonmember, an assignment from MERS to the nonmember is required. Id.', '-2-', 'On September 4, 2009, MERS, as EquiFirst’s nominee, assigned the mortgage to Sutton Funding, recording the assignment in the land evidence records of the Town of Bristol. Shortly thereafter, in November 2009, the mortgage was assigned again, this time from Sutton Funding to Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company (Bank of New York); the assignment was again recorded in the land evidence records of Bristol. Bank of New York then sent a notice of default for nonpayment to Rosano. 2 After Rosano failed to act to remedy his default, Bank of New York published a notice of sale in The Providence Journal for four weeks and initiated a foreclosure sale. The foreclosure sale occurred on January 6, 2010, with Bank of New York prevailing as the highest bidder and recording a foreclosure deed the next month, on February 9, 2010.', 'On January 15, 2010, before Bank of New York recorded the foreclosure deed, plaintiff filed suit in Superior Court challenging the validity of the two assignments of the mortgage, as well as the foreclosure sale of the property. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and (7).', 'In deciding the motion to dismiss, the hearing justice determined that plaintiff’s allegations with respect to the invalidity of the mortgage assignment were merely conclusory statements and that plaintiff had failed to plead facts that “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Accordingly, he dismissed plaintiff’s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6). The hearing justice also held that the assignments from MERS to Sutton Funding and from Sutton Funding to Bank of New York were both valid. He further concluded that Bank of New York lawfully commenced foreclosure proceedings and that, as the successful bidder, it now holds valid title to the property. 2', 'Although plaintiff argues in his Rule 12A statement that Bank of New York lacked authority to send a notice of default, he does not contend anywhere in his submission that he was not in default.', '-3-', 'Additionally, the hearing justice dismissed plaintiff’s complaint under Rule 12(b)(7) for failing to join an indispensable party, i.e., Bank of New York. The hearing justice found that the interests of Bank of New York as the current title holder of the recorded deed in question were inextricably tied to the adjudication of the issues presented by plaintiff’s complaint, which specifically sought nullification of the foreclosure sale and return of title to plaintiff. The hearing justice therefore held that Bank of New York was an indispensable party to the action brought by plaintiff and, accordingly, he dismissed the complaint.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Because the hearing justice predicated the judgment dismissing plaintiff’s complaint on the alternate grounds of Rule 12(b)(6) and (7), we need affirm on only one such ground to dispose of the issues raised in this appeal.

Section 9-30-11 provides in part: “When declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.” As we recently emphasized in Burns v. Moorland Farm Condominium Association, 86 A.3d 354, 358 (R.I. 2014), the command of § 9-30-11 is mandatory. “[O]rdinarily failure to join all persons who have an interest that would be affected by the declaration is fatal.” Burns, 86 A.3d at 358 (quoting Abbatematteo v.

Moreover, Rule 19(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure is abundantly clear in its requirements for joining indispensable parties, stating that:', '“A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the', 'action if (1) in the person’s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among', 'those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of', 'the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person’s', 'absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person’s ability to', 'protect that interest * * * .” (Emphasis added.)', 'This Court has defined “an indispensable party as one ‘whose interests could not be excluded from the terms or consequences of the judgment * * * as where the interests of the absent party are inextricably tied in to the cause * * * or where the relief really is sought against the absent party alone.’” Root v.

It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which the complete relief sought—the quieting of title to the property—could be accorded to plaintiff where the current title holder is not named as a party. Even if we were to take all of plaintiff’s allegations as true and assume that the assignment to Bank of New York was invalid, Bank of New York would nevertheless be a party claiming an interest that would be affected by the declaratory relief sought by plaintiff.', 'In his papers submitted to this Court, plaintiff “concurs with the conclusion that the interests of all parties in a title clearing action must be protected.” He urges us, however, to adopt a “pragmatic approach” and conclude that Bank of New York was sufficiently on notice and suffered no prejudice. He asserts that the purported assignment from Sutton Funding was to “The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association as grantor trustee of the Protium Master Grantor Trust, c/o Homeeq. [sic], 4837 Watt Avenue, Suite 100, MC: CA3501, North Highlands CA, 95660.” As HomEq “was the contact for the Trust,” he posits, HomEq was clearly standing in the shoes of Bank of New York. Thus, he contends that he believed in good faith that naming HomEq in the complaint and having it served with process was “sufficient to put Bank of New York on notice of the fact that its interest would be impacted by this lawsuit.” He concludes by alleging that “Bank of New York is in this case by virtue of its incestuous relationship with [HomEq] and that its interests are being protected by [HomEq].”', 'We cannot accept plaintiff’s premise that naming HomEq in the complaint and serving it with process satisfies the clear requirements of Rule 19(a) or § 9-30-11.

36,State : v. : Pedro Marte.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Pedro Marte, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine. After a jury trial, the defendant was sentenced to a term of ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with two years to serve, and eight years suspended. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred: (1) by not excluding evidence that the defendant was carrying cash at the time of his arrest; and (2) in denying the defendant any remedy for the state’s late disclosure of that evidence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On September 13, 2010, at approximately 8 p.m., two Providence police detectives observed a vehicle idling in the parking lot of a Wendy’s restaurant at the corner of Public and', '-1- Eddy Streets in the City of Providence. Detective Kristopher Poplaski and his partner, Det. Patrick Potter, testified that there were two occupants in the vehicle, one of whom—passenger Seth McGough—was using a cell phone. Detective Poplaski testified that he observed a Nissan drive into the lot a short time later. The driver, whom Det. Poplaski identified as defendant, was also talking on a cell phone. According to Det. Poplaski, defendant pulled into the parking space next to McGough and then pulled back out of the space and drove out of the parking lot, towards Public Street. Detective Poplaski testified that McGough’s vehicle followed defendant’s out of the lot and down Public Street. Detectives Poplaski and Potter followed the two vehicles as they turned onto Temple Street. Detective Poplaski testified that defendant’s vehicle pulled over and parked on the side of the road, and McGough’s vehicle pulled up and parked immediately behind it.', 'According to Det. Poplaski, McGough exited his car and entered the front passenger side of defendant’s vehicle. At that point, Det. Poplaski recounted, Det. Potter drove by defendant’s vehicle “very slowly.” As their car drew alongside defendant’s vehicle, Det. Poplaski observed McGough hand something to defendant and defendant hand something to McGough in what he characterized as “a transaction that occurred very quickly.” The detectives exited their vehicle; and although Det. Potter arrested defendant immediately, McGough fled on foot. Detective Poplaski pursued McGough and witnessed as he placed something in his mouth.', 'As he approached McGough, Det. Poplaski recalled that he directed McGough to “spit it out.” According to Det. Poplaski, McGough spit two clear plastic bags of suspected cocaine onto the', '-2- ground. The substance in the bags was weighed and tested and determined to be 3.1 grams of cocaine. 1', 'Mr. McGough testified that, on the night of September 13, he was “[l]ooking to purchase drugs.” He recalled that, as he sat in the Wendy’s parking lot, he made the call to arrange to meet someone there to buy $100 worth of cocaine. Mr. McGough testified that, after getting into defendant’s vehicle, he purchased an “eight ball of cocaine” from defendant for approximately $100. 2', 'The defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i). On the morning that his trial was to begin, the state notified defendant that it intended to question one of the detectives about the contents of defendant’s wallet at the time of arrest.', 'The state averred that it had only received the information “[fifteen] minutes ago,” and that it consisted of the inventory of items in defendant’s possession upon arrest—a wallet and $185 cash.', 'The money was neither seized nor photographed, because department policy was to not seize any amount below $300.', 'The defendant made a motion in limine to exclude this evidence, arguing that it was a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and that it constituted an unfair surprise. 3 The trial justice ruled that the state’s late disclosure was not a violation of Rule 16. 1', 'Mr. McGough later pled nolo contendere to one count of possession of cocaine and two counts of simple assault, for which he received eighteen months of probation and 100 hours of community service. One count of resisting arrest was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2', 'According to Det. Poplaski, an eight ball of cocaine is 3.5 grams and can be worth anywhere between $100 and $150. 3', 'This Court has stated that Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the state to turn over “prior recorded statements, a summary of their expected trial testimony, and any records of the[] prior convictions” of any witnesses the state intends to call at trial. State v. Huffman, 68 A.3d 558, 568 (R.I. 2013) (quoting DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 570 (R.I. 2011)).', '-3- Accordingly, he declined to “suppress” the evidence, but he allowed defendant a brief adjournment in order to decide whether to accept the state’s plea offer or proceed with trial.', 'At the conclusion of the trial, the state represented to the court that, during the brief adjournment, the state came to an agreement with defendant to not ask how much money was found on him. There was testimony that defendant had cash on him at the time of the arrest and that it was not seized because it was less than $300, but no amount was named. On April 23, 2012, the jury found defendant guilty, and he was sentenced on July 2, 2012. On July 12, 2012, defendant timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“We review the grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of discretion.” Fravala v. City of Cranston ex rel. Baron, 996 A.2d 696, 702 (R.I. 2010).', '“When reviewing a determination of whether a Rule 16 violation occurred, this Court applies a narrow standard of review: ‘the trial justice must have committed clear error.’” State v. Farley, 962 A.2d 748, 752- 53 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Stravato, 935 A.2d 948, 951 (R.I. 2007)). “The discovery ruling of a trial justice ‘will not be overturned absent a clear abuse of discretion.’” Id. at 753 (quoting Stravato, 935 A.2d at 951).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying him any remedy for the state’s last-minute disclosure that cash was found on him at the time of arrest. The defendant asserts that, because the cash was not listed in the seizure report, the disclosure was an unfair', '-4- surprise that was highly prejudicial, and that the trial justice erred by not granting his motion in limine.', 'Rule 16(a) requires the state to provide discovery to defendant of evidence “the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the attorney for the State.” Rule 16(h) provides that the state has a continuing duty to disclose such evidence; “[i]f, subsequent to compliance with a request for discovery * * * and prior to or during trial, a party discovers additional material previously requested which is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule, he or she shall promptly notify the other party of the existence thereof.”', 'Just prior to trial, the state disclosed to defendant that an inventory of items in his “traps” 4 on September 13 listed “cash, $185.” Counsel for the state represented to the court that he received the information “this morning about 15 minutes ago.” The defendant did not contend that the late disclosure was intentional.', '“A trial justice considering an alleged discovery violation pursuant to Rule 16 * * * should examine four factors: (1) the reason for the nondisclosure; (2) the prejudice to the other party; (3) whether or not a continuance can rectify any such prejudice; and (4) any other relevant factors.” State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 828 (R.I. 2008). The trial justice accepted the state’s representation that the late disclosure was not intentional, and he next considered whether defendant was prejudiced by the information. In response to the trial justice’s questioning, defense counsel stated that “possibly it would have changed the structure of the entire case, whether or not it would have gone to trial * * * .” The defendant’s counsel asserted that it was her understanding that there “was no money here” because it was not included in the seizure 4', 'During his testimony, Det. Potter offered this explanation of a “traps bag”: “It’s property -- when you’re arrested, any property that you have on you can’t go into the cell with you, so it’s placed in a bag, sealed and labeled * * * just to identify what you have * * *.”', '-5- report. Counsel conceded that she was aware of McGough’s statement that he had paid money to defendant.', 'The trial justice found that there was no violation, stating:', '“From a legal point of view, I don’t believe there’s a legal', 'basis upon which I am required to suppress the evidence. Since', 'there was no specific indication that there was no money found,', 'and the defendant, through counsel, had notice of what the', 'codefendant alleged that he, in fact, paid money, I can’t find as a', 'matter of law it’s a Rule 16 violation.” Despite finding no violation, the trial justice then allowed a short recess, during which the parties spoke and came to an agreement that the state would not ask how much money was in defendant’s possession and that testimony regarding the cash would be limited to the fact that there was money and it was less than $300.', 'We have stated that “the trial justice is in the best position to evaluate whether any prejudice has resulted from noncompliance with discovery motions.” Grant, 946 A.2d at 828 (quoting State v. Evans, 668 A.2d 1256, 1259 (R.I. 1996)). Here, after the trial justice granted a brief recess, the parties reached an agreement. Detective Potter then testified that defendant had cash, but that it was not seized, and that it was less than $300. Further, Det. Potter testified that “we never seize less than $300.” The jury, therefore, could not know whether defendant’s wallet contained one dollar or some other amount up to $299.', 'Given our deferential standard of review, we find no clear error on the part of the trial justice. The fact that the defendant had some amount of cash on his person at the time of arrest is not unfairly prejudicial; and, indeed, jurors may likely suppose that most people have some amount of cash in their wallets at any given time. Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to deny the defendant’s motion in limine.', '-6-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

37,State : v. : Rafael Ferrer.,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Rafael Ferrer, was convicted by a jury on one count of carrying a pistol without a license and one count of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence. He has appealed from that conviction. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 20, 2011, the State of Rhode Island filed a criminal information charging defendant with one count of carrying a pistol without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-', '-1- 8(a) (Count One) and one count of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-5 (Count Two).1', 'Prior to trial, defendant stipulated that he had been previously convicted of a crime that satisfied the predicate offense element set forth in § 11-47-5. So that the jury would not learn of that criminal history, defendant agreed that, if he was convicted on Count One, he would “automatically be adjudged convicted” on Count Two. Accordingly, a jury trial was held on Count One in October and November of 2011. We summarize below the salient aspects of what occurred at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Trooper Brent Pereira', 'Massachusetts State Police Trooper Brent Pereira testified at trial.', 'It was Trooper Pereira’s testimony that he was working on the evening of September 12 and the early morning hours of September 13, 2010 as part of a construction detail on Interstate 195 in Seekonk, Massachusetts. He testified that he left the construction detail and began following a “dark- colored green Toyota Rav4” in a westerly direction on Interstate 195; he did so after receiving a radio message advising him to be on the lookout for a dark-colored sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that was possibly traveling towards Providence. He further testified that that radio message also informed him that the SUV had multiple occupants (“most likely three”), who were described as being dark-skinned Hispanic males. It was his testimony that, while following the SUV, he drove his police cruiser alongside the right side and then the left side of the SUV and that he illuminated the interior of the SUV with his “cruiser-mounted spotlight” from both sides in order 1', 'The defendant was also charged in that criminal information with one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is a fugitive from justice in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-5 (Count Three), but the state dismissed that count pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-2- to observe the occupants; he added that he observed a female driver and three male occupants, who appeared to him to be dark-skinned. According to Trooper Pereira’s testimony, he decided to continue to follow the SUV as it drove into Rhode Island so that he could conduct a motor vehicle stop when “backup” became available; he learned that there would be “backup” available on the right side of westbound Interstate 195 just before the Iway Bridge.', 'Trooper Pereira testified that, as he approached the bridge, he saw that there were other state police cruisers occupying the breakdown lane as well as the right travel lane just before the beginning of the bridge; he stated that the cruisers had their overhead red and blue emergency lights activated. Trooper Pereira added that he turned on his emergency lights to signal the SUV to pull over. He testified that the SUV drove past the other police cruisers and came to a stop in front of them; he added that the guardrail on the right side of the bridge was approximately three or four feet from the passenger’s side of the vehicle. Trooper Pereira further testified that he stopped his cruiser at a point between ten and fifteen feet behind the SUV. According to his testimony, there were overhead lights on the bridge, and he had his headlights, searchlight, and “takedown” lights (bright white lights located on the light bar on top of the cruiser) fixed on the back of the SUV. He answered in the affirmative when asked on direct examination whether he could “clearly see into the rear of that vehicle,” and he stated that he observed two black males in the backseat of the SUV. Trooper Pereira also stated: “I opened my cruiser door and I stepped half way out and I got onto my PA system.” According to his testimony, he then saw that the passenger in the right rear seat of the SUV had moved slightly to the side and extended most of his arm out of the right rear window. He further testified that he observed a “grayish metallic object released from [that] arm and go over the guardrail.” It was Trooper Pereira’s testimony that he turned and mentioned to a Rhode Island trooper that he had seen one of the passengers', '-3- throw something over the guardrail; he added that troopers then searched the area below the bridge.', 'Trooper Pereira testified that he then proceeded to instruct the occupants of the SUV to place their hands on the ceiling while remaining inside of the SUV. He further testified that he instructed the right rear passenger to extend his arm outside of the door through the window and to open the door from the outside, walk to the trooper’s location, and assume a kneeling position; he added that, after the right rear passenger complied, he asked the man his name and was informed that it was Rafael Ferrer. At trial, he identified defendant as the right rear passenger of the SUV. Trooper Pereira stated that, after all four occupants of the SUV were in custody, another trooper directed his attention to the area below the bridge to the right side of where the SUV was stopped. He stated that he observed a firearm on an abutment approximately twenty to twenty-five feet down.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Trooper Daniel Hernandez', 'Rhode Island State Police Trooper Daniel Hernandez testified next. Trooper Hernandez testified that, shortly after 12 a.m. on September 13, 2010, he responded to the Iway Bridge to assist a Massachusetts State Trooper, whom he identified as being Trooper Pereira, in connection with a motor vehicle stop. Trooper Hernandez testified that, when he arrived at the Iway Bridge, Trooper Pereira’s cruiser was parked behind a dark-colored SUV in the breakdown lane and that he was outside of his car, giving instructions to the right rear passenger of the SUV to slowly exit the vehicle. At trial, Trooper Hernandez identified defendant as the right rear passenger.', 'Trooper Hernandez testified that he then spoke to Trooper Pereira, who informed him that he had “observed the occupant throw something out of the vehicle and it went over the side', '-4- of the bridge.” Trooper Hernandez stated that he went “down around to the intersection of Tockwotton Street and South Water Street” in order to investigate the area that was below the bridge and perpendicular to the passenger’s side of the SUV. In response to being asked why he focused on that area, he stated:', '“Because it was below the vehicle. Lined up. It made sense. If', 'something was thrown from a vehicle, it would -- it could --', 'likelihood that it would land there.” Trooper Hernandez testified that, after climbing up to the second tier of the bridge abutment, he found a handgun lying on its side approximately fifteen to twenty-five feet below and ten to fifteen feet perpendicular to the part of the bridge where the SUV was positioned; he added that, from where he was standing when he discovered the handgun, he could see the SUV. He testified that there were four or five live ammunition rounds around the handgun and that there was one “spent cartridge that was half in the cylinder of the revolver.” He testified that, although the abutment was dirty and sandy, the handgun was not. Trooper Hernandez identified the handgun shown to him at trial as being the same one that he had observed on the abutment.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Corporal John Grassel', 'Rhode Island State Police Corporal John Grassel also testified at trial, after first having been qualified by the trial justice as an “expert in crime scene evidence collection.” He testified that, on the morning of September 13, 2010, he was called to assist other troopers at a crime scene located at “South Water and Tockwotton Street * * * in the area of the Iway Bridge.” He stated that at that crime scene he recovered from the bridge abutment a .38 caliber revolver, one cartridge casing which was partially inside one of the chambers of the gun, and five cartridges in the immediate vicinity of the weapon; he identified the handgun entered into evidence at trial as', '-5- being the same handgun that he observed on September 13, 2010. When he was shown at trial a photograph of the handgun lying on the abutment, Corporal Grassel pointed out that the photograph showed a glass bottle near the handgun, and he testified that he had observed that glass bottle when he recovered the handgun near the abutment. Corporal Grassel stated that, while there was debris including sand, gravel, and cigarette butts on the abutment where he recovered the gun, “the firearm was relatively clean, as far as soot or soil,” whereas the bottle “had a layer of soot or sand on it.”', 'According to Corporal Grassel’s testimony, the firearm was tested for fingerprints approximately six months after it was seized. He further testified that there were no latent fingerprints on “the cartridges, the cartridge, the cartridge casing, or the weapon;” however, he added that the chance of finding fingerprints “would definitely be less after six months.” Corporal Grassel stated that the bottle was neither seized nor processed for fingerprints. He also stated that it was determined that the firearm had been lawfully purchased in Maine; it was his testimony, however, that he never inquired of the registered owner (who was not defendant) as to how the firearm came to be located on the bridge abutment.', 'D', 'Stipulations and the Defendant’s Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', 'Following Corporal Grassel’s testimony, it was then stipulated: (1) that, on September 13, 2010, defendant did not have a duly issued license to carry or possess a firearm; and (2) that the firearm at issue was operable on that date. At the close of the prosecution’s case, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice found that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient to warrant a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt', '-6- on Count One and, therefore, automatically, on Count Two. In denying defendant’s motion, the trial justice stated:', '“The evidence, if viewed in that regard, together with all', 'reasonable inferences, the testimony is that the officer viewed the', 'individual, later to be identified by him as your client, in the right', 'rear passenger seat of the vehicle throwing a metal object, as he', 'described it, out of the window of the vehicle over the wall of the', 'bridge. Later, the area was inspected below that parapet. The only', 'thing that was found was a firearm and an old bottle, the inference', 'fairly being that this was the object that was thrown from the', 'vehicle and thrown by your client.” After the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the defense proceeded to present its case.', 'E', 'The Testimony of Lina Leav', 'The driver of the SUV, Lina Leav, testified for the defense. She testified that she was driving her 2002 Toyota Rav4 SUV westbound on Interstate 195 on the night of September 12 and the early morning hours of September 13, 2010. Ms. Leav testified that Rafael Ferrer, a friend of her boyfriend, was a passenger in the SUV and that he was seated in the rear seat on the driver’s side (the left side); she added that a man named Pablo, whom she had met that night and whose last name she did not know, was sitting in the rear seat on the passenger’s side (the right side). She further testified that, as she was entering Providence near the Iway Bridge, she was pulled over by a State Police cruiser. It was her testimony that she drove past the police cruisers that were already positioned in the breakdown lane and parked on the bridge; she added that the police cruiser which signaled her to pull over then stopped approximately one car length behind her SUV—at an angle so that the cruiser was “closest to the driver’s rear quarter” of her SUV. She stated that the trooper told her and the other occupants to put their hands on the ceiling and', '-7- then asked them to “roll” down the windows. She also testified that the trooper told the passengers to exit the SUV one by one, opening the car doors by extending their arms through the open windows. According to her testimony, Pablo, who occupied the rear passenger’s seat, was the first person to exit the SUV, followed by defendant, Rafael Ferrer.', 'Ms. Leav testified that no one threw anything out of the SUV when it was being pulled over because the windows were rolled up. She further testified that she did not see anything thrown out of the windows when the trooper requested that the windows be rolled down. It was her testimony, however, that her attention was focused “only” on the state trooper, and her testimony indicated that she observed him by using her “driver door mirror.” She answered in the affirmative when asked on cross-examination if she was not paying attention to the backseat passengers.', 'F', 'The Defendant’s Renewed Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal, the Jury Instructions, and', 'Defense Counsel’s Closing Argument', 'At the close of defendant’s case, defense counsel renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal; the trial justice again denied the motion “for the reasons given previously by the court.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to instruct the jury. Among the instructions given to the jury, the trial justice stated that the jury should not consider punishment in its deliberations because punishment “should never be considered by the jury in any way in arriving at an impartial verdict.”', 'Defense counsel thereafter made his closing argument to the jury, during which the following exchange occurred between defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial justice:', '-8-', '“[Defense Counsel]: There should be some corroboration of the', 'facts of this case. How many times have you heard recently in the', 'news people who are serving 20 years in jail for a rape or murder', 'they didn’t commit?', '“[State]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: I’m not going to stand for that. I told this jury', 'that issues relating to punishment shouldn’t even be a topic of their', 'discussions, and it better not be in -- continue to be part of your', 'comments.', '“[Defense Counsel]: That wasn’t my intention, but my point is', 'every day people are found to have not committed a crime --', '“[State]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: Be careful, [Defense Counsel].', '“[Defense Counsel]: I understand, Judge. -- because of scientific', 'evidence.

The defense never had the', 'opportunity to have that weapon fingerprinted. It was in the', 'custody of the State Police.', '“[State]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: Sustain that objection.”', 'Ultimately, the jury found defendant guilty on Count One.', 'The trial justice then proceeded to rule, pursuant to the parties’ pretrial stipulation, that defendant was also automatically guilty on Count Two.', 'In due course, on January 12, 2012, the trial justice sentenced defendant to two concurrent terms of ten years to serve on Counts One and Two. Defense counsel agreed that defendant was subject to the habitual offender statute codified in G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21, and the trial justice, pursuant to that statute, also sentenced defendant to a term of twenty years', '-9- imprisonment, with eight years to serve without the possibility of parole and the remaining twelve years suspended, with probation, to run consecutively to the ten-year sentences.', 'The defendant filed a notice of appeal on February 10, 2012.2 On appeal, defendant makes two arguments: (1) that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal; and (2) that the trial justice “violated his right to assistance of counsel under the United States and Rhode Island constitutions by improperly restricting defense counsel’s closing argument.”', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence presented at trial did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that “Mr. Ferrer (and not another occupant) threw a gun (and not another object) out of the SUV.” (Parentheticals in original.)', 'Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “a judgment of acquittal shall be entered when the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain a conviction.” State v.

Mondesir, 891 A.2d 856, 861 (R.I. 2006).', 'The defendant supports his argument that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal by emphasizing: (1) that not one of the state troopers at the scene, other than Trooper Pereira, saw defendant throw an object from the window of the SUV; (2) that Trooper Pereira could not identify the object that he alleged was thrown from the SUV by defendant as a gun; (3) that the discovery of the gun on the bridge abutment was insufficient to prove that it was the particular object that had been allegedly thrown from the SUV; and (4) that Trooper Pereira was unable to see the face of the individual who allegedly threw the object because he was positioned behind the SUV and based his conclusion that defendant had thrown the gun only on his belief that it was defendant who was the right rear passenger in the SUV.', '- 11 -', 'We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments. This Court, like the trial justice, “is required to evaluate only that evidence that the prosecution claims is capable of supporting proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Cardin, 987 A.2d at 250. Drawing all inferences in favor of the state, we are convinced that the testimony of Troopers Pereira and Hernandez as well as that of Corporal Grassel was sufficient to support the conviction.', 'It was adduced at trial that Trooper Pereira saw an individual, later identified by him as defendant, who was seated in the right rear passenger’s seat of the SUV, throw a “grayish metallic” object out of the window of the SUV; according to Trooper Pereira’s testimony, the object went over the guardrail of the bridge. Trooper Hernandez corroborated Trooper Pereira’s testimony that defendant was the right rear passenger in the SUV; and he stated that, when he inspected an abutment below the bridge and perpendicular to the passenger’s side of the SUV, he observed a firearm. Although defendant notes that Ms. Leav’s testimony with respect to the positions of the passengers in the car was contradictory to the testimony of Troopers Pereira and Hernandez, this Court has stated that we “[do] not pass upon the credibility of witnesses in determining whether a judgment of acquittal was warranted.” State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 446 (R.I. 2013); see also State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (stating that, in reviewing a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, “we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Corporal Grassel additionally testified that the only items he observed on the abutment were a firearm and a glass bottle; and he added that the glass bottle had “a layer of soot or sand on it” whereas the firearm was “relatively clean.” When viewing this evidence in the light most', '- 12 - favorable to the state, we are satisfied that a logical and reasonable inference could be drawn that the handgun found on the abutment was the object that was thrown from the SUV and that it was thrown by defendant. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the state produced sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the handgun.3', 'After a careful review of the evidence presented in the instant case and considering that evidence in the light most favorable to the state, giving full credibility to its witnesses and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with defendant’s guilt, it is clear to us, as it was to the trial justice, that there was more than sufficient evidence submitted at trial to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, the trial justice did not err when he denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal.', 'B', 'Defense Counsel’s Closing Argument', 'The defendant’s second argument on appeal is that he is entitled to a new trial because, in his view, the trial justice “violated his right to assistance of counsel under the United States and Rhode Island constitutions by improperly restricting defense counsel’s closing argument.” The defendant focuses on two points in the closing argument as to each of which he contends that there was an improper restriction on defense counsel’s argument. We shall address each in turn.', 'We have recognized that “final argument is a vital part of the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States * * * .” State v. 3', 'It will be recalled that it was stipulated during the course of trial that defendant did not have a license to possess a firearm on September 13, 2010 and that the firearm was operable on that date.', 'The defendant had also stipulated prior to trial that he would “automatically be adjudged convicted” on Count Two if he was convicted on Count One.', '- 13 - Pemental, 434 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 1981); see Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975) (“In a criminal trial, which is in the end basically a factfinding process, no aspect of such advocacy could be more important than the opportunity finally to marshal the evidence for each side before submission of the case to judgment.”). It is well settled, however, “that the conduct of a trial in the Superior Court is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Barnes v. Quality Beef Co., 425 A.2d 531, 534 (R.I. 1981). And, “[i]t is a long-standing rule of law that the trial justice sitting in a jury trial may, in the exercise of his [or her] sound discretion, limit the scope and extent of counsel’s closing argument.” Id. at 535; see also State v. Frost, 161 P.3d 361, 365 (Wash. 2007) (en banc) (“It is well established that trial courts possess broad discretionary powers over the scope of counsel’s closing arguments.”). In State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418 (R.I. 1993), we expressly alluded to the broad discretion accorded to the trial justice with respect to ensuring that closing argument “does not stray unduly from the mark, or otherwise impede the fair and orderly conduct of the trial.” Id. at 422 (internal quotation marks omitted). The following passage from Ellis is directly relevant to the instant case:', '“This is not to say that closing arguments in a criminal case', 'must be uncontrolled or even unrestrained. The presiding judge', 'must be and is given great latitude in controlling the duration and', 'limiting the scope of closing summations. * * * He may ensure that', 'argument does not stray unduly from the mark, or otherwise', 'impede the fair and orderly conduct of the trial. In all these', 'respects he must have broad discretion.” Id. (quoting Herring, 422', 'U.S. at 862).', 'It is defendant’s first contention that defense counsel, during the first objected-to portion of the closing argument, was seeking to draw attention to the dearth of corroborative evidence tying defendant to the handgun found below the bridge.4', 'The defendant argues that the 4', 'It will be recalled that the prosecutor interposed an objection after defense counsel had uttered the following two sentences: “There should be some corroboration of the facts of this', '- 14 - “rhetorical question regarding the wrongly convicted was in reference to the lack of evidence against [him] and was not an improper comment on sentencing,” and he then contends that the trial justice erred “by sustaining the state’s objection to this permissible comment on the dearth of direct evidence against [defendant].”', 'A review of the record, however, reveals that the trial justice did not sustain the state’s objection to defense counsel’s statement, nor did he strike that statement from the record. The trial justice instead admonished defendant that issues relating to punishment should not “continue to be part of [his] comments,” and the trial justice referred to his explicit prior instruction to the jury that punishment “should never be considered by the jury in any way in arriving at an impartial verdict.” It is worth noting that the entire colloquy took place in the presence of the jury; and, therefore, the jury heard defense counsel’s clear argument regarding what he contended was a lack of corroborating evidence in the case at bar. In our judgment, the cautionary language of the trial justice with respect to defense counsel’s mention of “people who are serving 20 years in jail” cannot be construed as a limitation on defendant’s closing argument; it was simply a reminder to counsel that punishment was not a permissible topic. Accordingly, we see no merit in the first of defendant’s contentions as to the violation of his right to the assistance of counsel.', 'The defendant’s second contention in relation to the closing argument is that the trial justice improperly curtailed defense counsel’s opportunity to present the case to the jury by sustaining the state’s objection to defense counsel’s statement “pointing out the undisputed fact that the gun had been in the custody of the Rhode Island State Police since the date of the alleged offense.” Immediately after the colloquy with the court that we discussed in the preceding case. How many times have you heard recently in the news people who are serving 20 years in jail for a rape or murder they didn’t commit?” See Part I.F., supra.', '- 15 - paragraph, defense counsel proceeded to state in the presence of the jury: “The defense never had the opportunity to have that weapon fingerprinted. It was in the custody of the State Police.” At that point, the prosecutor objected, which objection was sustained by the trial justice. It is defendant’s argument on appeal that “[d]efense counsel was entitled to argue that[,] without fingerprints, Mr. Ferrer could not, unfortunately, be exonerated by scientific evidence” and that his assertion that the firearm had been in the custody of the police “tied in with defense counsel’s argument that the state may have greatly reduced the likelihood of successful fingerprinting by waiting to test until six months after the gun was seized, test-fired, and repeatedly handled * * * .”', 'We do not find defendant’s argument to be at all persuasive. We agree with the state’s assertion in its written submission to this Court that defense counsel’s statement tended to imply, misleadingly, to the jury that the state “had acted deliberately to violate [defendant’s] rights.” Nothing in the record indicates that defendant at any point sought to have a fingerprint test performed on the firearm or was prevented by the state from doing so. It was well within the trial justice’s discretion to sustain the state’s entirely proper objection in order to ensure that the closing argument did “not stray unduly from the mark.” Ellis, 619 A.2d at 422 (quoting Herring, 422 U.S. at 862).', 'It is our definite opinion that no limitation on closing argument occurred at the time of the first objection and that the trial justice properly sustained the state’s subsequent objection to defense counsel’s statement with respect to the fingerprinting of the handgun.

38,: State : : v. : : Lakesha Garrett.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Lakesha Garrett, appeals from a judgment of conviction on one count of voluntary manslaughter. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence and was otherwise clearly wrong in denying her motion for a new trial because, in her view, the state failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not act in self-defense when she (as her brief states) “grabbed a kitchen knife to protect herself from imminent death or serious bodily injury at the hands of Gary Mitchell.” For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 15, 2009, defendant fatally stabbed Gary Mitchell after a violent altercation. Subsequently, on February 26, 2010, a Providence County grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with the murder of Mr. Mitchell in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-', '-1- 23-2. In due course, a jury trial took place in May of 2011. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Dr. Alexander Chrikov', 'Doctor Alexander Chrikov, a medical examiner in the Office of State Medical Examiners, offered expert testimony as to the cause of Mr. Mitchell’s death. He testified that, in his opinion, Mr. Mitchell died from a “[s]tab wound of the chest with injury of pulmonary artery and aorta;” he added that the manner of Mr. Mitchell’s death was homicide.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Keneisha Roberts', 'Keneisha Roberts testified for the state. She testified that, on October 15, 2009, she was pregnant and living in one of the two rooms that were in the basement of a “three-family apartment house” on Harrison Street in Providence; she added that her grandfather, Norman Cornish, lived in the other room. Ms. Roberts further testified that Mr. Cornish’s room was in the front of the basement closer to stairs that led outdoors, whereas her room was in the back. Several photographs of Mr. Cornish’s room and the surrounding area in the basement were entered into evidence at trial; it appears from those photographs that inside Mr. Cornish’s room, to the right of the door, there was a counter area with cooking utensils and cooking equipment. Those photographs further indicate that inside the room, to the left of the same door, there were a nightstand, a bed, and a television set. The photographs also indicate that there was a door from the basement hallway into Mr. Cornish’s room and that, in order to go outside from the basement, one would have to walk up approximately seven or eight steps to a landing, up three more steps to a door, and then down five steps to the front lawn.', '-2-', 'Ms. Roberts testified that, on the afternoon of the incident at issue, she observed Mr. Cornish and defendant “getting ready to smoke crack.” She stated that sometime thereafter Mr. Cornish’s friend, Gary Mitchell (the victim), arrived, went into Mr. Cornish’s room, and shut the door. She added that, “after they were done smoking,” she went inside Mr. Cornish’s room to prepare some food, returning to her own room a short time later to take a nap.', 'Ms. Roberts stated that, earlier that day before she left to take a nap, she had observed that defendant and Mr. Mitchell were arguing about his taking her belongings, including her liquor and cigarettes—even though she had told him not to do so; Ms. Roberts also acknowledged that she and defendant had called Mr. Mitchell a “hypocrite” because, in their view, he participated in a church choir solely for the money. Ms. Roberts stated that, as it appeared to her, those two incidents caused Mr. Mitchell to become angry.', 'Ms. Roberts proceeded to testify that she was awakened from her nap by the sound of “screaming and crashing” coming from Mr. Cornish’s room. She further testified that, when she entered Mr. Cornish’s room, she saw Mr. Mitchell “choking [defendant] from behind and punching her in her face really hard.” She stated that, although defendant was “chunkier” than Mr. Mitchell, he was “more muscular.”1 It was Ms. Roberts’s testimony that she yelled at Mr. Mitchell to “get off of” defendant; it was her further testimony that she attempted to “physically try to remove him” but that her efforts to do so were unsuccessful.', 'Ms. Roberts testified that Mr. Cornish then entered the room, and she described what he did as follows:', '“My grandfather tried to get in-between them while Gary', '[Mitchell] was still choking Lakesha but finally he got ahold of 1', 'The autopsy report prepared by Dr. Chirkov which was entered into evidence at trial indicates that Mr. Mitchell was five feet five inches tall. According to defendant’s testimony, she is five feet three inches tall.', '-3-', 'Gary and he was in the back of the room like bear hugging him,', 'right, to keep him away from Lakesha because he was still trying', 'to get to her.” Ms. Roberts testified that Mr. Cornish also moved a chair to the middle of the room while trying to maneuver Mr. Mitchell farther away from defendant. Ms. Roberts additionally testified that, even though Mr. Cornish was pulling Mr. Mitchell away from defendant, Mr. Mitchell nonetheless succeeded in pushing defendant into the door that led from the room to the hallway; she added that the door broke from the impact of defendant’s body and that defendant then fell to the ground. It was Ms. Roberts’s further testimony that, after being pushed into the door, defendant was “really stunned” and “started crying and going crazy and talking to herself.” She testified that defendant said: “I can’t believe you did this to my face. I can’t believe you punched me in my face. How dare you[?]” Ms. Roberts stated that she observed defendant “reach to the top of the microwave to try to steady herself to get up” off the floor and that, in the process, defendant ended up knocking over certain kitchen items that were located on a piece of plywood above the microwave. According to Ms. Roberts’s testimony, defendant then began searching for something on the counter and stopped doing so when she found “a big kitchen knife.” Ms. Roberts stated that, when defendant grabbed the knife, she was approximately two inches from the damaged door, whereas Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Cornish were on the other side of the room (farthest from the door). Ms. Roberts also stated that defendant was still “ranting” at that point, saying: “I’ll kill you, you missed [sic] up my face.”', 'Ms. Roberts testified that then, because Mr. Cornish did not have a very good hold on Mr. Mitchell, he “ended up coming – as if he was coming toward [defendant].” She added that, at that point, defendant “was going toward him so it was like they were lunging at each other.” It was Ms. Roberts’s testimony that defendant took approximately five steps towards Mr. Mitchell', '-4- and that, when “[t]hey met in the middle” of the room, defendant stabbed him twice with the knife. Ms. Roberts stated that Mr. Mitchell then “fell on top of” the chair which was located between the two of them and that defendant then fell on top of Mr. Mitchell.2 She further stated that she saw defendant attempt to stab Mr. Mitchell approximately three or four times during the incident at issue. She testified that she then left the room where the stabbing had occurred and went upstairs3 to call an ambulance.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Norman Cornish', 'Norman Cornish, the grandfather of Ms. Roberts, also testified for the state. He testified that, on October 15, 2009, defendant had been staying with him in his room in the basement apartment on Harrison Street. Mr. Cornish further testified that, on that date, Mr. Mitchell came to the apartment and brought alcohol with him, which Mr. Mitchell and defendant began drinking.', 'Mr. Cornish testified that, at some point during that afternoon, he left the apartment for approximately forty-five minutes and that, upon his return, defendant told him, in Mr. Mitchell’s presence, that Mr. Mitchell was “disrespecting her, * * * was taking her beers [and] cigarettes and * * * was making sexual advances towards her.” Mr. Cornish also stated that, although Mr. Mitchell had remained quiet while defendant was talking, she went over to Mr. Mitchell and 2', 'On recross-examination, Ms. Roberts answered in the affirmative when asked if Mr. Mitchell fell “[b]ackwards in the area of the chair.” Ms. Roberts’s testimony is therefore unclear as to whether Mr. Mitchell had in fact advanced past the chair towards defendant before he was stabbed. 3', 'Despite Ms. Roberts’s testimony that she left Mr. Cornish’s room and went upstairs after the stabbing, she responded in the affirmative when asked on cross-examination “if [defendant] had wanted to exit that room, the door was broken, right?” She also acknowledged that there was debris in front of the broken door. She additionally testified that, when the paramedics arrived, they broke off part of the door to get inside Mr. Cornish’s room.', '-5- “gave him a little slap behind the ear.” He added that defendant then grabbed a two-prong fork used for “carving food” and held it to the side of Mr. Mitchell’s neck, stating: “[Y]ou don’t want to see the bad side of me.” He further testified that defendant, at his request, gave him the fork, which he put away. He said that he thereafter went outside to take out the garbage.', 'Mr. Cornish testified that, on his way back to the basement, he heard Ms. Roberts saying: “[G]et off of her, Gary; stop sitting [on] her, Gary; leave her alone, Gary.” Mr. Cornish further testified that, when he opened the door to his room, he saw Mr. Mitchell “choking [defendant] up against the wall.” When Mr. Cornish was confronted on cross-examination with his October 15th statement to the police, he stated (describing the incident in a manner that differed from what he had said on direct examination) that he told Mr. Mitchell to let defendant go and that he “grabbed” him and “took his hands away” from defendant. Mr. Cornish stated that Mr. Mitchell then shoved defendant backwards with his hand and that she “fell back and hit the door,” which he stated was “totally demolished” from the impact of her body; he added that she also “knocked over the shelf [in the kitchen area] where the knife was” resting.', 'Mr. Cornish stated that, at that point, defendant was in front of the door and that he and Mr. Mitchell were at the back of the room, approximately four to five feet away from her. Mr. Cornish testified that Mr. Mitchell, whom he described as being “calm” and not “violent” at that time, then took a step forward towards defendant. Mr. Cornish further testified that defendant stood up from the floor with the knife in her hand; he added that he believed that Mr. Mitchell was trying to leave, but backed up when he saw the knife in defendant’s hand. It was Mr. Cornish’s testimony that defendant thereafter took three steps towards Mr. Mitchell and then “struck him three times” with the knife. Mr. Cornish stated that defendant and Mr. Mitchell then', '-6- both fell to the floor and that defendant, at his request, gave him the knife, which he placed outside his room.4', 'D', 'The Defendant’s Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', 'At the close of the prosecution’s case, defense counsel made a motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which motion was directed at only the charge of first-degree murder. The trial justice granted defendant’s motion. After the trial justice’s ruling on the Rule 29 motion, the defense then proceeded to present its case.', 'E', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant, Lakesha Garrett, testified in her own defense. She testified that, on October 15, 2009, she was at Mr. Cornish’s apartment on Harrison Street, where Mr. Mitchell and Ms. Roberts were also present. She acknowledged on cross-examination that she had gone there “to use crack cocaine.” However, Ms. Garrett denied having used crack cocaine on the day of the stabbing—although she acknowledged that the results of the tests performed at the hospital after the stabbing indicated the presence of cocaine in her bloodstream.', 'It was defendant’s testimony that, at some point during the day when she was alone with Mr. Mitchell in Mr. Cornish’s room, he had taken her cigarettes from her lap and had touched her arms, breasts, and “between [her] legs;” she added that that touching “went on for quite a while.” She stated that Mr. Mitchell’s conduct made her a “little upset” but “[n]ot angry;” and she denied smacking Mr. Mitchell’s head, holding a meat fork to his neck, or threatening him. 4', 'The state presented additional witnesses at trial; however, we need not detail their testimony.', '-7- The defendant’s testimony was impeached by a recorded statement that she gave to the Providence police on October 16, 2009, which was played for the jury and entered into evidence as an exhibit, in which statement defendant admitted that she had threatened Mr. Mitchell. When the prosecutor asked defendant on cross-examination whether she had made such a statement to the police, she replied: “I did not say that.”', 'The defendant testified that, when Mr. Cornish left the apartment for the second time that day, she attempted to leave as well. However, she said that, as she was gathering her belongings on Mr. Cornish’s bed with her back turned towards Mr. Mitchell, he hit her head from behind.5 According to her testimony, Mr. Mitchell was choking her and punching her in the face when Ms. Roberts came into the room and screamed at Mr. Mitchell to “get off of her.” She testified that, at some point, she broke free from Mr. Mitchell, but she added that Mr. Mitchell was still holding her when she took “three steps” across the room to the area near the microwave. It was her testimony that she saw a spatula and then a knife; and, in explaining her decision to pick up the knife instead of the spatula, defendant stated that she “knew a spatula wasn’t going to keep him off of [her].” With respect to her intention when she picked up the knife, defendant stated: “I didn’t intend to hurt him. * * * I just wanted to keep him off of me. I only intended to brandish the knife.” According to defendant, she “thought [Mr. Mitchell] was going to kill [her].” When defendant was asked whether she was able to walk out of the apartment at any point during the incident, she stated: “I was not turning my back on [Mr. Mitchell].” 5', 'The defendant answered in the negative when asked on cross-examination whether she did anything to provoke Mr. Mitchell. However, she stated that “the hypocrite thing” (referring to the incident when she and Ms. Roberts called Mr. Mitchell a hypocrite, (see Part I.B, supra)) and her telling Mr. Cornish about Mr. Mitchell having taken her cigarettes and having touched her inappropriately made Mr. Mitchell “really angry.”', '-8-', 'The defendant testified on direct examination that she did not know how she stabbed Mr. Mitchell; she stated, however, that what she remembered about the altercation was that she “had the knife in [her] left hand and * * * was kind of hoarding [sic] off blows” from Mr. Mitchell. She subsequently testified on cross-examination that she had “just poked” him with the knife.6 She further testified that she did not remember how many times she had “poked” him, but she recalled that “all of a sudden” “he sat down in the chair,” which she testified was behind him.', 'The defendant’s testimony differed from that of Ms. Roberts and Mr. Cornish in some respects; and, at times, she also contradicted herself. During the course of her testimony, defendant denied several times that Mr. Cornish had been in the room during the altercation and that he had restrained Mr. Mitchell. It was additionally defendant’s testimony that no one (neither Ms. Roberts nor Mr. Cornish) attempted to pull Mr. Mitchell away from her. She claimed that Mr. Mitchell “never let off of” her during the incident, stating: “[H]e was behind me the whole time. I was trying to get to the door. I never got away from him.” Subsequently, however, the prosecutor asked defendant on cross-examination whether she was “standing at the door” after Mr. Mitchell pushed her into it. In response, defendant stated that she was not standing but was instead “on the floor;” and she responded in the negative when asked if Mr. Mitchell was also on the floor. She nonetheless later stated, also on cross-examination, that she did not remember being pushed into the door and that she had not been able to reach the door before she stabbed Mr. Mitchell. When the prosecutor asked defendant on cross-examination 6', 'The record indicates that, when defendant testified that she “poked” Mr. Mitchell with the knife, she also (in the words of the trial justice in ruling on defendant’s new trial motion) “demonstrated [that motion] at trial by waiving [sic] her knife-wielding arm above her shoulders and thrusting the knife into the air.”', 'Doctor Chirkov, the medical examiner, testified that Mr. Mitchell was stabbed five times in total; he added that, while four of the stab wounds were superficial, the fatal stab wound was the result of the penetration of the chest cavity to a depth of approximately four inches. The autopsy report indicated that four of the stab wounds were inflicted in a “downward” direction.', '-9- whether she remembered “ranting and raving and yelling about the fact that [Mr. Mitchell] hit [her] face,” she responded: “That did not happen.” She also denied walking towards Mr. Mitchell before stabbing him—in contrast to her account of the incident in the above-referenced recorded interview with the Providence police, during which she stated: “But, I turned around. I don’t know how I turned around. I began walking, I remember that.” (Emphasis added.)', 'F', 'The Jury Instructions, the Verdict, the New Trial Motion, and the Sentencing', 'After the closing arguments, the trial justice instructed the jury with respect to the law of second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and the defense of self-defense.

This Court has articulated the legal principles relative to the defense of self- defense as follows:', '“Under the law relating to self-defense, one may defend', 'oneself whenever one reasonably believes that he or she is in', 'imminent danger of bodily harm at the hands of another. Such a', 'person, having the fear, need not wait for the other to strike the', 'first blow. However, such a person must use only such force as is', 'reasonably necessary for his own protection.

Before resorting to the use of deadly force, however, “individuals [who are] attacked must attempt to retreat if they are consciously aware of an open, safe and available avenue of escape.” State v. Silvia, 836 A.2d 197, 200 (R.I. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Rieger, 763 A.2d 997, 1003 (R.I. 2001). It is also well settled that “one may not invoke the doctrine of self-defense if he or she has instigated the combative confrontation.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 631 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Martinez, 652 A.2d 958, 961 (R.I. 1995). We have stated that the “very essence of the defense of self-defense [hinges on] how the defendant perceived the situation at the time of the incident in question.” D’Amario, 568 A.2d at 1385 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Linde, 876 A.2d at 1129. We have also stated that “[o]nce a defendant introduces evidence of self-defense, the burden is on the state to negate that defense beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 1288 (R.I. 2006); see also In re John Doe, 120 R.I. 732, 742, 390 A.2d 920, 926 (1978). Bearing these principles in mind, we next turn to the trial justice’s consideration of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'In accordance with the first step in the new trial analytical process, the trial justice properly considered the evidence in light of the jury charge. The trial justice acknowledged that defendant had introduced adequate evidence to raise the issue of self-defense, which defense was referenced in the instructions to the jury. The trial justice stated that the jury could not have convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter without first concluding that the state had negated the defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. She proceeded to consider the evidence in light of the settled law of self-defense.', 'The trial justice comprehensively', '- 14 - summarized the trial proceedings in an “extensive fashion to ensure that all material aspects of the trial evidence, much of which was disjointed and confusingly presented,” were considered in her ruling; and she candidly noted the consistencies and inconsistencies in the evidence.', 'The trial justice then reached the second step of the required analysis, and independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. She found the testimony of Ms. Roberts to be the most credible, stating as follows:', '“[R]easonable jurors could have accepted the testimony of', 'Keneisha Roberts as to how the stabbing incident occurred, it was', 'the most credible testimony and the most complete and lacking', 'inconsistencies of the witnesses. And she was the most', 'disinterested * * * .', '“In addition, she had not been drinking and smoking crack,', 'presumably, like all the others had.” By contrast, with respect to the testimony of defendant, the trial justice found as follows:', '“Defendant’s testimony was replete with inconsistencies', 'and reflected a woman trying to reconstruct events to match how', 'she felt at the time or attempt to justify her actions based on those', 'feelings after the facts.”', 'It was the trial justice’s opinion (largely based on her crediting of Ms. Roberts’s testimony as to the brutality of the altercation between defendant and Mr. Mitchell) that a reasonable juror could have determined that, earlier on October 15, 2009, “defendant actually believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm and had reasonable grounds for that belief * * * .” Significantly, however, the trial justice further found that Mr. Mitchell’s shoving of defendant into the door constituted a “break in [that] action that affected the analysis of the evidence” from that point on. The trial justice explicitly noted that, after defendant was shoved into the door, she was on the opposite side of the room from Mr. Mitchell, who was being “guard[ed]” by Mr. Cornish, and the trial justice also noted that there was a chair between Mr.', '- 15 - Mitchell and defendant.7 The trial justice then expressly considered the fact that defendant thereafter chose to pick up the knife (instead of the spatula), did not seek to leave the room (even though she was closer to the exit than was Mr. Mitchell), and walked “at least five steps” towards Mr. Mitchell (who was unarmed) before she stabbed him.', 'The trial justice acknowledged that “a reasonable jury could have found that defendant subjectively believed she still was in imminent danger of bodily harm from Mr. Mitchell at this point in time perhaps because the defendant’s view of the situation was colored by emotion and the ingestion of substances.” But the trial justice also determined that a “reasonable jury could have found at that point the defendant was no longer in reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm and that she became the aggressor to retaliate in anger against Mr. Mitchell for his past deeds * * * .”', 'The trial justice then stated that, even if the jury found that defendant still believed she was in danger of imminent harm, it could have found that, by “plunging a knife four inches into [Mr. Mitchell’s] chest,” defendant used an amount of force that was not reasonably necessary for her own protection. The trial justice found “defendant’s testimony as to how she stabbed upward blind and into the air in fending off Mr. Mitchell” not to be credible, whereas she found the testimony of Ms. Roberts with respect to the stabbing to be credible. The trial justice also stated that it could be inferred from Ms. Roberts’s testimony that defendant’s “goal * * * seemed to be to stab Mr. Mitchell in the chest rather than stab to deter.” The trial justice noted that “the autopsy report * * * showed downward stab wounds consistent with the defendant being the 7', 'The defendant contends on appeal that the trial justice overlooked evidence that, in advancing towards defendant prior to the stabbing, Mr. Mitchell “maneuvered beyond [the] chair.” However, it was the opinion of the trial justice that, after considering the photographs of Mr. Cornish’s room in light of his testimony describing the respective locations of defendant and Mr. Mitchell prior to the stabbing and Ms. Roberts’s testimony that they met at the chair, “a jury could have reasonably concluded that Mr. Mitchell made little, if any, advancement toward defendant and defendant had to cross a much greater length of the room in order to ultimately stab Mr. Mitchell.”', '- 16 - aggressor.” Additionally, with respect to defendant’s ability to retreat, the trial justice stated that:', '“[D]efendant did not first try to retreat, even though she was near', 'the door and armed. She could have chose[n] to leave, albeit', 'having to stumble over debris and with the risk that Mr. Mitchell', 'would follow by backing her way out of the room and up the stairs', 'while remaining armed with a knife instead of walking toward and', 'lunging at Mr. Mitchell in a crazed state.” Accordingly, the trial justice found that “reasonable jurors could have found that [defendant] had an open, safe, available avenue of escape that was not sufficiently blocked in making it unopen or unavailable.”', 'Moving next to the third step in the new trial analytical process, the trial justice recognized that she was confronted with “a close case of self-defense” in view of what she described as the “abhorrent, violent actions of Mr. Mitchell toward defendant” preceding the stabbing, as well as the “drug and alcohol fueled emotions and distorted perceptions of both the defendant and victim.” Ultimately, however, the trial justice concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that the state had negated defendant’s defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Then, pursuant to step three of the required analysis, the trial justice proceeded to state:', '“This Court is in accord with the jury’s verdict, a sensible one', 'given all of the evidence, and finds that this does indeed do justice', 'in this case.” At that point, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Guerra, 12 A.3d at 765 (stating that if, after conducting the required three-step analysis, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, “then the inquiry is at an end and the motion for a new trial should be denied”).', '- 17 -', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Challenge to the Denial of a New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence and was otherwise clearly wrong in denying her motion for a new trial since, in her view, the state failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not act in self-defense when she stabbed Mr. Mitchell. The defendant presents two arguments in support of that contention, which we shall now address.', 'The defendant first asserts that she did not use excessive force when she stabbed Mr. Mitchell because “she was the victim of an unlawful and violent physical attack which left her in reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily injury.” The defendant contends that, in determining whether her use of deadly force was reasonable, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived evidence with respect to defendant’s physical condition after Mr. Mitchell’s assaultive conduct; in support of that contention, she cites State v. Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990 (R.I. 1990), and In re Paul F., 543 A.2d 255 (R.I. 1988). Although defendant correctly states that, under our law of self-defense, the reasonableness of a defendant’s actions must be considered in light of the then-present conditions and circumstances, including his or her physical condition, we cannot say that the trial justice’s analysis of the facts was clearly erroneous in that respect.', 'The defendant argues that, as a result of her altercation with Mr. Mitchell, she was in a “weakened condition,” “[e]xhausted,” and “disoriented” at the time that she picked up the knife and stabbed Mr. Mitchell. It is clear, however, that the evidence that defendant had been choked, repeatedly punched, and otherwise assaulted by Mr. Mitchell was before the jury and was referred to by the trial justice in her ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice specifically noted that Mr. Mitchell had perpetrated “particularly horrendous physical abuse”', '- 18 - against defendant, which had “almost killed” her.', 'Accordingly, we discern no merit in defendant’s argument that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence with respect to defendant’s physical condition in determining that a reasonable jury could find that defendant’s use of deadly force was unreasonable under the circumstances.8', 'The defendant’s second argument is that she was justified in using deadly force against Mr. Mitchell in self-defense because, “at the time of the confrontation, she was not consciously aware of an open, safe and available avenue of retreat.” The defendant emphasizes that “the existence of an ‘open’ and ‘available’ means of egress was dubious” in light of the evidence that the exit door was broken, that there was debris in front of it, and that defendant would have had to turn her back to Mr. Mitchell and navigate the stairs out of the basement. It will be recalled, however, that the trial justice specifically considered those facts in her ruling, finding that defendant could have chosen to leave “by backing her way out of the room,” “albeit having to stumble over debris and with the risk that Mr. Mitchell would follow [her] * * * .” We are unable to conclude that the trial justice clearly erred in finding that a reasonable jury could have found that there was an “available avenue of escape that was not sufficiently blocked in making it unopen or unavailable” and that, consequently, defendant was, as our law requires, obliged to attempt to retreat before using deadly force. See Silvia, 836 A.2d at 200; see also Rieger, 763 A.2d at 1003. The defendant also argues that, because the paramedics had to “break * * * down” 8', 'Before this Court, defendant attempts to frame an argument that the reasonableness of her actions should have also been considered in light of what she contends is “her substantial girth and probable physical unfitness.” However, due to the fact that such an argument was not raised at any point before the trial court, it has not been preserved for appellate review. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008) (“This Court’s well-settled raise-or-waive rule precludes us from considering at the appellate level issues not properly presented before the trial court.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011) (“This Court staunchly adheres to the raise or waive rule, which requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 19 - the door in order to get inside Mr. Cornish’s room, one could assume that defendant was unable to get out of Mr. Cornish’s room, but the evidence presented at trial indicated otherwise. Although the trial justice stated that Ms. Roberts’s testimony may have suggested that the damage to the door hindered defendant’s ability to leave, it was also elicited at trial that both Mr. Cornish and Ms. Roberts were able to exit the room through the door after the stabbing and before the paramedics arrived.', 'C', 'The Defendant’s Challenge Is Unavailing', 'The defendant has failed to convince us that the trial justice did not “conscientiously apply” the requisite standard in ruling on her motion for a new trial. Guerra, 12 A.3d at 766 (internal quotation marks omitted). Before denying the defendant’s motion, the trial justice properly considered the evidence in light of the jury charge, thoroughly reviewed all of the facts adduced at trial in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and weighing the evidence, and ultimately stated that she was in accord with the jury’s verdict. It is evident that the trial justice employed the appropriate analytical approach and that she performed her role as the thirteenth juror carefully, articulating a more than adequate rationale for her decision. In light of the deferential standard that governs our review of a trial justice’s findings and conclusions in the context of a motion for a new trial, we are unable to conclude that the trial justice in this case was either clearly wrong or that she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence in her denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

The plaintiffs, the Chariho Regional School District and the Cranston School Department, appeal from an October 19, 2010 judgment of the Providence County Superior Court dismissing their complaint, pursuant to which the plaintiffs had sought a writ of mandamus. The plaintiffs contend that the hearing justice erred when, in applying Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, he granted the motions to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint; those motions had been filed by Deborah Gist, the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education of the State of Rhode Island (the Commissioner), and Frank T. Caprio, the then-General Treasurer of the State of Rhode Island (the Treasurer).1', 'They allege that the hearing justice erred in finding: (1) that the 1', 'Frank T. Caprio was General Treasurer of the State of Rhode Island when the complaint was filed, when the motions to dismiss were filed, and when the hearing justice granted the motions to dismiss. However, Gina Raimondo held the position of General Treasurer at the time when this appeal was filed, and she continues in that position. Accordingly, when we refer to “the Treasurer” in this opinion, we should be understood as referring to whichever of those individuals held the position of General Treasurer at the point in time in question. We further note that Deborah Gist, Gina Raimondo, and Frank T. Caprio were all sued only in their official capacities.', '-1- Commissioner’s decision to deny the plaintiffs reimbursement for certain employees’ salaries and benefits was discretionary in nature, rather than ministerial; and (2) that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel 2', 'This case began when plaintiffs commenced a proceeding before the Commissioner, seeking reimbursement to which they contend they are entitled pursuant to Section IV(A)(2) and Section IV(A)(3) of the Regulations of the Board of Regents Governing the Management and Operation of Area Vocational-Technical Centers in Rhode Island (the Regulations). Specifically, plaintiffs argued that, in accordance with the Regulations, they should be reimbursed for the “salary, fringe benefits, and travel expenses” of: (1) the directors of their vocational-technical programs; and (2) the guidance counselors working in their vocational- technical programs. The Commissioner granted the motion of the Department of Education to dismiss the action on the grounds that the Regulations were “trump[ed]” by G.L. 1956 § 16-7.1- 19, which created a vocational-technical equity fund.3 The plaintiffs timely appealed to the Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education (the Board of Regents).4 2', 'It should be noted that the facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute. 3', 'See Part II.C., infra, for a more detailed discussion of G.L. 1956 § 16-7.1-19. 4', 'The Board of Regents upheld the Commissioner’s granting of the Department of Education’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ action. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the Board of Regents; that appeal is pending. What is before us is only the complaint filed by plaintiffs seeking a writ of mandamus which would order that the funds to which plaintiffs posit they were entitled for the 2010 fiscal year be dispensed. We are not at this time addressing plaintiffs’ appeal to the Superior Court from the decision of the Board of Regents. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n. 4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not', '-2-', 'While that appeal was pending, on June 30, 2010 (the last day of the 2010 fiscal year), plaintiffs filed a complaint in Superior Court alleging that the Commissioner and the Treasurer were required to release the funds to which they claim they are entitled for reimbursement of certain costs associated with the operation of career and technical centers pursuant to the Regulations; they asked the court to compel the payment of the funds through issuance of a writ of mandamus.5', 'The Commissioner and the Treasurer each filed motions to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(c).6 The Commissioner argued that: (1) plaintiffs had no “clear legal opine” and stating that “we need not reach that issue at this time in order to decide the case before us”).', 'To the extent that it has been suggested that the Superior Court in this action did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the appropriate avenue for appealing from a decision of the Board of Regents is by petitioning this Court for a writ of certiorari, we find that argument to be meritless; this action was filed before the Board of Regents issued a decision and was presented by plaintiffs as an action for a writ of mandamus, not an appeal from the Board of Regents. The Superior Court has jurisdiction over an action seeking a writ of mandamus. See G.L. 1956 § 8-2- 16 (“The [S]uperior [C]ourt * * * concurrently with the [S]upreme [C]ourt shall have jurisdiction of writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto, and informations in the nature of quo warranto.”) (emphasis added); see also Higgins v. Tax Assessors of Pawtucket, 27 R.I. 401, 409- 11, 63 A. 34, 37-38 (1905). Therefore, there was subject matter jurisdiction in the instant case, regardless of whether or not there was a likelihood of plaintiffs prevailing. See generally Narragansett Electric Co. v. Saccoccio, 43 A.3d 40, 44 (R.I. 2012) (stating that “[t]he term subject matter jurisdiction, when properly used, refers only to the court’s power to hear and decide a case and not to whether a court having the power to adjudicate should exercise that power”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 5', 'The complaint confines itself merely to the funds that plaintiffs contend are due for the 2010 fiscal year; consequently, despite the fact that, in the proceeding before the Commissioner and the Board of Regents plaintiffs were seeking funds dating back to 1990, the case before us deals only with the funds relative to the 2010 fiscal year. 6', 'The Commissioner and the Treasurer titled their motions differently but both motions are clearly based on the same rule—namely, Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 12(c) reads in pertinent part as follows: “After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.”', '-3- entitlement” to the funds at issue; and (2) that the Commissioner had “no ministerial duty” to reimburse plaintiffs. The Treasurer argued: (1) that the General Treasurer lacked the capacity to reimburse plaintiffs without the authorization of the Commissioner; and (2) that plaintiffs failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to them. The hearing justice granted both motions. He stated that there was an adequate remedy at law available to plaintiffs in the form of the appeal from the decision of the Board of Regents. Moreover, he held that the “whole notion of computing funds and who should cut loose moneys is an act of discretion on the part of the administrative authorities at the Department of Education and ultimately with the State Treasury, it is not just something done by * * * a functionary sitting somewhere.” The plaintiffs appeal that decision.7', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'The plaintiffs appeal from a grant of defendants’ motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).

They further point out that the state, in its budget for the 2010 fiscal year, appropriated funds to the Department of Education and that the scope of that appropriation was broad enough to encompass funding the salaries and expenses of the directors and guidance counselors.', 'On the other hand, the Commissioner posits that construing the Regulations as plaintiffs do is “at odds” with the Board of Regents’ enabling legislation. The portion of the enabling legislation which is at issue reads:', '“In the preparation of the budget, the regents shall', 'determine priorities of expenditures for elementary and secondary', 'education purposes of state revenues and other public resources', 'made available for the support of public elementary and secondary', 'education among the various education agencies of the state.', 'Nothing contained in this section shall authorize any individual or', 'group of individuals to reallocate resources in a manner other than', 'that prescribed in the budget as appropriations by the general', 'assembly.” G.L. 1956 § 16-60-4(5)(ii).

Section 16-7.1-19(a) reads as follows:', '“The general assembly recognizes the need to support the', 'academic instruction component of vocational education for', 'students enrolled in career and technical education programs. To', 'accomplish this, the general assembly shall appropriate some sum', 'per student for each student who attends a locally operated career', 'and technical center based on the enrollments reported to the', 'department of elementary and secondary education for the', 'reference year as defined in § 16-7-16.

Section 16-45-7 reads as follows:', '“(a) The general assembly shall appropriate any sum as it', 'may deem necessary for the purpose of reducing local district area', 'vocational technical school tuition. All districts which send', 'students to state operated schools which are funded through the', 'operations aid formula shall not be entitled to receive funds under', 'this section for students attending those schools.', '“(b) Each year one hundred percent (100%) of the', 'approved regional vocational school expenditures for the reference', 'year is appropriated.

Finally, the Commissioner avers that the General Assembly in fact did appropriate funds to plaintiffs for vocational-technical education in the 2010 fiscal year, which funds, she contends, “exceeded the total amount of the School Departments’ claims.” (Emphasis in original.)', 'The plaintiffs respond by arguing that the creation of the vocational-technical equity fund did not render nugatory the Regulations because, wherever possible, statutes and regulations are to be harmonized. It is the contention of the plaintiffs that § 16-7.1-19 and the Regulations can “easily be read together.” They posit that § 16-7.1-19 makes an appropriation for the “academic instruction component of the vocational education” and that the Regulations provide for expenditures for the directors and guidance counselors; they conclude that “[o]ne does not preclude the other, and both can be given effect.”', 'Certainly plaintiffs’ contentions may have merit. The plaintiffs are correct that the Regulations represent legislative rules, because they were enacted by the Board of Regents pursuant to its enabling legislation and after a notice and comment procedure.', 'See Great American Nursing Centers, Inc. v. Norberg, 567 A.2d 354, 356-57 (R.I. 1989). Moreover, as we have recognized, legislative rules do have the “force and effect of law,” and the party challenging a legislative rule must rebut the “presumption of validity [which] attaches to [the] * * * rule.” Id. at 357; see also Henry v. Earhart, 553 A.2d 124, 126-27 n. 1 (R.I. 1989); Lerner v. Gill, 463 A.2d 1352, 1358 (R.I. 1983).

See State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'However, even if we treat plaintiffs’ contentions as being accurate and resolve any doubt in their favor, we are still confronted with the Commissioner’s arguments: (1) that construing the Regulations to require the Commissioner to pay the funds at issue is “at odds” with the Department of Education’s enabling legislation (as codified in § 16-60-4(5)(ii)); and (2) that the General Assembly’s enacting § 16-7.1-19 in 2000 (approximately ten years after the Regulations were enacted) changed the method of funding vocational-technical schools.

As such, the Commissioner’s contention that the Regulations are in conflict with the enabling legislation, like plaintiffs’ contentions, also seems to potentially have merit.', 'Moreover, with respect to the second argument of the Commissioner, we have repeatedly held that “[i]t is a basic tenet of administrative law that the rule-making power of an administrative body may not abrogate state law dealing with the same subject.” Reback v.', '- 11 - Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education, 560 A.2d 357, 358 (R.I. 1989); see also Town of Smithfield v.

In the instant case, § 16-7.1-19, which was enacted ten years after the Regulations, appears upon our review to alter the means by which the state funds vocational- technical education. Therefore, the Commissioner also has a potentially meritorious argument that the Regulations are “trump[ed]” by state statute.13 Town of Smithfield, 924 A.2d at 802; see also Ridgewood Homeowners Association v.

However, the Court’s concern in this opinion is not which party is correct as a matter of law but rather whether plaintiffs have a clear legal right.

Power Survey Company (Power Survey) was one of the vendors that responded to the RFP, but it was not ultimately selected by the NEC to perform the contact voltage testing.', 'Before this Court, Power Survey contends that the Commission “improperly interpreted and applied” the Contact Voltage Statute when it approved the just- discussed portion of the NEC’s contact voltage program—namely, the portion providing for the issuance of a RFP for the purpose of choosing a vendor to provide the technology for the NEC’s contact voltage testing.', 'At present, we are concerned only with the motions of the NEC and the Division to quash the writ of certiorari and not with the substantive merits of the case.

The Proposed Program specifically referenced the NEC’s intention to “issue a Request for Proposal * * * for mobile technology services for the contact voltage program.” According to the cover letter from the NEC attached to the Proposed Program, a proposed “pilot [test][5] designed to compare performance of vendor equipment when surveying comparable Company-designated contact voltage areas” was also included in the Proposed Program. The Division supported the proposed RFP, making particular reference to the pilot test, and it urged the NEC and the Commission to reject any vendors that refused to participate in the pilot test, stating:', '“To the extent a vendor refuses to participate is [sic] such a pilot', '[test] assessment, the [NEC] should consider that Vendor a non-', 'responsive bidder and proceed without consideration of that', 'Vendor’s system and process.”6 The NEC stated that, in following the Division’s recommendation, it would reject any vendors that refused to participate in the pilot test.', 'On October 2, 2012, the NEC submitted a revised version of its Proposed Program (Revised Program) to the Commission. Subsequently, on November 9, 2012, after receiving the 5', 'That just-mentioned “pilot test” is referred to in the record at various times as a pilot test, a pilot program, a pilot project, and a pilot survey. For the sake of clarity we will refer to it as a pilot test. 6', 'On September 18, 2012, the Division submitted a document entitled “Prefiled Direct Joint Testimony of Gregory L. Booth * * * and Michael W. White * * * .” The testimony in that document supported the pilot test and urged the NEC to disqualify any vendor who refused to participate.', '-5- Revised Program and other post-hearing submissions, the Commission issued a written order (the Process Order). As indicated in that order, the Commission: (1) found the RFP process to be a “reasonable approach to choosing a vendor” and approved the issuance of a RFP including the pilot test; (2) approved the use of a pilot test; (3) concluded that participation in the pilot test “should verify whether one vendor is superior to another;” (4) approved the decision to disqualify any vendor that refused to participate in that pilot testing; and (5) noted that the Commission “will not be choosing the vendor.” The Process Order contained language which informed “[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision or order of the Commission” that such a person had a right to “petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the legality and reasonableness of the decision or order.” Notably, Power Survey did not petition this Court for a writ of certiorari in order to challenge the Process Order.', 'The NEC issued a RFP on November 26, 2012. On December 17, 2012, the NEC filed a report of the results of the RFP with the Commission. Two potential vendors had responded to the RFP, one of which was Power Survey; however, it is undisputed that Power Survey expressly informed the NEC that it would not participate in the pilot test. Consequently, and in accordance with the Process Order and the Division’s recommendation, the NEC moved forward with the other vendor. The Division filed the only response to the NEC’s report, in which it endorsed the “RFP award recommendations” and stated that the NEC had complied with the Process Order.', 'In spite of the fact that it had not sought to intervene in the proceeding before the Commission, Power Survey filed public comment with the Commission alleging that the RFP and the pilot test were flawed. The NEC responded on January 24, 2013. On February 1, 2013, the Commission issued a written order (the Compliance Order) which noted: (1) that the NEC', '-6- had properly complied with the Process Order; and (2) that the Commission was “disappointed” with Power Survey’s actions with respect to the RFP process.', 'On February 8, 2013, Power Survey filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, purportedly attacking the Compliance Order. This Court issued a writ of certiorari on February 15, 2013. 7 On April 19, 2013 and April 26, 2013 respectively, the NEC and the Division filed motions to quash the February 15, 2013 writ of certiorari as having been improvidently granted, and it is those motions to quash with which we are concerned in this opinion.', 'II', 'Issue', 'We are called upon to decide whether or not Power Survey’s petition for a writ of certiorari, purportedly challenging the Compliance Order, is time-barred due to the fact that, as the Division and the NEC contend, Power Survey is actually challenging the Process Order and failed to bring that challenge within seven days of the issuance of the Process Order as is required by § 39-5-1.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'The NEC contends that it is “apparent from the substance of Power Survey’s petition and memorandum * * * that Power Survey is challenging the Commission’s Process Order” rather than the Compliance Order which Power Survey claims to be challenging. The NEC argues that it is clear that the Process Order and not the Compliance Order is actually being challenged because it was the Process Order that explicitly approved the disqualification of vendors that refused to participate in the pilot testing and, as such, “Power Survey cannot be a successful 7', 'It is significant that the instant case involves a statutory writ of certiorari (see § 39-5-1) and not a common law writ of certiorari.', '-7- vendor unless it reverses the Process Order.” The NEC further contends that it is “well-settled” that only the most recent order may be considered in a case in which a statutory petition for a writ of certiorari has been filed; it posits that any topic relating to earlier unappealed orders is not properly before the Court on a petition for a writ of certiorari involving a challenge to a later order. Consequently, the NEC avers that Power Survey’s “deliberate decision to sit on the periphery of the proceedings before the Commission and not intervene in those proceedings or challenge the [Process Order] approving the request for proposals process,” dooms its petition for a writ of certiorari since it should have challenged the Process Order—which it uncontestably failed to do.', 'The Division, in its statement filed before this Court entitled “Division’s Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion to Quash Writ of Certiorari,” largely echoes the just-summarized arguments of the NEC.', 'In contrast, Power Survey contends that it is challenging the Compliance Order and, consequently, that, its petition was in fact timely.8 Power Survey posits that the issues it raised during the public comments period before the Commission are addressed in the Compliance Order.', 'It further posits that the Compliance Order did not merely confirm that the NEC complied with the Process Order; it also approved the NEC’s selection of a vendor that, according to Power Survey, had problems with its equipment and produced hundreds of false positives. Additionally, Power Survey notes that, at the time the Process Order was issued, the 8', 'Power Survey makes an initial argument that the Division chose not to object to the petition for a writ of certiorari until after the writ of certiorari was issued and that, consequently, any arguments it makes now in support of its motion to quash have been waived. This argument is unavailing. Power Survey’s petition is stamped February 8, 2013. The Division’s memorandum in support of its objection to the petition was filed on February 20, 2013. Article I, Rule 13(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure requires a memorandum in opposition to a petition to be filed within twenty days after service of the petition. Since the Division could not possibly have been served before the petition was filed on February 8, contrary to the contention of Power Survey, the Division’s objection was timely.', '-8- RFP “had not been issued by [the NEC], no bidder’s conference had been held thereunder, all of the criteria to be used for selection of a vendor had not been disclosed to potential vendors, and Power Survey had not been disqualified from anything.” Thus, it argues that the Process Order merely approved disqualification of vendors in the future if they chose not to participate in the pilot testing and that, therefore, it was not until the Compliance Order was issued that Power Survey was actually disqualified; in other words, Power Survey argues that it was only potentially disqualified when the Process Order was issued, and, consequently, it had nothing to challenge at that time. Our analysis, therefore, revolves around the question of whether or not Power Survey was, in a legal sense, aggrieved by the Process Order.', 'Section 39-5-1 requires anyone “aggrieved by a decision or order of the commission” to “within seven * * * days from the date of the decision or order, petition the supreme court for a writ of certiorari * * * .” (Emphasis added.) The General Assembly has characterized § 39-5-1 “as the exclusive appellate remedy” for review of decisions or orders of the Commission. Providence Gas Co. v. Burman, 119 R.I. 78, 84, 376 A.2d 687, 691 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, we have repeatedly stated that “[t]he period for filing a statutory petition for certiorari under § 39-5-1 cannot be extended.” United States v.

Therefore, if a party fails to meet the seven day requirement, it renders the “findings of the commission nonreviewable,” and this Court will dismiss that party’s petition for a writ of certiorari.', 'Public Utilities Commission of Rhode Island, 635 A.2d at 1138; see, e.g., Interstate Navigation Co. v. Burke, 465 A.2d 750, 755 (R.I. 1983); Roberts v. Blackstone Valley Electric Co., 423 A.2d 1194, 1194 (R.I. 1980) (mem.).', '-9-', 'Thus, our case law makes it clear that, if we determine that Power Survey is challenging the substance of the Process Order, rather than the Compliance Order, then this Court should grant the motions by the NEC and the Division to quash the writ of certiorari on the ground that Power Survey’s petition for a writ of certiorari was not timely. See Interstate Navigation Co., 465 A.2d at 752, 754-55 (dismissing a petition for a writ of certiorari where the Commission had issued two orders, but a petition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed only with relation to the second order and stating that the first order had become “nonreviewable”); Eastern Communications Corp. v. Burman, 121 R.I. 311, 315, 397 A.2d 1317, 1319 (1979) (noting that Eastern Communications Corporation claimed to challenge a November 4, 1976 order of the Commission but then determining that its “true target” was a September 13, 1976 order—with respect to which it had failed to file a timely petition for a writ of certiorari). However, if we determine that Power Survey is challenging the substance of the Compliance Order, then its petition was timely since it was filed within seven days of the issuance of the Compliance Order, and we should deny the motions to quash. Accordingly, we proceed to take a closer look at the Process Order, the Compliance Order, and Power Survey’s petition for a writ of certiorari.', 'The Process Order is thirty-two pages long and begins with a comprehensive discussion of the facts and evidence confronting the Commission; it details the testimony presented to the Commission with respect to the NEC’s Proposed Program and the post-hearing submissions by the parties. Ultimately, it reflects the decision of the Commission to approve the revised version of the Proposed Program submitted by the NEC, including the RFP. The Commission’s Process Order states in pertinent part as follows:', '“The vendor/tester using the mobile technology and associated', 'equipment will be chosen through a proposed RFP.', '“The Commission finds that [the NEC’s] RFP Process', 'represents a reasonable approach to choosing a vendor. The', '- 10 -', 'Commission specifically approves the use of a pilot [test] as', 'described at the hearing in this docket. The Division indicated that', 'the pilot survey was a common approach and further recommended', 'that if a bidder did not participate in a pilot testing under the RFP', 'that it be disqualified. The Commission agrees. When public', 'dollars are expended and there is a possibility of competition in the', 'arena, there must be a fair process by which the vendor is', 'chosen. * * * A pilot survey should verify whether one vendor is', 'superior to another and should be factored into the decision.”', '(Emphasis added.) In the Process Order, the Commission also explicitly states that “it w[ould] not be choosing the vendor.” The Compliance Order, on the other hand, is only ten pages long. The Commission reviewed therein what it had said in the Process Order and addressed the NEC’s report which summarized the results of the pilot test and identified the NEC’s chosen vendor.', 'The Compliance Order proceeds to address Power Survey’s arguments with respect to the RFP and the pilot test, which the Commission received as public comment.', 'Most importantly, the Commission found that the NEC “had complied with the RFP Process approved by the Commission in [the Process Order].” It went on to state as follows:', '“The Commission is deeply disappointed and rather perplexed with', 'Power Survey’s actions in this docket and in the RFP process. If', 'Power Survey truly believes it has a superior product, truly has', 'public safety in mind, and is interested in more than creating a', 'monopoly for itself in the arena of contact voltage mobile testing,', 'it should have had no hesitation about participating in a controlled', 'pilot test. * * * [It] begs the question of why [Power Survey] chose', 'to simply attack the other parties to the process rather than', 'participate in the pilot and seek to establish its superiority through', 'facts rather than conjecture. A bidder to an RFP should not be able', 'to void a pilot, and therefore, an entire RFP, simply by taking its', 'ball and going home and then arguing that if it had stayed, it would', 'have won the game.”9 9', 'In its statement entitled “Power Survey Company’s Objection to National Grid’s Motion to Quash Writ of Certiorari,” Power Survey briefly raises a contention that it was injured by the Compliance Order because “the outlandish dictum contained in the [Commission’s Compliance] Order harmed Power Survey’s professional reputation.” While this contention, as opposed to Power Survey’s other contentions, does arise out of the Compliance Order, it was not raised in', '- 11 - The Compliance Order concluded by stating:', '“At this point, all Power Survey can hope to gain through this', 'protracted public comment is to delay the implementation of an', 'important public safety program. That, the Commission will not', 'do.”', 'Having established what issues the Commission addressed in both the Process Order and the Compliance Order we turn now to Power Survey’s petition for a writ of certiorari. In its petition, Power Survey asserted: “[T]he program proposed by [the NEC] did not contain ‘appropriate procedures’ to accomplish the Legislature’s express requirements and intent, and was unreasonably geared toward selection of a vendor that would not detect the actual number of risks of electrocution and shocks from [the NEC’s] facilities. Accordingly, [the Compliance Order] approving the [RFP and the pilot test] is unlawful and unreasonable and must be vacated.”10 Power Survey further contended that the Commission’s approval of the NEC’s RFP process and the results thereof was based on its acceptance of the NEC’s attempt to select the lowest cost vendor, not the best technology available. In its petition, Power Survey remarked that, in the Compliance Order, “the Commission confirmed its position that [the] RFP process [was] a reasonable approach * * * .” Power Survey additionally stated: “With regard to the selection of mobile testing equipment the Commission ignored the recommendations of expert Power Survey’s petition for a writ of certiorari and does not address any actual error by the Commission. Accordingly, we shall consider it no further. See Navieros Inter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express, 120 F.3d 304, 316 (1st Cir. 1997) (“It is a basic principle of appellate jurisdiction that we review judgments, not the editorial commentary in opinions.”) (emphasis in original). 10', 'Power Survey also claimed the RFP process was “severely flawed” and had “resulted in the acceptance of a [contact voltage] detection system that clearly [did] not meet the [Contact Voltage Statute’s] requirements.”', '- 12 - witnesses that the overall accuracy of mobile scans be evaluated, and approved the use of a vendor selection process where accuracy was secondary to other considerations.”', 'It is abundantly clear to us that, despite Power Survey’s contention that it is challenging the Compliance Order, it is in reality challenging the Process Order.11 It was the Process Order which approved the RFP process and the pilot test. The Compliance Order merely, in the words of Power Survey itself, “confirmed [the Commission’s] position * * * that [the] RFP process [was] a reasonable approach * * * .”', '(Emphasis added.)', 'Moreover, Power Survey has contended that the Commission in the Compliance Order “ignored the recommendations of expert witnesses” and “approved the use of a vendor selection process where accuracy was secondary to other considerations.” However, this contention flies in the face of the fact that it was the Process Order which discussed, at length, the testimony of expert witnesses and which ultimately approved the use of the pilot test. It is the Process Order’s requirement that there be a pilot test (in which test Power Survey unequivocally refused to participate) that eventuated in Power Survey’s inevitable and entirely foreseeable disqualification. Despite the fact that Power Survey had not yet been formally disqualified when the Process Order was issued, it was the requirement of participating in the pilot test which led directly to Power Survey being formally disqualified; our careful review of the record discloses that the details of the RFP and the pilot test, including the provision regarding the disqualification of any vendors that refused to participate in the pilot test, were articulated and approved by the Commission in the Process Order, not in the Compliance Order. Power Survey is essentially trying to challenge the Process 11', 'We are not persuaded by Power Survey’s argument that, because it attached the Compliance Order to its petition for a writ of certiorari, it was clearly challenging that order, not the Process Order. See State v. Keenan, 68 A.3d 588, 593 n. 4 (R.I. 2013) (noting that this Court has “repeatedly refused” to “elevate form over substance”); see also New Harbor Village, LLC v. Town of New Shoreham Zoning Board of Review, 894 A.2d 901, 905 (R.I. 2006); Sarni v. Meloccaro, 113 R.I. 630, 636, 324 A.2d 648, 651 (1974).', '- 13 - Order through the Compliance Order because it decided not to participate in the pilot test and was, thus, disqualified. However, as is true for all petitioning parties, Power Survey was subject to the requirements of § 39-5-1; in order to challenge the Process Order, it had to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court within seven days. It failed to do so. Accordingly, the Process Order is unreviewable, and we grant the motions filed by the NEC and the Division to quash the statutory writ of certiorari which we issued on February 15, 2013.', 'Power Survey argues that, even if it is determined that it is the Process Order that is actually being challenged, its statutory petition for a writ of certiorari should be treated by this Court as a petition for a common law writ of certiorari; Power Survey further avers that this Court should grant the petition for a common law writ of certiorari due to the “substantial public interest” in adopting adequate procedures to prevent electrocutions.12 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We have held that “[t]his [C]ourt * * * has exclusive jurisdiction to issue a common- law writ of certiorari on occasions in which available remedies are inadequate to safeguard a litigant from substantial harm or injustice.” Public Utilities Commission of Rhode Island, 635 A.2d at 1138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, we “will not issue common law certiorari where the petitioner has failed to utilize another available adequate remedy,” Providence Gas Co., 119 R.I. at 84, 376 A.2d at 691, unless “it is shown that unusual hardship or exceptional circumstances would void the benefits of an otherwise adequate remedy at law.” Public Utilities Commission of Rhode Island, 635 A.2d at 1138; see also Providence Water Supply Board, 708 A.2d at 542. We consider § 39-5-1 to be an adequate remedy at law. Eastern Communications Corp., 121 R.I. at 315, 397 A.2d at 1319; see also Public Utilities Commission 12', 'We note that Power Survey fails to cite to any authority in support of its contention that this Court should convert its petition for a statutory writ of certiorari into a petition for a common law writ of certiorari.', '- 14 - of Rhode Island, 635 A.2d at 1138. Thus, after the Process Order was issued, Power Survey had an available remedy in that it could have petitioned for a statutory writ of certiorari in this Court within seven days of the Process Order pursuant to § 39-5-1; it chose not to do so. After a thorough review of the record we perceive no evidence of an “unusual hardship or exceptional circumstance[]” which would warrant the granting of a petition for a common law writ of certiorari. Public Utilities Commission of Rhode Island, 635 A.2d at 1138.13 Thus, we decline Power Survey’s invitation to treat its statutory petition for a writ of certiorari as a petition for a common law writ of certiorari; and we hold that, even if we were to treat the statutory petition as a petition for a common law writ of certiorari, such a petition would be denied.', 'In conclusion, we hold that, despite the fact that Power Survey contends that it is challenging only the Compliance Order, it is clear from our review of the record that Power Survey’s true target is the Process Order; and, because Power Survey failed to petition this Court for a writ of certiorari within seven days of the issuance of the Process Order, as required in § 39-5-1, Power Survey’s petition is untimely. We further hold that Power Survey has not satisfied the criteria for the granting of a common law writ of certiorari. 13', 'Power Survey contends that the NEC may not challenge the issuance of the writ of certiorari because it was not injured and, thus, is not an aggrieved party. We once again note that Power Survey does not cite a single legal authority in support of its argument. The NEC responds that it is clearly a party to these proceedings regardless of whether it was harmed, and it notes that it is the only party involved who is compelled to take any action as a result of the Commission’s orders. It points to the fact that § 39-5-2 instructs the clerk that, after a writ of certiorari issues, he or she “shall issue citations to all parties in interest,” which would include the NEC. We are in agreement with the NEC that it has standing to move to quash.', 'The NEC and the Division raise several arguments in support of their motions to quash in addition to those which we have discussed.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This dispute concerns title to ninety-four acres of land located at 47 Cucumber Hill Road in Foster, Rhode Island, which was transferred by quitclaim deed to the plaintiff trust by Joseph P. Notarianni,4 the patriarch of the family, before his death on February 26, 2009. This case began with a complaint for eviction for unlawfully holding over after the termination of tenancy, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-18-38(a), filed by the plaintiff trust in District Court against defendants. (With the possible exception of Christine Fink, defendants are siblings and are children of Joseph Sr.)5', 'The instrument that created the plaintiff trust required the trustee, upon the death of the settlor, to distribute a fifteen-acre tract of land, which included Joseph Sr.’s personal residence at 47 Cucumber Hill Road, to Stephen P.

The defendants timely appealed to the Superior Court on June 15, 2009, and they filed a motion to dismiss the case. The defendants argued that the plaintiff trust was not a landlord and that defendants were not tenants; they contended that they were, instead, tenants in common with Stephen P. Notarianni (the trustee)—and that, therefore, an action for eviction could not lie.6 The Superior Court subsequently issued an order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss because, in the view of the motion justice, the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case and the plaintiff trust lacked standing.7 The plaintiff trust filed a notice of appeal to this Court on the same day that the order was entered—viz., October 27, 2009.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'Despite the fact that this rather internecine litigation has already occupied the attention of four courts in this state,8 we are at this time concerned only with the limited question of whether 6', 'In addition, defendants contest the validity of the trust; they claim that the ninety-four acres located at 47 Cucumber Hill Road were part of Joseph Sr.’s estate and should be distributed in accordance with the terms governing distribution of Joseph Sr.’s estate.', 'In its statement filed pursuant to Article I, Rule 12(A) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, the plaintiff trust asserts that at least some of defendants were residing in the structure at 47 Cucumber Hill Road and that it had to remove the “tenants” in order to prepare the property for sale. 7', 'The terms of the order issued by the Superior Court on October 27, 2009 were ultimately included in the document entitled “FINAL JUDGMENT,” which was signed by the motion justice on December 6, 2012.

The state appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting the defendant’s motions to suppress and/or exclude evidence obtained by Pawtucket police detectives following the defendant’s arrest in the city of Providence. The defendant Steven B. Morris (Morris or defendant) was indicted for two separate incidents of first-degree robbery committed in Pawtucket in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a). On appeal, the state argues that the hearing justice erred in deciding that evidence stemming from an extra- jurisdictional arrest was subject to the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this matter are largely undisputed. The first of the two robberies with which defendant was charged occurred on September 6, 2010 when Alcides Dias, an assistant manager', '-1- at PCX Clothing Store in Pawtucket, was robbed at knifepoint. 1 Detective David Silva of the Pawtucket Police Department testified that Dias described the robber as being a “black male in his forties, or late thirties, * * * heavyset, stocky,” and wearing a red hat, white shirt, black and blue shorts, and black gloves with the tips cut off. A few days later, on September 9, 2010, the Save-a-Lot grocery store in Pawtucket was also robbed at knifepoint. Nicole Cookson, the victim in that robbery, described the robber as being “a black male, forties, stocky build, Hawaiian shirt, yellow hat, running shorts[.]” Two other witnesses said that the robber fled the store in a black Mercedes Benz with a temporary license plate in the rear window of the car. The witnesses also said that the license plate contained the numbers 1367 or 1376. Detectives Silva and Donti Rosciti of the Pawtucket Police Department reviewed the surveillance footage from both robberies and, based on the videos, formed a belief that the person who had robbed the PCX had also committed the Save-a-Lot robbery. They then sent an email to all other police officers in the department with the description of the getaway vehicle.', 'The following day, Officer Mark Ramos identified a car matching that description parked outside of 327 Sayles Avenue in Pawtucket.', 'Officer Ramos notified the detectives and discovered, on speaking to one of the residents, that the car belonged to “a black male * * * who lived on the third floor.” Detective Silva used the vehicle identification number of the car and was informed by the dealer at Class Act Auto Sales that the car had been sold to Morris. Officer Ramos and the detectives then went to the third floor of the building and received the consent of the resident to search the apartment. The resident of the apartment confirmed that Morris sometimes stayed overnight as a guest and directed the police to a storage room in the apartment 1', 'The facts in this section are taken from the testimony of the detectives and other witnesses who testified at the hearing.', '-2- where defendant kept some of his belongings. The police seized clothing and an Allstate insurance policy in defendant’s name for the Mercedes.', 'Detective Silva obtained defendant’s phone number and called him, explaining that his vehicle had been seen leaving the scene of a robbery. The defendant identified the vehicle by asking, “My Mercedes?” Detective Silva told defendant that the detectives needed to speak with him. Although defendant offered to take a bus to the Pawtucket police station, he was eventually convinced by Det. Silva that he be picked up at Crossroads 2 in Providence.', 'On arriving at Crossroads, the detectives saw defendant and recognized him as the person whom they had observed in the surveillance footage from both robberies.', 'After a brief conversation with defendant in which he agreed to accompany the detectives to the police station, Det. Rosciti performed a pat-down search of him. Detective Rosciti testified that the pat- down looking for weapons was standard procedure before any civilian is permitted to enter a police vehicle. On performing the pat-down, Det. Rosciti felt something like paper or plastic in one of defendant’s pockets and removed it. The piece of paper that Det. Rosciti took from defendant’s pocket was later identified as being a U-Haul rental truck receipt. Detective Rosciti testified that he took it out because he believed it might be contraband, such as a small packet of heroin or marijuana.', 'Morris was taken to the Pawtucket police station in the detectives’ car. Morris was not handcuffed while in the car. After arriving at the Pawtucket police station, defendant reviewed and initialed a Miranda rights waiver form. The detectives asked defendant where he had been the previous day, September 9, 2010, and defendant answered that he had been helping his sister move from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and had rented a U-Haul truck for that purpose. It was at that point 2', 'Crossroads is a facility, located on Broad Street in Providence, that offers shelter and other life services for the homeless.', '-3- that the detectives looked at the U-Haul receipt that had been seized from defendant’s person during the pat-down search. Detective Rosciti also spoke to Vivian Morris, defendant’s sister, who told him that defendant had called suddenly on September 9, between 1 and 1:30 p.m., and told her that he was going to move her that day. Following the conversation with Vivian Morris, the detectives then went to the U-Haul franchise in Pawtucket and reviewed the surveillance footage there. This footage showed defendant wearing what appeared to be the same clothing that the suspect in the Save-a-Lot robbery had been wearing.', 'The defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree robbery for the two armed robberies. The defendant filed a number of pretrial motions, including a motion to sever the charges pursuant to Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as several motions to suppress (1) certain clothing and paperwork found in the apartment on Sayles Avenue in Pawtucket, (2) the U-Haul receipt seized from defendant’s person, (3) photographs taken from the surveillance video from the U-Haul franchise in Pawtucket, (4) the statements defendant made to the Pawtucket police, and (5) the testimony of defendant’s sister, Vivian Morris.', 'The pretrial motions were heard in the Providence County Superior Court on February 23, 24, and 27, 2012. The hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to sever the charges, and the state elected to proceed first on the charge involving the Save-a-Lot robbery. 3 After hearing testimony and argument, the hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to suppress the U-Haul receipt, concluding that defendant was under arrest from the moment of the pat-down procedure and that “the arrest was illegal because it was outside [the] jurisdiction [of the detectives].” The hearing justice also granted defendant’s motions to suppress defendant’s statement to the 3', 'The motion to sever is not an issue before this Court.', '-4- Pawtucket police, the testimony of defendant’s sister, and the U-Haul surveillance video photographs as “fruits of the poisonous tree” stemming from defendant’s unauthorized arrest. 4 The hearing justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress the clothing and paperwork seized from the apartment on Sayles Avenue. 5', 'The state timely filed a notice to appeal the hearing justice’s granting of defendant’s various motions to suppress evidence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-32. 6', 'A final order memorializing the hearing justice’s decisions on defendant’s motions to dismiss was entered on May 14, 2012. 7', 'Additional facts will be supplied as necessary to address the issues on appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing the grant or denial of a motion to suppress, this Court accords deference to the trial justice’s factual findings and accepts those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.

State, 56 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2012).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, the state contends that even though defendant’s arrest was made outside the Pawtucket police officers’ jurisdictional authority, 8 the hearing justice erred in applying the Fourth Amendment 9 exclusionary rule to suppress the evidence obtained from the arrest. The state bases its argument on the United States Supreme Court opinion in Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 178 (2008), in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment “does not require the exclusion of evidence obtained from a constitutionally permissible arrest.” The state contends that the police officers’ actions were reasonable and that consequently, the exclusionary rule is too extreme a remedy under the facts of this case. In contrast, defendant argues that application of the exclusionary rule is the appropriate remedy for a violation of state law and that the circumstances of the instant case did not otherwise justify the detectives’ failure to respect the jurisdictional boundaries of their authority.', 'A', 'The Authority of the Pawtucket Police Officers', 'This Court has repeatedly held to the principle that “[i]n the absence of a statutory or judicially recognized exception, the authority of a local police department is limited to its own jurisdiction.” State v.

Staples, 13 R.I. 306 8', 'The state concedes for the purposes of this appeal that defendant was placed under arrest from the moment of the pat-down search. Accordingly, the question of whether defendant was actually under arrest before he was taken to the Pawtucket police station is not before this Court. 9', 'The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states, in pertinent part, that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated * * *.”', '-6- (1881)). 10 The General Assembly has established two exceptions to this rule. The first, known as the “hot pursuit” exception, permits police officers who are in “close pursuit” of a person to cross into another jurisdiction in order to arrest that person.', 'See G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19. 11 “Second, in emergency situations, it may be necessary and appropriate for the police from one jurisdiction to exercise authority in another jurisdiction.” Ceraso, 812 A.2d at 833; see also G.L. 1956 § 45-42-1 (granting officers responding to a request for “emergency police assistance from another police department * * * the same authority, powers, duties, privileges, and immunities as a duly appointed police officer of the city or town making the request”).

Consequently, he concluded that the arrest, although based on probable cause, was unauthorized as a violation of the detectives’ jurisdictional authority.', 'We agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that neither of the statutory exceptions applies to the case at bar. Detectives Rosciti and Silva were not in hot pursuit of defendant nor were they in Providence at the Providence Police Department’s request.', 'The defendant contends that the detectives had probable cause to arrest him before they arrived at Crossroads and that the detectives had, consequently, traveled to Providence with the specific intention of doing so. We disagree with defendant’s contention. We have held that “[p]robable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person’s belief that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested has committed the crime.” Musterd, 56 A.3d at 936 (quoting State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178, 1182 (R.I. 1999)). We are of the opinion that probable cause for defendant’s arrest did not arise until the detectives arrived at Crossroads and visually identified him as the person they had seen in the surveillance videos of the robberies. Until the detectives matched defendant with the perpetrator of the robberies in the videos, they knew only that defendant was the owner of a car that appeared to match the one used at the Save-a-Lot robbery. Accordingly, we cannot agree with defendant’s contention that the detectives crossed the boundary into Providence with the intent to arrest him. We give credence to Det. Silva’s testimony at the hearing that, at the time, they intended only to transport defendant to the Pawtucket police station to question him about the involvement of defendant’s Mercedes in the robberies.', '-8-', 'The defendant further argues that the Pawtucket detectives should have called the Providence police before they entered Providence. We disagree with defendant’s argument and find our recent opinion in Hagan to be informative. In Hagan, Portsmouth police, having lawfully arrested the defendant in their jurisdiction, drove him to Middletown in order to conduct a Breathalyzer test after discovering that the machine in Portsmouth was malfunctioning. See Hagan, 819 A.2d at 1257. There, we distinguished between the “arrest and seizure of a suspect outside a municipality’s borders * * * and the extraterritorial transport of a prisoner who is in lawful custody, for the performance of legitimate law enforcement duties * * *.” Id. at 1261. We “acknowledge[d] the practical realities of police investigations into unlawful conduct” in holding that “[a] police officer may take a prisoner already in lawful custody to another municipality to carry out legitimate law enforcement duties.” Id. Similarly, in the case at bar, we are satisfied that the Pawtucket police could properly travel outside of their jurisdiction without the accompaniment of Providence police in the course of investigating the robberies. We find no fault with the Pawtucket detectives’ behavior until they arrived at Crossroads.', 'We acknowledge that once the Pawtucket detectives arrived at Crossroads and made their visual identification of defendant as the perpetrator of the robberies, their actions did not follow the mandates for proper law enforcement activities outside of their jurisdiction. The state argues that, upon identifying defendant, the detectives were then justified in immediately arresting him to prevent defendant from “abscond[ing], perhaps to commit a third violent crime before recapture[.]” We do not agree with the state’s argument. Indeed, we find it implausible based on the facts of the case at bar. The defendant’s meeting the detectives at Crossroads and his cooperation with the detectives when they arrived do not indicate to this Court that defendant was a threat to flee from the police. We note that, if defendant had been inclined to flee, he', '-9- would hardly have been waiting at Crossroads to be questioned by the detectives at all. While the detectives may well not have expected defendant to appear, we deem it unreasonable to believe that he presented a risk of flight, once they saw that defendant had, in fact, met them at Crossroads. 13 Accordingly, we are satisfied that, from the moment the detectives arrived at Crossroads and determined they had probable cause to make an arrest, our jurisprudence required that they contact the Providence police department to ask for its assistance in arresting defendant. It was undisputed that Crossroads is located close to the Providence police station. Under the circumstances, we do not believe that requiring the Pawtucket detectives to contact the Providence police in order to make the arrest would have placed an unreasonable burden on them.', 'We emphasize that there is nothing in the record to indicate that contacting the Providence police and then waiting for their assistance would have required unlawfully detaining defendant for any length of time but rather could have been done in a matter of minutes. “[W]e are cognizant of the strong public interest underlying jurisdictional restraints over law enforcement personnel and are mindful that the Legislature has granted limited authority to an officer to arrest a suspect outside his or her jurisdiction * * *.” Hagan, 819 A.2d at 1261. Under the circumstances presented here, we decline to expand the authority which the Legislature has granted to a police officer to arrest a suspect outside of his or her jurisdiction. Consequently, we hold that the Pawtucket detectives’ actions in arresting defendant outside their jurisdiction without even attempting to get the assistance and approval of the Providence police were unauthorized and in excess of their authority. 13', 'We find a belief that defendant posed a risk of flight to be especially unreasonable under the circumstances as defendant was, to the best of the detectives’ knowledge, without the use of a car. We note that defendant had previously offered to take the bus to the Pawtucket police station.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'The Appropriate Remedy for Defendant’s Unauthorized Arrest', 'Our analysis, however, must continue on to determine whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates the exclusion of evidence obtained from defendant’s extra-jurisdictional arrest. The state argues that application of “the exclusionary rule is too harsh a remedy for any violation of a state jurisdictional statute” where, as here, the police officers “act[ed] in good-faith furtherance of their duty to protect the public[.]”', 'It is axiomatic that “[t]he exclusionary rule bars from introduction at trial evidence obtained either during or as a direct result of searches and seizures in violation of an individual’s Fourth Amendment rights.” State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983). This prohibition against the use of evidence obtained after an illegal search applies with equal force against the use of evidence obtained from an unlawful arrest. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485 (1963).', 'The exclusionary rule operates as “a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.” United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974). “[W]hether the exclusionary rule’s remedy is appropriate in a particular context * * * [is] an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 223 (1983). The United States Supreme Court has warned that “unbending application of the exclusionary sanction to enforce ideals of governmental rectitude would impede unacceptably the truth- finding functions of judge and jury.” United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 734 (1980). It is with these general principles in mind that we will consider whether the evidence obtained as a result of defendant’s unauthorized arrest must be suppressed.', '- 11 -', 'The United States Supreme Court has recently addressed the question of whether the Fourth Amendment requires that evidence obtained from a search made incident to an arrest that was unlawful under state law be excluded. See Moore, 553 U.S. at 177-78. Moore involved an arrest for the misdemeanor of driving on a suspended license, which under Virginia law was not an arrestable offense. Id. at 167. The Supreme Court concluded that “the arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone” and “it is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law.” 14 Id. at 178. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment did not require the exclusion of the evidence because of a violation of a state law where the arrest was otherwise “constitutionally permissible” under the federal constitution. Id.', 'More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has addressed the issue of whether evidence obtained after an arrest made outside of a federal law enforcement officer’s jurisdiction is inadmissible for that reason. See United States v. Ryan, 731 F.3d 66, 67 (1st Cir. 2013). In Ryan, a United States Park Ranger saw the defendant driving over the center line of the road and after following the defendant, pulled him over for the traffic violation, at which time the Ranger determined that the defendant was intoxicated. 15 Id. The traffic stop and the defendant’s subsequent arrest occurred outside of the National Park System and, therefore, outside of the federal statutory jurisdiction of the Ranger. Id. at 67-68. The First Circuit cited Moore in noting that, generally, federal constitutional claims have not been based on violations 14', 'The United States Supreme Court specifically noted that “Virginia law does not, as a general matter, require suppression of evidence obtained in violation of state law.” Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 167 (2008). The Supreme Court’s analysis, therefore, was limited to the question of whether suppression was required under the federal constitution. Id. at 168. 15', 'The federal statute limiting the jurisdiction of the Ranger included an exception for when a person flees to avoid arrest. See United States v. Ryan, 731 F.3d 66, 68 n.2 (1st Cir. 2013). In Ryan, however, there was no claim that the defendant was fleeing and so this exception was deemed to be inapplicable. Id.', '- 12 - of state or federal statutes concerning arrest. See id. at 69. The court concluded that “an officer * * * arrest[ing] an obviously intoxicated driver just outside that officer’s territorial jurisdiction, after a lawful traffic stop, is ‘not remotely’ akin to the invasions of privacy that might call for the exclusion of evidence [under the Fourth Amendment].” Id. at 70.', 'Here, there is no question that defendant’s arrest, although extra-jurisdictional, involves only a violation of state law and not of defendant’s constitutional rights. As a general matter, “the lawfulness of a state arrest by state police is governed by state law so long as that law is not inconsistent with federal constitutional standards.” State v. Berker, 120 R.I. 849, 855, 391 A.2d 107, 111 (1978). This Court has further concluded that a warrantless arrest made under our state statutes is “constitutionally sound * * * to the extent that it meets the requirement of probable cause[.]” Id. at 856, 391 A.2d at 111; cf. Ryan, 731 F.3d at 70 (noting that Moore “implies that an extraterritorial arrest is not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment”). Our primary concern here is, therefore, with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule for an arrest, based on probable cause, that was made outside the territorial jurisdiction of the arresting officer. We hold, in conjunction with the United States Supreme Court and the First Circuit, that the Fourth Amendment does not mandate exclusion of evidence obtained after defendant’s arrest outside of the Pawtucket detectives’ jurisdiction.', 'Although the arrest here was in excess of the officers’ jurisdiction, the Fourth Amendment does not impose some hypothetical ideal of a law enforcement officer’s conduct, but rather is concerned with whether the officer’s conduct was “reasonable” under the circumstances. See State v. Taveras, 39 A.3d 638, 648 (R.I. 2012) (“The lynchpin of any Fourth Amendment analysis is reasonableness.”); see also State v. Johnson, 102 R.I. 344, 351, 352, 353, 230 A.2d 831, 835, 836 (1967) (stating that “standards of reasonableness under the Fourth', '- 13 - Amendment are not susceptible of Procrustean application” and that a court “should measure the totality of circumstances against the constitutional standard of reasonableness” and be mindful of the fact that “a law enforcement officer * * * must act on a quick appraisal of the facts before him without the benefit of the hindsight which is usually possessed by those reviewing his actions”). This Court has stated that the exercise of our supervisory power to interpret and apply the exclusionary rule “should be exercised with great restraint after balancing carefully the societal interests involved.” State v. Jackson, 570 A.2d 1115, 1117 (R.I. 1990). We are of the opinion that the detectives’ actions in the case at bar do not constitute egregious conduct in excess of their jurisdiction. Accordingly, we conclude that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment does not apply here to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of defendant’s unauthorized arrest. 16', 'The defendant urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Hernandez, 924 N.E.2d 709 (Mass. 2010). In Hernandez, the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the suppression of evidence obtained after Boston University campus police had arrested the defendant without the statutory authority to do so. See id. at 710- 11. The Supreme Judicial Court addressed the holding in Moore, but concluded that past precedents of that court had established that suppression was appropriate because “exclusion is a deterrent to the abuse of official power based on the application of State legal principles.” Id. at 16', 'The defendant asserts that this Court has previously applied the exclusionary rule as a remedy for the violation of state law, citing, in particular, State v. Robinson, 658 A.2d 518 (R.I. 1995) as a case where this Court used the exclusionary rule to suppress a confession obtained after a violation of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We are convinced, however, that this case is not applicable to the case at bar. Robinson involved an arrest and detention made without probable cause, where the actions of the police were egregious. Robinson, 658 A.2d at 520-21. Indeed, this Court explicitly noted that what was at issue in Robinson was “[t]he violation of * * * constitutional protections,” not only a violation of a state procedural rule. Id. at 522.', '- 14 - 712. We deem Hernandez to be inapposite to the instant case. To begin with, the Supreme Judicial Court based its conclusion on its own past precedents and Massachusetts statutory law, which differ both from the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court and from our own jurisprudence. See id. at 712-13; cf. State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1167 (R.I. 2011) (declining to follow the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court with regard to jury instructions about custodial interrogations). In addition, we note that the conduct of the campus police in Hernandez was significantly more egregious than the conduct of the Pawtucket detectives here. In Hernandez, the campus police apparently decided to run a check of the defendant’s automobile when the defendant was engaged in nothing more suspicious than pumping gasoline and then proceeded to arrest the defendant for an outstanding warrant for an offense that had no connection to the university. See Hernandez, 924 N.E.2d at 711. The campus police behavior in Hernandez is not analogous to the conduct of the Pawtucket detectives here. Accordingly, we decline to adopt the reasoning of Hernandez to order the suppression of the evidence the Pawtucket detectives obtained in the instant case.', 'We recognize that Rhode Island also has a statutory exclusionary rule embodied in G.L. 1956 § 9-19-25. 17', 'This Court has, however, concluded that § 9-19-25 largely tracks the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment. See State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1113 (R.I. 1992) (“[T]his [C]ourt has, with very few exceptions, followed the opinions of the United States Supreme Court whether premised on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or on our own statutory exclusionary rule.

Moreover, because we are satisfied that, under Moore, 553 U.S. at 169, and Ryan, 731 F.3d at 69-70, defendant’s arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we conclude that it similarly did not violate defendant’s rights under article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution. See State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1050 n.3 (R.I. 2004) (noting that the Fourth Amendment “is substantively the same as article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution”); see also Brousseau v. Town of Westerly, 11 F.Supp. 2d 177, 183 (D. R.I. 1998) (recognizing that article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island constitution is generally co-extensive with the federal Fourth Amendment). Accordingly, we are of the opinion that our statutory exclusionary rule also does not mandate the suppression of the evidence obtained in this case.', 'In so doing, we emphasize that our holding is limited to the specific facts of the case at bar. We reserve for another day a decision as to whether more egregious violations of state law would trigger application of our statutory exclusionary rule. Cf. Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1112-13 (declining to expand our statutory exclusionary rule in that case beyond what was required under the Fourth Amendment).', 'As this Court has stated before, “[w]e believe that an exclusionary rule is strong medicine indeed since it deprives the trier of fact in many instances of highly relevant and reliable evidence.” Jackson, 570 A.2d at 1117. We are of the opinion that the detectives’ conduct here was not egregious enough to justify exclusion of probative evidence, and we decline to expand our exclusionary rule jurisprudence to require the suppression of evidence in the circumstances of the case at bar.

43,State : v. : Mark Ceppi.,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Mark Ceppi, appeals from a judgment of conviction on one count of domestic felony assault, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5, and one count of domestic simple assault, pursuant to § 11-5-3 and § 12-29-5, which judgment was entered on August 5, 2010, following a jury-waived trial in the Newport County Superior Court. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss a criminal information, which motion invoked Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and G.L. 1956 § 12-12-1.7. The criminal information at issue contained two counts, on both of which the defendant was eventually convicted; he posits that the criminal information package was not sufficient to establish probable cause for either of the two counts. He further contends that the trial justice committed a number of evidentiary errors during the course of the trial. Those errors, according to the defendant, were as follows: (1) finding that certain portions of the testimony of Newport Detective Christopher Hayes were not hearsay and allowing improper bolstering of the testimony of Heather King (the complaining witness) by the', '-1- testimony of Det. Hayes; (2) improperly allowing questioning of the defendant with respect to an alleged past incident of violence involving his former wife; (3) impermissibly restricting the defendant’s testimony with respect to Ms. King’s alleged intoxication; and (4) wrongly allowing Stephanie Bacon, the complaining witness’s twin sister, to testify with respect to the complaining witness’s injuries.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 6, 2009, defendant was charged by criminal information with domestic felony assault, pursuant to § 11-5-2 and § 12-29-5 (Count One), and domestic simple assault, pursuant to § 11-5-3 and § 12-29-5 (Count Two). Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal information pursuant to Rule 9.1 and § 12-12-1.7, alleging that the criminal information package “failed to establish probable cause.” On May 19, 2010, a hearing was held in Superior Court, at the close of which the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss.1 In due course, a jury-waived trial was held over six days in July and August of 2010. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'Heather King, the complaining witness, testified first at the trial. Ms. King testified that she had dated defendant from “either the end of July, 2007 or very early August, 2007” until 1', 'A more detailed discussion of the contents of the criminal information, the documents attached to it, and the hearing pertaining to the motion to dismiss is provided in Part II.A.1, infra.', '-2- May 3, 2009. She further testified that she began living with defendant in January or February of 2009. According to Ms. King’s testimony, “a couple of days before” March 17, 2009, she and defendant had an argument; she did not recall what that particular argument was about, but she acknowledged that her arguments with defendant were “usually over jealousy or controlling issues.” It was her testimony that, during the course of the March 2009 argument, defendant “punched [her] twice in [her] rib cage.”2 She stated that she heard a “crack” when she was punched in the ribs, and she added that it was confirmed that she had fractured a rib when she eventually had x-rays taken in “early May” of 2009. The March 2009 incident formed the basis of Count Two.', 'Ms. King next testified that, on May 2, 2009, she and defendant attended a charity event in Boston. It was her testimony that, during the drive home to their residence in Newport, they “pulled over” at a location “close to [Boston],” at which time they were arguing; she added that defendant “hit [her] in the head” in the course of their argument. Ms. King stated that the next morning (May 3, 2009), before defendant woke up, she deleted from his phone the name and phone number of a woman with whom defendant had been talking at the charity event which they had attended the night before. It was her testimony that later that morning defendant asked if she had deleted “numbers from [his] phone” and that she replied in the affirmative. She further testified that, later that same day, after taking one of defendant’s sons out for breakfast, she and defendant had a “conversation” about her deletion of the phone number. She stated that “at one point, [she] got upset, [and] walked away and into the bathroom” but that defendant “followed [her] into the bathroom,” “locked” the door, and “cornered” her. It was her testimony that defendant “looked at [her] with these crazy eyes” and proceeded to “hit” her “in the 2', 'Ms. King proceeded in her testimony to provide a very detailed account of the March 2009 argument, which we need not narrate for the purposes of this appeal.', '-3- stomach, the arm, the leg, and then * * * [the] head;” she added that she was hit “five to seven” times and that afterwards she felt as though her head was “going to explode.” It was this second incident which formed the basis of Count One.', 'According to Ms. King’s testimony, after the May 3 assault, she felt lethargic and was just “lying in bed” “all day long;” she added, however, that the May 3 incident prompted her to decide to leave defendant.3 With respect to her injuries, it was her testimony that the symptoms worsened and that, on May 9, 2009, she “woke up, and * * * couldn’t lift [her] head up,” at which time she went to Newport Hospital. She stated that personnel at Newport Hospital indicated that she had a “brain bleed;” she further stated that she was also told by personnel at Newport Hospital that she was “lucky to be alive” since most people with “the size of [her] hematoma * * * die within twenty-four hours of that injury.” Ms. King added that she was told that she would be “rush[ed]” to Rhode Island Hospital. It was her testimony that, at Rhode Island Hospital, she was given the option of going home, which she did, leaving Rhode Island Hospital “late” on May 9, 2009—only to return at 6 a.m. the next morning because she “couldn’t stop throwing up.” At trial, she remembered spending “more than one day” at Rhode Island Hospital before being released to stay with her sister, Stephanie Bacon, in Rutland, Massachusetts.', 'Ms. King testified that her symptoms continued to worsen4 while she was staying with her sister; she stated that she ultimately called her “doctor [in] Rhode Island” and that he said: 3', 'It was Ms. King’s testimony that, with the help of a friend, she found a place to live and that, on May 4, 2009, she moved out of the residence which she had been sharing with defendant.

We also note that, at trial, the parties stipulated that Ms. King’s subdural hematoma constituted a “serious bodily injury” under § 11-5-2.', '2.', 'The Testimony of Stephanie Bacon', 'Stephanie Bacon, Ms. King’s identical twin sister, testified at trial that she visited Ms. King in the hospital in Newport in May of 2009. In her testimony, Ms. Bacon confirmed that her sister’s symptoms intensified while she was staying with her in Rutland. Specifically, Ms. Bacon testified that Ms. King was “vomiting uncontrollably” and that her head was filled with pressure “which now we know was the blood on the brain.” Her testimony went on to confirm Ms. King’s testimony with respect to being admitted to U.

She had a brain bleed.” Defense counsel then said: “Objection to the relevance.” The trial justice stated: “It’s all right.”', '3.', 'The Testimony of Det. Christopher Hayes', 'Detective Christopher Hayes of the Newport Police Department testified that on or about May 9, 2009, he learned of an alleged assault on Ms. King; he added that he thereafter drove to Worcester to speak with her while she was at U. Mass. Medical. It was his further testimony that during his visit to U. Mass. Medical he spoke with one of Ms. King’s physicians, who told him that Ms. King had a subdural hematoma and that the possibility of performing surgery on her was being debated. During his testimony, Det. Hayes also indicated that Ms. King named defendant as her assailant.', 'After Det. Hayes had testified that one of Ms. King’s physicians told him she had a subdural hematoma, the following exchange took place:', '“[The State]: Did you, during your investigation, have a chance to', 'inquire as to what injuries she, Ms. King, was diagnosed with', 'when you went to see her?', '“[Detective Hayes]: Yes.', '“[The State]: What injuries?', '“[Detective Hayes]: We were told by her physician –', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection', '“[The Court]: There is going to be medical evidence, so you may', 'answer, Detective Hayes.” Detective Hayes proceeded to indicate in his testimony that, in addition to the just-referenced statements made to him by Ms. King’s physician with respect to her medical condition, Ms. King herself told him, when he took her statement at U.

Defense counsel asked: “Had you observed Ms. King become intoxicated from alcohol before September 12th, 2008?” The prosecutor objected and the trial justice told defense', '-7- counsel that he was asking defendant “for a conclusion” and that he needed to refine his question. After a few more questions were posed, the following exchange took place:', '“[Defense Counsel]: Okay.

The defendant testified that he and Ms. King had gone to a “restaurant/bar” across the street from their residence, where Ms. King started arguing with a woman who she believed was “flirting with” defendant. It was defendant’s testimony that he left the restaurant and returned to the residence which he shared with Ms. King. He added that she also came back to the residence about five to ten minutes later and was “yelling, [and] screaming”—only to leave again to return to the previously mentioned bar/restaurant. It was defendant’s further testimony that, another five to ten minutes later, Ms. King once again appeared at their residence. The defendant stated that, at that time, he was in the “spare bedroom” and that he locked the door of that room. According to defendant’s testimony, Ms. King started “yelling, screaming, and ramming the door;” he stated that she rammed the door about ten times before he opened it.6 He added that the next day Ms. King complained that her ribs were hurting. On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that Ms. 6', 'Ms. King, in her testimony, denied having rammed the door.', '-8- King did not complain of shoulder, elbow, wrist, or arm pain, despite the fact that she had allegedly sustained a fractured rib due to ramming the “spare room” door.', 'Addressing next the events of May 2 and 3, 2009 which gave rise to the felony assault charge, defendant testified that Ms. King had been drinking during the charity event in Boston and became “angry” due to the fact that he talked to two women at the event and exchanged phone numbers with one of them. He testified that, on the drive back to Newport, he and Ms. King stopped at a McDonald’s to get some food and that, during a “struggle over the keys,” Ms. King bit his thumb. The defendant acknowledged that the next day Ms. King complained of a headache. However, he denied ever hitting Ms. King in the bathroom. 7 He stated that he spoke to Ms. King on the phone on the night of May 3, 2009 and that he told her that they should not see each other anymore; he added that Ms. King was “very upset” by what he said.', 'During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant: “And according to your testimony is that [sic] you never laid a hand on Ms. King, right?” The defendant responded to that question in the negative. The prosecutor then asked defendant if he was “not violent,” and he replied that he was not violent. The prosecutor then proceeded to question defendant with respect to an “altercation” that he once had with his former wife. The defendant admitted to the altercation with his former wife. Defense counsel seasonably objected to the questions regarding Mr. Ceppi’s “altercation” with his former wife and made a “general objection” to any questioning related to any incidents of violence between defendant and his former wife, stating that “there’s no [R.I. R. Evid.] 404(b) exception, I believe, that fits into this evidence.” Over defense counsel’s objection, the trial justice permitted questions about the altercation as long as they did not make reference to observations made by Mr. Ceppi’s two children. The prosecutor 7', 'The defendant denied that any physical confrontation had taken place between him and Ms. King on May 3, 2009.', '-9- continued to question defendant regarding any arguments with his former wife which had become physical. In answering those questions, defendant denied kicking or hitting his former wife; he stated: “I never touched her in eighteen years.” On redirect, defendant stated that his former wife was charged with assault and battery against him in connection with an altercation that took place on March 10, 2009.', 'B', 'The Ensuing Verdict and Sentencing', 'On August 5, 2010, the trial justice issued her bench decision; she found Ms. King to be “candid,” “forthright,” and “totally credible.” As a result, she found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both Count One and Count Two. On March 8, 2011, defendant was sentenced on Count One to ten years with two years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation.

In his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss, defendant argued that the “nature and extent of the injuries specified in the information package [did] not constitute ‘serious bodily injury,’” (which is required under § 11-5-2, the violation of which was alleged in Count One). The defendant’s memorandum stated: “Even if [the court] assumes that Ms. King sustained a subdural hematoma as a result of the alleged May 3, 2009 assault, there is nothing within the witness statements, police reports or medical records to suggest that [that] injury constituted” serious bodily injury. 11 With respect to Count Two, defendant argued that the criminal information package lacked any “reference to an assault taking place on March 17, 2009” or any “eyewitness accounts.”', 'The trial justice conducted a hearing on May 19, 2010, at which the attorneys for both the state and defendant presented arguments; at the end of that hearing, the trial justice rendered a', '“Within thirty (30) days after a defendant is served with a', 'copy of an information charging him or her with an offense, he or', 'she may move in the superior court to dismiss the information on', 'the ground that the information and exhibits appended to it do not', 'demonstrate the existence of probable cause to believe that the', 'offense charged has been committed or that the defendant', 'committed it.” 10', 'Neither party has contested the timeliness vel non of the amended motion to dismiss; and, therefore, we do not address that issue. 11', 'In his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss the criminal information, defendant specifically referenced the medical records which he contends should have been attached to the information.

In her thorough decision, the trial justice began by observing that the “threshold to support probable cause is very low” and stating that she must “draw inferences * * * in the light most favorable to the State.” She held, with respect to Count Two, that there was “a substantial credibility issue” because the only account of the alleged assault contained in the criminal information package was from Stephanie Bacon, the sister of the complaining witness. However, according to the trial justice, “it is permissible for an information package to include and to rely upon an assessment of probable cause hearsay information from identified or otherwise reliable sources.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss with respect to Count Two.', 'Moving on to Count One, the trial justice, relying on this Court’s opinion in State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558 (R.I. 2009), stated that this Court has held that “factual matters must be imposed [on] a factfinder who is hearing evidence.” She proceeded to deny defendant’s motion to dismiss, ruling as follows:', '“So the [c]ourt feels that because of the dictates of the Supreme', 'Court’s allocation of proof, if you will, and a determination that', 'certain issues must be heard and can only be heard by the', 'factfinder in an evidentiary setting, the [c]ourt is compelled to', 'deny the motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause.”', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice’s decision to deny his motion to dismiss was in error.', '2.', 'Standard of Review', 'When confronted with a motion to dismiss a criminal information, the Superior Court is “‘required to examine the information and any attached exhibits to determine whether the state has satisfied its burden to establish probable cause * * * .’” State v.

The defendant relies heavily on State v. Aponte, 649 A.2d 219 (R.I. 1994) in support of his contention.', 'In order to properly address defendant’s argument, we deem it necessary to discuss the well-established law in this jurisdiction relative to this Court’s review of a motion to dismiss a grand jury indictment.', 'We have stated that “dismissal of an indictment on review is an extraordinary sanction” and that, therefore, it is “reserved for very limited and extreme circumstances.” State v.

Very importantly, however, we have repeatedly held that a “conviction by a * * * jury[13] after a full trial on the merits renders harmless any defect occurring during the grand jury proceedings.”14 Simpson, 658 A.2d at 524; and detached Superior Court justice did make a probable cause determination when the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the criminal information. 13', 'Although our case law references conviction following a jury trial, we can discern no reason why the principles that we have articulated with respect to that context would not also apply to cases such as this one where a jury-waived trial was conducted. 14', 'It is worth noting that this rule is not absolute. As the United States Supreme Court noted in United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66 (1986), certain errors or deficiencies in a grand jury proceeding (none of which are at issue in this case), such as racial discrimination in the composition of the grand jury, would not be rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by a subsequent guilty verdict. Id. at 70-71 n. 1; see also State v. Martin, 68 A.3d 467, 478 (R.I. 2013) (stating that “some fundamental flaws in the grand jury process, such as race and gender', '- 15 - see State v.

In so holding, we followed a conceptual route that paralleled the one followed by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 70 (1986). In that decision the Supreme Court held that a subsequent guilty verdict “means not only that there was probable cause to believe that the defendants were guilty as charged, but also that they are in fact guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt” and that, therefore, the guilty verdict rendered “any error in the grand jury proceeding * * * harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id.', 'The state contends that our case law with respect to the dismissal of a grand jury indictment should also be applied to a motion to dismiss a criminal information.', 'In our judgment, the state’s argument in this regard is eminently sensible, and we shall hew to it. If, as is the well-established rule, errors in a grand jury proceeding are rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by a subsequent guilty verdict on the same charge, it follows inexorably that errors in a criminal information should be rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by a subsequent guilty verdict on the same charge. That conclusion seems even more appropriate in light of the fact that a trial justice, ruling on a Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss a criminal information, is performing essentially the same function as a grand jury—namely, assessing whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime being charged. We are convinced that, since the same function is being performed in each instance, the same legal principles should be applicable.15 discrimination in the grand jury selection process, require automatic dismissal of an indictment”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 15', 'The defendant suggests that a motion to dismiss a criminal information is more aptly compared to a motion to suppress evidence than to a motion to dismiss a grand jury indictment.', '- 16 -', 'Our conclusion is not altered by the case on which defendant relies so heavily, State v. Aponte, 649 A.2d 219 (R.I. 1994). Contrary to defendant’s contention, Aponte does not stand for the proposition that a defect in a criminal information is not rendered harmless even when there is a subsequent guilty verdict on the same charge following a trial. Id. at 222. In Aponte, the defendant was charged by criminal information with assault with intent to rob and possession of a weapon not a firearm, and eventually he was convicted on both charges after a jury trial. Id. at 221. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial justice erred by denying his Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss the charge of possession of a weapon not a firearm contained in the criminal information filed against him. Aponte, 649 A.2d at 222. This Court quickly disposed of the defendant’s contention (in a single paragraph) by holding that “[t]he evidence clearly established probable cause.” Id. We made no determination in Aponte as to whether or not this Court’s precedent with respect to a motion to dismiss a grand jury indictment and a subsequent guilty verdict should be applied to a motion to dismiss a criminal information. Id. Consequently, defendant’s reliance on Aponte is unavailing.', 'Accordingly, it is our holding that any deficiency that may have existed in the criminal information package (including a lack of medical records) in this case does not rise to the level of an absence of probable cause and was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt—in light of the fact that, following a trial, defendant was eventually found guilty on both counts charged in the criminal information.16 However, we can perceive no reason why a comparison to a motion to suppress would be the more appropriate analytical approach. 16', 'The defendant also makes a number of arguments with respect to the alleged lack of probable cause to support the criminal information.

The state also points out that the fact that this was a jury-waived trial “substantially diminished” the risk of unfair prejudice. Moreover, the state argues that the testimony of Det. Hayes was clearly not bolstering because he never testified regarding any determination on his part as to the credibility of either Ms. King or her physician.18', 'We address first the issue of hearsay. It has long been established in this jurisdiction that “the admission of hearsay evidence is not prejudicial when the evidence is merely cumulative and when defendant’s guilt is sufficiently established by proper evidence.” State v.

Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 622 n. 7 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). When assessing whether or not a piece of evidence is cumulative, “the test is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence to determine whether the admission of certain evidence was harmless in light of all the evidence admitted on that point.” State v.

Moreover, any testimony by Det. Hayes with respect to the statements of Ms. King’s physicians was clearly cumulative since exactly the same information was admitted when Ms. King’s medical records were entered as an exhibit. The state is also correct that any potential prejudice would have been “substantially diminished” by the fact that this was a jury- waived trial. State v. Medeiros, 996 A.2d 115, 121 (R.I. 2010).', 'We next turn to the issue of bolstering. Impermissible bolstering occurs typically “when one witness offers an opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony of another witness.” State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 470 (R.I. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, impermissible bolstering can also occur “[e]ven when a witness does not literally state an opinion concerning the credibility of another witness but his or her testimony would have the same substantive import.” State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 315 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). We recognize that a police officer’s testimony may be given more credence by some jurors than the testimony of a lay person; however, we are simply unable to detect any reason why the testimony of Det. Hayes in this case could be considered improper bolstering. Detective Hayes merely repeated what was told to him by Ms. King and her physician. He did not make any indication of any kind (even of the most minor variety) with respect to his personal opinion about the veracity of their statements.

The defendant avers that “[t]he prosecutor was in effect accusing [him] of an assault on his former wife, even though the prosecution’s offer of proof included a police report which contained an admission by the defendant’s former wife that she assaulted the defendant.” He posits that the “impermissible implication that [defendant] had engaged in violent conduct with his former wife” was inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'In accordance with Rule 404(b), any evidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” committed by defendant was not admissible to prove that defendant had a certain character and acted in accordance with his character (i.e., propensity evidence) when allegedly committing the crimes with which he was charged.19 Our thorough review of the record indicates that, even if 19', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence reads, in its entirety, as follows:', '- 23 - the questions with respect to defendant’s former wife were in violation of Rule 404(b), such a violation would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 563 (R.I. 2014) (concluding that, even if there had been a violation of Rule 404(b), it would have been “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt”); see also State v. Bailey, 677 A.2d 407, 411 (R.I. 1996). No documents with respect to any altercation between defendant and his former wife were admitted into evidence; and, in his testimony, defendant repeatedly denied ever kicking or hitting his former wife. Importantly, defendant was also given an opportunity during re-direct examination to testify that it was his then-wife, and not he, who was charged with respect to the alleged violent confrontation at issue. Additionally, as the state points out, this was a jury-waived trial—and the risk of prejudice is significantly reduced in that context. See Medeiros, 996 A.2d at 121. Moreover, the above-quoted comments by the trial justice make it clear that she understood that it was not defendant who had been charged with respect to the incident involving his former wife. Taking all those facts into account, we hold that, even if the questioning with respect to defendant’s former wife and any violent altercations between them had been in violation of Rule 404(b), such error would have been harmless.', 'ii.', 'The Opinion of Defendant as to the Intoxication of the Complaining Witness', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice “erroneously refused to allow him to testify that [Ms. King] was under the influence of alcohol” on direct examination. He refers specifically to questions asked by defense counsel with respect to whether or not defendant had observed Ms.', '“Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes,', 'wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person', 'in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It', 'may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of', 'motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,', 'absence of mistake or accident, or to prove that defendant feared', 'imminent bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.”', '- 24 - King become intoxicated in the past and whether she was under the influence of alcohol on a particular evening.20 With respect to those questions the trial justice instructed defense counsel to ask the witness about his observations, not his “conclusion[s].” The defendant avers that the fact that he had been dating Ms. King for “ten months” was “adequate foundation” for the questions, and he contends the following: “This Court has said lay opinions of intoxication are permitted if the witness has had an adequate opportunity to observe the person about whom the testimony is offered and is able to offer a [sic] sufficient detail for an opinion.”', 'We note that the trial justice did not in fact exclude all testimony with regard to Ms. King’s intoxication on various dates in question; rather, she simply required defendant to testify with respect to what he observed about Ms. King, rather than simply offering a conclusory statement that she was intoxicated. That requirement imposed by the trial justice was consistent with the relevant case law from this Court cited by defendant. See State v. Bruskie, 536 A.2d 522, 524 (R.I. 1988); State v. Fogarty, 433 A.2d 972, 975-76 (R.I. 1981). In our decision in Fogarty, we held that a lay witness may testify with respect to whether or not someone was intoxicated if the witness “had an opportunity to observe the person and [can provide] the concrete details on which the inference or description is founded.” Fogarty, 433 A.2d at 976. The trial justice in the instant case was merely requiring defense counsel to ask about the “concrete details” which formed the basis of his conclusion that Ms. King was intoxicated. Id.; see also State v. Gomes, 604 A.2d 1249, 1258-59 (R.I. 1992) (holding that a portion of a deposition which was not read into evidence at trial due to the fact that the trial justice sustained the prosecutor’s objection to that portion, in which the witness stated that a certain individual 20', 'See Part I.A.4, supra.', '- 25 - was intoxicated, was properly excluded because the witness failed to provide any concrete “details” on which his determination was based).', 'Moreover, defense counsel was permitted to continue asking questions about defendant’s observations of Ms. King’s behavior after she was drinking, and defendant was permitted to testify with respect to Ms. King’s behavior when she had been drinking. Therefore, there is no merit to defendant’s argument that the trial justice “erroneously refused to allow him to testify that [Ms. King] was under the influence of alcohol.”', '3.', 'The Testimony of Stephanie Bacon', 'The defendant objects on appeal to the complaining witness’s sister having been permitted to testify that Ms. King had a “brain bleed” because, according to defendant, that statement was hearsay and was “not probative.”', 'Any contention as to Ms. Bacon’s testimony constituting hearsay is not properly before this Court since no objection on that basis was articulated before the trial justice.21 See State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011) (“This Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule, which requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.”). Additionally, even if Ms. Bacon’s testimony was not relevant, it was quite clearly cumulative in view of the fact that Ms. King’s medical records were admitted into evidence and Ms. King was allowed to testify as to her injuries. See Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032. As a result, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in allowing Ms. Bacon to testify regarding her sister’s injury.22 21', 'Defense counsel specifically stated: “Objection to the relevance.” See Part I.A.2, supra, for further details relative to the testimony by the complaining witness’s sister. 22', 'The defendant has raised two additional contentions on appeal.

Fifteen years after he had been convicted, but only one year after a hearing justice had ordered him to serve the remaining fifteen years of a previously suspended sentence, David A. Roscoe filed an application for postconviction relief in which he attacked his original conviction. An attorney was appointed to represent him, but the appointed attorney filed a no-merit memorandum and moved to withdraw.', 'Following a hearing, the attorney was allowed to withdraw. Ultimately, Roscoe’s application was denied and he appealed to this Court, arguing that the hearing justice erred when she allowed his attorney to withdraw. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 28, 1990, applicant Roscoe was convicted of several charges: first-degree child molestation, second-degree child molestation, simple assault and battery, and intimidation of a witness or victim. He was then sentenced to thirty years imprisonment, with fifteen years to', '-1- serve and fifteen years suspended, with probation. This Court affirmed applicant’s conviction in State v. Roscoe, 603 A.2d 330, 331 (R.I. 1992) (mem.).', 'The applicant was released from prison in 2001. In early 2003, Roscoe was charged in District Court with simple assault. The next year, a judge convicted applicant and sentenced him to a year in prison, with three months to serve and the remainder suspended.', 'The conduct underlying the 2003 assault charge also formed the basis of 2004 probation- violation hearings in the Superior Court. A justice of that court determined that applicant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation, which originally had been imposed as part of his 1991 thirty-year sentence. That justice vacated the suspension of the remaining fifteen years of applicant’s 1991 sentence.', 'On June 14, 2005, Roscoe filed a postconviction-relief application. He asserted several grounds that he contended justified relief from his 1990 conviction, including allegations that: (1) the trial justice had been biased against him, (2) his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance, and (3) there had been insufficient evidence to find him guilty. An attorney was appointed to represent Roscoe in his postconviction-relief action.', 'On October 19, 2007, the attorney who had been appointed to represent Roscoe filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record. Along with his motion to withdraw, counsel filed a no-merit memorandum in accordance with Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 135 (R.I. 2000). In that memorandum, the attorney set forth the reasons underlying his conclusion that applicant’s grounds for relief lacked merit.', 'A justice of the Superior Court held a hearing on the attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel. During that proceeding, the hearing justice described for Roscoe the nature of his attorney’s motion:', '-2-', '“[Y]ou understand that [the attorney’s] recommendation to the', 'Court, though it is based upon the issues that are before me, that', 'you would not likely be successful on any of these legal issues;', 'therefore, he’s requesting that he be allowed to withdraw as', 'counsel so that he doesn’t have to proceed any further on the post-', 'conviction relief motion.” After the attorney clarified that his motion and memorandum related only to those issues that Roscoe had raised, he, Roscoe, and the hearing justice engaged in a further colloquy about the attorney’s motion.', 'The attorney added that he had explained to Roscoe the level to which the evidence must rise to warrant relief. The attorney also said that applicant was “justified in having some concerns” but “it d[id] not rise to the level, in [the attorney’s] opinion, to allow the [c]ourt this additional review[.]” The hearing justice then addressed applicant, “That’s correct, even though you have what may be some legitimate concerns.” Finally, Roscoe himself asked, “There is no way that we can prove it, is that what he’s saying?” The hearing justice answered that applicant was correct.', 'Following that discussion, the hearing justice granted the motion to withdraw as to the issues raised in Roscoe’s original postconviction-relief application. In doing so, she asked Roscoe whether he wished to represent himself on the issues that he had raised and counsel had analyzed in the Shatney memorandum.', 'Roscoe responded that he intended to continue researching the issues but that he did not know whether he wished to proceed and have a hearing on the three original grounds. The hearing justice also appointed the attorney to research another issue, that is, the fact that the judge who presided over applicant’s conviction in District Court had been the prosecutor in the 1990 Superior Court trial. 1 1', 'At the hearing on his motion to withdraw, appointed counsel informed the court that Roscoe had told him of his concern that the prosecutor at the 1990 trial for the sexual-assault charges', '-3-', 'On September 19, 2008, there was an evidentiary hearing on the postconviction-relief application, at which Roscoe represented himself. During that hearing, Roscoe was the only witness. He testified about the assistance provided to him by his trial counsel, the trial justice’s prejudice or bias towards him during the 1990 trial, and the lack of evidence at his trial. After Roscoe had been cross-examined, the hearing justice asked him twice whether he had anything else that he wished to present; nothing further was brought forth. Ultimately, the hearing justice denied Roscoe’s postconviction-relief application, precipitating a timely appeal to this Court. 2', 'Before this Court, Roscoe contends that the hearing justice erred when she allowed his attorney to withdraw from the case. Specifically, he argues that she should have allowed him to raise additional issues before permitting counsel to withdraw. He also contends that the hearing justice’s comment that Roscoe had “legitimate concerns” should have dissuaded her from granting the motion to withdraw. Roscoe also maintains that the factual inquiry into his grounds for postconviction relief was insufficient to allow his counsel to withdraw. Finally, applicant avers that the hearing justice compounded her error in allowing counsel to withdraw because she did not appoint successor counsel. 3 was later appointed to the District Court bench and presided over his 2003 simple-assault trial. The trial justice directed counsel to explore that issue, but we see nothing in the record that would indicate that counsel filed anything with the court pertaining to the subject. In her decision after the evidentiary hearing on the postconviction-relief application, the trial justice addressed the issue and found that it had no merit. We can conceive of no set of circumstances under which an assault conviction in 2003 could undermine the fairness of a sexual-assault trial that took place thirteen years earlier. 2', 'The applicant’s notice of appeal was filed on August 12, 2009, the same day that the hearing justice issued her decision. A final judgment in accordance with that decision was not entered until August 14, 2009. We previously have treated a premature notice of appeal as valid. Miller v. Saunders, 80 A.3d 44, 51 n.8 (R.I. 2013) (citing Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011)). 3', 'After a single-justice conference was held pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A(3) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, the parties were ordered to address the issue of laches.

In Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677, 679 (R.I. 2013), appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw along with a no-merit memorandum, and a Superior Court justice held a hearing on the matter. Having determined that the applicant’s arguments were meritless, the hearing justice granted the motion, instructed the applicant that he could proceed pro se, and allowed the applicant to file a memorandum with additional arguments supporting his application. Id. On review, we held that the hearing justice had “strictly adhered to all those procedures” required by Shatney. Perez, 57 A.3d at 679.', 'We reached a similar result in Brown v. State, 841 A.2d 1116, 1123 (R.I. 2004), in which we said that a trial justice “essentially followed” Shatney when she conducted a hearing at which an applicant was “afforded * * * an opportunity to speak on his own behalf and to dispute the points made in his counsel’s no-merit memorandum.” In another case, we concluded that an applicant who had been afforded multiple hearings and had been given the opportunity to respond to his attorney’s two no-merit memoranda also had not been “denied the procedural protections of Shatney.” Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 317 (R.I. 2008).', 'In this case, it is our opinion that the trial justice abided by the procedure set forth in Shatney and that applicant received all the protections due to him. The hearing justice reviewed the attorney’s no-merit memorandum, which she lauded as detailed and complete, and she held a hearing on the motion to withdraw. During that hearing, she heard from the attorney and then inquired of applicant whether he had read the memorandum and whether he had any questions. Roscoe said that he had indeed read it and that he did not have any questions. “[O]ur caselaw indicates that an applicant bears some responsibility before the trial justice to dispute the content of the Shatney memorandum or raise any issues overlooked by the Shatney attorney.” State v.', '-6- Laurence, 18 A.3d 512, 523 (R.I. 2011). But here, Roscoe offered nothing that his attorney “for whatever reason, may have overlooked or wrongly deemed frivolous.” See id. (quoting Shatney, 755 A.2d at 133) (emphasis omitted).', 'We conclude that the hearing justice was not clearly wrong and did not overlook or misconceive material evidence when she agreed with the conclusion of Roscoe’s attorney that the application lacked merit before she granted the motion to withdraw. See Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1283. Two of the grounds raised in the application, lack of evidence and judicial bias, are more properly brought in a direct appeal. Indeed, all the cases claiming judicial bias that have come before this Court have been direct appeals. See, e.g., Krivitsky v. Krivitsky, 43 A.3d 23, 32-33 (R.I. 2012); Yates v. Wall, 973 A.2d 621, 621 (R.I. 2009) (mem.); State v. Lyons, 924 A.2d 756, 763-64 (R.I. 2007); see also Washington v. State, 675 N.W.2d 628, 630 (Minn. 2004) (relying on the fact that “issues * * * known by the defendant but not raised on direct appeal, are not considered in a subsequent petition for postconviction relief” to bar the consideration of a judicial-bias claim). The supposed bias is alleged to have occurred before and during Roscoe’s trial and includes a comment made during his arraignment. 4 Any claim of bias was therefore known to him at the time of his direct appeal to this Court; therefore, a postconviction-relief application was not the proper way to assert such a claim.', 'Additionally, any argument that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to convict him or was otherwise unpersuasive should have been made to the trial justice and then raised before this Court on direct appeal. In fact, one of the arguments that we rejected in Roscoe’s original appeal was that the trial justice erred when he denied a motion for judgment of acquittal on the witness-intimidation charge. Roscoe, 603 A.2d at 330. 4', 'Roscoe alleged that during his arraignment, the justice presiding over the proceeding was heard to mutter in Italian that those who molest children should be severely punished.', '-7-', 'We also agree with the hearing justice’s determination that Roscoe’s postconviction- relief attorney should have been allowed to withdraw because applicant’s contention that he had been prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of trial counsel was without merit. According to the Shatney memorandum, Roscoe’s trial counsel diligently pursued the only defense available to him, which was that the victim was lying. We cannot conclude that the hearing justice erred when she determined that appointed counsel could withdraw from the case but that Roscoe would be able to proceed pro se.', 'We also cannot say that the hearing justice’s indulgent remark that applicant had “what may be some legitimate concerns” required her to deny the motion to withdraw.', 'The determination to be made in a proceeding held pursuant to Shatney is whether the claims lack merit. See Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 456 (R.I. 2012) (“Without the ability to withdraw from a case in which the applicant persists in pursuing meritless claims, appointed counsel could be subject to [Super. R. Civ. P.] Rule 11’s sanctions.”). An applicant’s genuine belief that he or she is entitled to relief does not transform the asserted grounds into those having legal merit. We conclude that the trial justice’s comment that Roscoe had “concerns” does not collide with her conclusion that the claims were without legal merit. Based on the record, it appears that Roscoe understood the comments in the same manner because he responded to the hearing justice by asking whether his attorney had determined that the claims could not be proven.', 'We also reject applicant’s argument that the factual inquiry into his claims was insufficient. In his Shatney memorandum, Roscoe’s attorney described how he had arrived at his determination concerning the application: he met with applicant twice, spoke to applicant’s trial attorney, read applicant’s correspondence, and reviewed the prior case’s file and transcript. On appeal, Roscoe fails to point out what else, if anything, his attorney could or should have done.', '-8- Rather, applicant assails the fact that his attorney failed to disclose the details of the conversations he had with Roscoe.', 'We are satisfied that applicant’s postconviction-relief counsel engaged in a satisfactory factual inquiry into the nature of Roscoe’s claims. Additionally, when his attorney was allowed to withdraw, Roscoe had the opportunity to press his claims in an evidentiary hearing before the hearing justice ultimately denied the application.', 'Finally, we disagree with the applicant’s assertion that the hearing justice should have appointed successor counsel after granting the motion to withdraw. Once the hearing justice granted the motion to withdraw, the applicant was afforded the opportunity to pursue his claims pro se. Roscoe’s right to the assistance of counsel is guided by the principles set forth in Shatney; because the hearing justice followed the procedures outlined in that case before permitting counsel to withdraw, Roscoe’s option was to represent himself if he decided to pursue the application. Requiring the appointment of another attorney would defeat the purpose of allowing appointed attorneys to withdraw from postconviction-relief cases that lack legal merit. See Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56. Thus, the applicant’s right to counsel was not undermined by the hearing justice’s failure to appoint a second lawyer for him.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Avis testified about the vaginal intercourse which she alleged she had been subjected to 1', 'In order to respect the privacy of the complaining witness and that of her family, we have used pseudonyms in referring to the complaining witness (“Avis”), her sister (“Marion”), and the mother of both girls (“Wendy”). For the same reason, we have omitted their surnames. In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '-2- by defendant on multiple occasions; she also testified as to incidents of anal penetration, although she acknowledged that those incidents had occurred “rarely.” Her testimony then focused on three particular incidents when defendant had sexually molested her, and those were the incidents referenced in the three counts of the indictment.', 'With respect to Count One, Avis stated that defendant sexually molested her for the first time at her home on Holton Street in Providence;2 it was her testimony that, on that occasion, all of her brothers and sisters were home and her mother was away from home. Avis testified that she had been lying on her side next to defendant on his bed tickling his back when defendant said to her: “Have you ever had sex with anyone before?” She further testified that, after she replied in the negative, he said: “You’re going to find out.” She stated that defendant then “turn[ed] around and [grabbed]” her by her shoulders so that she was lying on her back and that he proceeded to pull down her pajama pants and underwear. She further described, with specificity, how defendant then engaged in vaginal intercourse with her. Avis stated that she was crying and that she told defendant that he was hurting her. She explained, however, that she did not yell out for help because she “didn’t know how to react” and that she was “shocked.” Avis stated that defendant then told her that, if she told anyone about what happened, he would take her away; and she acknowledged that she believed defendant’s statement to that effect.', 'Avis then testified with respect to another incident of sexual molestation (Count Two) that occurred while she was still living on Holton Street. Avis initially testified that defendant penetrated her vaginally on that occasion; however, she then changed her testimony and said that the intercourse was either vaginal or anal but that she could not remember which it was. After 2', 'It is clear from the record that the first incident about which Avis testified occurred in August of 2008. She was ten years old at that time.', '-3- having her memory refreshed by her testimony at defendant’s bail hearing, Avis stated that defendant had penetrated her anally.', 'Avis testified that the incident that gave rise to Count Three occurred when she was living on Harold Street in Providence in March of 2009. It was Avis’s testimony that she had been with Marion in the bedroom which they shared when defendant entered the room and asked Marion to leave so that he could talk to Avis. She testified that defendant then engaged in vaginal intercourse with her in a manner similar to what had taken place on the first occasion that she testified about at trial.', 'Avis acknowledged that, at some point after the just-described incident had taken place, she responded in the negative to a question posed by Marion as to whether anything was “happening” between her and defendant. She testified that Marion asked her the same question once again after defendant had moved out of the home in May of 2009 and that she then admitted that defendant had penetrated her vaginally “multiple times.”3 She further testified: “I figured that I was sick and tired of him sexually abusing me and I felt gross, grossed out helpless, and desperate for help.” She stated that she had not previously revealed the sexual molestation to anyone when defendant had left4 the home on other occasions because she had been “scared” due to defendant’s threats and because she “knew he was going to come back. He always did.” 3', 'Marion also testified with respect to the conversation that is referenced in the text. Her testimony corroborated her sister’s testimony. However, Marion acknowledged on cross- examination that, in an attempt to have Avis confide in her, she had lied to Avis and told her that she was “having sex” with her boyfriend. She also acknowledged that she then asked Avis if she was also “having sex,” to which Avis replied in the affirmative. Marion stated that, after “a while,” Avis disclosed that it was defendant with whom she was “having sex.” 4', 'Wendy acknowledged in her testimony that, during the course of her marriage, defendant would periodically “leave the marriage or go stay someplace else” but that every time she would “take him back.” At trial, she specifically recalled two such occasions.', '-4- However, it was Avis’s testimony that, after defendant and her mother had a “big argument” in May of 2009, she had the “instinct that he wasn’t coming back.”', 'Avis testified that, shortly after she told Marion about the sexual molestation and even though she had asked Marion not to do so, her sister nonetheless revealed Avis’s allegations of sexual molestation to their mother, Wendy, who then confronted her. She further testified that Wendy was “screaming and crying and mad” and proceeded to drive her to Hasbro Children’s Hospital for an examination.5 She stated that, in the days after that, she had “a lot of mixed emotions” and that she was “crying and relieved at the same time.”', '2.', 'The Testimony of the Sister of the Complaining Witness', 'Avis’s older sister, Marion, testified that in March of 2009 defendant entered the bedroom which she shared with Avis and asked Marion to leave and tend to her siblings so that he could talk to Avis. Marion further testified that she wanted to hear what they were talking about and that, therefore, she listened through the bathroom wall. She stated that she heard defendant say, “Stop and be quiet.” In response to a question posed to her on cross-examination, she acknowledged that she also heard “a female and a male moaning.” According to Marion’s testimony, defendant and Avis were in the bedroom together for “probably” longer than ten minutes; she added that, when they left the room, she observed that the bed was a “mess.” Marion stated that, because of what she had heard on that occasion, she thereafter asked Avis “if anything was going on with her and [defendant]” but that Avis “kept saying no.” It was Marion’s testimony that, when Avis eventually disclosed that defendant had been having sexual intercourse with her, Marion then informed their mother about that disclosure. 5', 'As we shall discuss more fully infra, Wendy’s testimony indicated that Marion revealed Avis’s allegations of sexual abuse to her on July 6, 2009 and that she took Avis to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in the early hours of July 8—the day of a Family Court hearing on a temporary restraining order that Wendy had sought against defendant.', '-5-', '3.', 'The Testimony of the Mother of the Complaining Witness', 'Avis’s mother, Wendy, testified that, on May 11, 2009,6 she sought and obtained a temporary restraining order in Family Court against defendant due to an altercation that had occurred two days earlier in which defendant allegedly had physically abused her. She further testified that thereafter defendant moved out of the shared residence. She stated that, at that time, she told Avis that defendant was not coming back. According to Wendy’s testimony, defendant subsequently filed for divorce.', 'In addition, Wendy denied instructing Avis or Marion or anyone else to falsely accuse defendant of child molestation; she further denied that the allegations against defendant were “working out” to her benefit in any way (specifically with respect to the Family Court proceedings) or that she was attempting to take away from defendant the children of whom they were the biological parents in order to get even with him for allegedly abusing her.', '4.', 'The Expert Medical Testimony', 'Doctor Rachel Clingenpeel was qualified by the trial justice as an expert in child abuse pediatrics. Doctor Clingenpeel testified that she was a fellow in the Child Protection Program at Hasbro Children’s Hospital and that she examined Avis on July 8, 2009.', 'It was Dr. Clingenpeel’s testimony that she discussed Avis’s medical history with Wendy, who told her that Avis had disclosed that “she had been sexually abused including penile * * * penetration by her stepfather.” Doctor Clingenpeel explained that, in the presence of the attending physician, Dr. Amy Goldberg, she then conducted a complete “head-to-toe” physical examination of Avis. 6', 'It will be recalled that Wendy would once again be in Family Court with respect to the restraining order against defendant on July 8, 2009. See footnote 5, supra; see also Part I.A.5, infra.', '-6-', 'Doctor Clingenpeel testified that the files of the Child Protection Program contained a medical record for Avis stemming from a previous visit in 2001 when she was three years old.7 Doctor Clingenpeel stated that, during that earlier visit, Dr. Goldberg had similarly conducted a complete “head-to-toe” physical examination of Avis. She added that Dr. Goldberg’s report regarding the 2001 examination indicated that Avis had a “completely normal physical exam” and specifically noted that she had “ample hymenal tissue,” meaning that there was “no doubt that there was a normal amount of tissue.”', 'Doctor Clingenpeel testified that, during the examination in July of 2009, she observed that Avis had “begun the process of going through puberty.” She added that, “when we see kids who have effects of puberty we expect to see a thicker more folded hymen;” she then testified that, with respect to Avis, “instead we saw very little hymen at all.”', 'Doctor Clingenpeel explained that the finding of “minimal hymenal tissue” during Avis’s exam alone “would have been abnormal and concerning.” She added that she would have “expect[ed] to see [that Avis] would have even more tissue there than on the previous exam [i.e., in 2001] and instead she had very minimal hymen.” Doctor Clingenpeel further testified that, in her opinion (which she rendered to a reasonable degree of medical certainty), the changes in Avis’s hymen between the 2001 exam and the 2009 exam “were due to penetrating vaginal trauma” by “an outside force.”8 7', 'Doctor Clingenpeel testified that Avis had been examined at Hasbro Children’s Hospital when she was three years old as the result of an allegation of neglect that had been received by the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. She testified that, during that visit, Dr. Goldberg, at that time a fellow in the Child Protection Program, conducted a genital examination on Avis according to standard procedure, even though Dr. Clingenpeel acknowledged that at that time there was no allegation or disclosure of sexual abuse. 8', 'The defendant testified at trial that Wendy had two vibrators, one of which “looked like the replica of a penis.” He further testified that Wendy would leave both of the vibrators “in various spots in the house” to which the children had access, including the children’s rooms. It was Avis’s testimony that she had seen each of Wendy’s vibrators.', '-7- Doctor Clingenpeel acknowledged that, in her report, she stated that “minimal hymenal tissue is concerning for chronic sexual abuse.” At trial, she explained her use of the term “chronic” as follows:', '“This was not something that had happened to her in the last few', 'days or the last week. This is something that had happened in the', 'past and then healed. Also in our experience when we see this type', 'of finding on a genital exam it is most consistent or likely to have', 'been caused by multiple episodes of vaginal penetrating trauma.', 'However, we cannot exclude that there was a single episode of', 'severe trauma to the hymen causing this finding but it’s most', 'consistent with multiple episodes of penetrating trauma * * * .” Doctor Clingenpeel further stated that, with respect to her opinion concerning this case, she had consulted with Dr. Goldberg, who as the attending physician signed off on all of her reports—as she did in this case.9', 'Doctor Goldberg also testified at trial, and her testimony was substantively similar to that of Dr. Clingenpeel. Doctor Goldberg stated that, during Avis’s 2009 examination, she observed that Avis had “minimal hymenal tissue”—which was itself “highly, highly concerning for penetrating trauma or a history of penetrating trauma;” additionally, based on her comparison of', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Clingenpeel if the change in Avis’s hymen could have been caused by “some type of plastic penis.” Doctor Clingenpeel replied: “In what context?” Defense counsel responded: “In the context of penetrating her vagina with some plastic penis” by “anyone” or by Avis “herself.” In response, Dr. Clingenpeel then stated:', '“That’s not something that children of [Avis’s] age or pubertal', 'development do because it is painful before they have gone', 'through all of the pubertal stages and so if I heard that an 11-year-', 'old child had indeed been putting objects into her own vagina, I', 'would be concerned. That is very developmentally abnormal', 'sexual behavior and that child may have * * *, in fact, been', 'sexually abused.” 9', 'Doctor Clingenpeel testified that Avis had a normal anal exam. She also testified that “[t]he vast majority of children that have been sexually assaulted through anal penetration have a normal external anal exam.”', '-8- Avis’s two examinations, it was her expert opinion that the changes in Avis’s hymen were caused by “vaginal penetration.” When she explained the meaning of the statement in Avis’s medical report that the results of Avis’s exam were “concerning for chronic sexual abuse,” Dr. Goldberg’s testimony was similar to Dr. Clingenpeel’s above-quoted testimony; however, Dr. Goldberg elaborated as follows: “The use of chronic also is a term that we used to suggest multiple times, that her exam was most consistent with something that had happened to her many times that there was vaginal penetration, not on one occasion but on more than one occasion, and probably more than two occasions * * * .” Doctor Goldberg further testified: “I have seen several children who had accidental trauma as well as with forced penetration with objects, different objects, one forced penetration where basically their whole hymen is taken out and their healing pattern is different.” It was her testimony that she was not willing to exclude the possibility that the change in Avis’s hymen was the result of “one very forceful event,” but she stated that “that’s not what [Avis’s] history reveals at all.”', '5.', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant, Adam Lake, testified in his own defense. He denied that he had ever touched Avis “in a sexual way” or engaged in sexual intercourse with her. According to his testimony, he had been having marital problems with Wendy since 2007. He acknowledged that, during the course of their relationship, there had been fights which became physical.', 'He further testified that he first learned of Avis’s allegations against him on July 8, 2009 in a courthouse hallway where a hearing for a temporary restraining order involving Wendy and defendant was to be held. It was his testimony that Wendy was “screaming * * * at the top of her lungs” about what Avis said he had been doing to her. He stated that Wendy said, “You’ve', '-9- been raping my daughter,” and that he replied, “I can’t believe you’re stooping this low.”10 He also stated that Wendy then “gave [him] a smile and walked away.”', 'B', 'The Verdict, the Motion for a New Trial, and the Sentencing', 'On January 10, 2012, the jury convicted defendant on Counts One and Three (both charging “penile/vaginal penetration”) but acquitted him with respect to Count Two (alleging “penile/anal penetration”). Subsequently, on February 27, 2012, defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that the present case is one in which he “should have been found guilty of all three counts or not guilty of all three counts.” The defendant asserted that, in his opinion, there was no distinction in the evidence presented on each of the three counts, given that the same people, location, and type of conduct were involved in each of the charged offenses according to Avis’s testimony; and, therefore, defendant suggested that “the weight of the evidence is really not strong against [him]” and that the verdict “does not do substantial justice in this case.”', 'In due course, defendant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of forty years imprisonment, with twenty-five years to serve and the remaining fifteen years suspended, with probation. The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court. On appeal, defendant challenges only the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that “the trial justice overlooked and misconceived the material evidence;” he adds that “her decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial was 10', 'Providence Police Detective Christopher Rotella, who accompanied Wendy to the hearing on the temporary restraining order, was called by the state in rebuttal; he testified that, when Wendy accused defendant of rape, he did not verbally respond and was “[v]ery calm, very stoic.”', '- 10 - clearly wrong.” The defendant specifically argues that the testimony of Avis, Marion, and Wendy “was so characterized by inconsistency and inherent improbability as to undermine support for the jury’s verdict,”11 whereas the witnesses for the defense were (in defendant’s view) “forthright and believable.” The defendant also argues that the testimony of the medical witnesses, Dr. Clingenpeel and Dr. Goldberg, “added little weight to the state’s case.” He further asserts that the verdicts failed to truly respond to the evidence or to do substantial justice between the parties.', 'In ruling on a motion for a new trial, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Baker, 79 A.3d 1267, 1273 (R.I. 2013); State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013); State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011). In fulfilling his or her role as the thirteenth juror, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 11', 'The defendant questions several aspects of Avis’s testimony. For example, defendant takes issue with her lack of memory with respect to the details of the charged incidents, including whether defendant was using crutches (as defendant alleges he was) during the time frame in which the incidents that were the basis for Counts One and Two allegedly occurred. The defendant questions the credibility of Avis’s testimony with respect to those counts because, although Avis testified at trial that defendant had sexually molested her when he was “on crutches” (which contradicted her testimony at defendant’s bail hearing), she did not specifically mention that detail in her testimony with respect to either Count One or Two. Additionally, defendant states that “it defies belief” that Avis would not have cried out during the first incident of sexual molestation that was the basis for Count One given her testimony that all of her siblings were home at that time. It is clear from the record, however, that in ruling on the motion for a new trial, the trial justice took into account these and other contentions by defendant about the credibility of Avis and in the end concluded that the essence of her testimony was credible. See generally State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012).', ""- 11 - also State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013); State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006). If, after carrying out this three-step analytical process, “the trial justice agrees with the jury's verdict or determines that reasonable minds could differ, then the analysis is complete and the verdict should be affirmed.” State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 445 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 590 (R.I. 2011). On the other hand, if the trial justice “does not agree with the verdict or does not agree that reasonable minds could differ, then the trial justice must determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445 (internal quotation marks omitted)."", 'With respect to trial court rulings on motions for a new trial, we have stated that the “record should reflect a few sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.” State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we have also indicated that “[i]n providing a rationale for a decision * * * the trial justice need * * * only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', ""“On review, we accord great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Espinal, 943 A.2d at 1058; see also State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 983-84 (R.I. 2007). Accordingly, this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s decision with respect to such a motion “unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” DiCarlo, 987 A.2d at 871 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445. In reviewing a denial of a motion for a new trial, “we do not focus on whether this Court simply agrees or disagrees with the trial justice's"", '- 12 - credibility determinations,” but rather we are “deferential to those determinations;” and “we will not overturn that decision unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 842 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have repeatedly noted that “[t]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DiCarlo, 987 A.2d at 872.', 'The record clearly indicates that the trial justice made comprehensive findings which served as the basis for her denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial. In ruling on defendant’s motion, the trial justice performed the required three-step analysis. See Rosario, 35 A.3d at 947. The trial justice first considered the evidence in light of the charge to the jury, noting that defendant was convicted of the two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault alleging “penile/vaginal penetration,” but was acquitted of the count which charged him with “penile/anal penetration.” She then, in accordance with the second required step, meticulously reviewed and summarized the testimony of the key witnesses at trial, weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of those witnesses. Notably, it was her determination that “the crux of the case, given the nature of the charges, was the testimony of the complaining witness herself,” and the trial justice manifested no hesitation as to the credibility of that witness.', 'As was incumbent upon her in her role as the thirteenth juror, the trial justice made the following assessment of credibility:', '“[Avis’s] testimony about the two incidents that were the subject', 'of the jury’s verdicts in Count’s [sic] one and three was very', '- 13 -', 'credible. While she could not recall exact times and dates or', 'her * * * age * * * at the time of the incident, she was quite clear', 'that they happened in the way she described.” The record also reflects that the trial justice carefully considered not only the consistencies but the alleged inconsistencies in Avis’s testimony as well; the trial justice stated that “[a]ny confusion or lack of detail on [Avis’s] part could well be explained by the number of times she testified she was sexually abused by the defendant * * * .” Significantly, the trial justice found that “[i]n this Court’s judgment the credible testimony alone of [Avis] as to Counts one and three is sufficient to, in and of itself, sustain the jury’s verdicts.”', 'Upon concluding her analysis, the trial justice stated: “When all of this testimony and evidence is considered, reasonable fact-finders could have found as I found the defendant guilty of Counts one and three of the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.” In accordance with the well-established principles in this domain, the trial justice proceeded to deny defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Guerra, 12 A.3d at 765 (stating that if, after conducting the required three- step analysis, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, “then the inquiry is at an end and the motion for a new trial should be denied”); see also State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012).', 'After carefully reviewing the record in this case, it is clear to us that defendant’s various arguments on appeal essentially amount to little more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. See State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 103 (R.I. 2012) (stating that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011). As we have stated on multiple occasions, “the presence of some', '- 14 - inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948–49; State v. Shepard, 33 A.3d 158, 164 (R.I. 2011); State v. Cerda, 957 A.2d 382, 386 (R.I. 2008).', 'This Court’s confidence in the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s new trial motion is reinforced by the medical testimony that was presented in the instant case. It is clear that the trial justice credited the testimony of both Dr. Clingenpeel and Dr. Goldberg that the change in Avis’s hymen between the 2001 and the 2009 examinations was, in Dr. Clingenpeel’s words, “most consistent or likely to have been caused by multiple episodes of vaginal penetrating trauma.” It is our determination that the trial justice quite understandably found that, with respect to the two incidents of sexual abuse charged in Counts One and Three, the medical testimony “was credible and weighty as corroborative evidence to the credible testimony of [Avis].”', ""Additionally, it is noteworthy that the jury acquitted defendant of the second count in the indictment. That acquittal constitutes a basis for inferring that the jury took its responsibility seriously and thoughtfully and conscientiously considered the facts and the credibility of the witnesses in light of the jury charge before rendering its verdict. Cf. State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 901 (R.I. 2010) (stating that “the jury's thoughtfulness in its consideration of the facts and credibility of the witnesses * * * may be inferred from [the] defendant's conviction on one count of a lesser-included offense”). The trial justice noted that, although she found Avis’s testimony to be credible with respect to Count Two, the testimony and the evidence presented relative to Count Two were “not of the same weight as that connected with Counts one and three;” in our judgment, the trial justice wisely acknowledged that the jury’s acquittal of defendant on Count"", '- 15 - Two did not undermine the guilty verdicts in view of the differences in the evidence presented with respect to Count Two in comparison to Counts One and Three.', ""We are satisfied that the trial justice conducted the proper analysis in ruling on the defendant’s motion for a new trial. Nothing in the record leads us to conclude that the trial justice was either clearly wrong or that she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence in her denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Clay, 79 A.3d at 842; Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 103.

Alba (Alba) petitioned this Court to review a decision of the Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education (Board of Regents). The Board of Regents affirmed a decision of the Commissioner of Education which upheld the Cranston School Committee’s vote to reject a recommendation to renew Alba’s employment contract. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decision of the Board of Regents.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Alba was appointed in the beginning of the 2007-2008 school year to serve as Principal of Glen Hills Elementary School in Cranston, Rhode Island. Thereafter, Alba and the Cranston School Committee entered into an employment contract (contract) for the following school year. The contract ran from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 and provided the following with regard to renewal:', '-1-', '“The parties hereto may, by mutual agreement in writing,', 'extend or renew this contract for additional periods * * *.

The letter also informed Alba that he could request the committee’s discussion of his contract be held in open session, but Alba did not make such a request. At the December meeting, Superintendent M. Richard Scherza recommended renewal of Alba’s contract for an additional year. 1 Committee member Frank Lombardi stated that he would support continuing Alba’s employment for an additional year, provided that Alba was assigned to a different school. The representative for the ward containing Glen Hills School, committee member Andrea Iannazzi, voiced her opposition to renewing Alba’s contract.', 'After the chairman of the committee suggested that more time be taken to consider Alba’s contract, the committee agreed to withdraw the resolution recommending renewal.', 'The committee continued its discussion of Alba’s employment at its meeting on March 16, 2009. At the March meeting, Superintendent Scherza informed the committee that Alba was 1', 'Our discussion of events taking place during the committee’s executive sessions is based upon the summaries of those sessions contained in the record.', '-2- amenable to transferring schools. He stressed that Alba was a “good educator” under whose leadership writing scores had improved. Member Iannazzi opined, however, that renewing Alba’s contract for another year would be “postponing the inevitable.” 2 The committee again took no action on Alba’s contract. Sometime during that same month, Superintendent Scherza completed an evaluation of Alba’s performance as principal. He rated Alba as either “proficient” or “adequate” in all areas but noted several ways in which Alba needed to improve his performance. 3', 'On April 20, 2009, the committee took up consideration of Alba’s contract for the third time. The committee discussed Alba’s contract in executive session 4 and then voted six-to-one in open session to reject Superintendent Scherza’s renewal recommendation. Immediately after voting on Alba’s contract, the committee—still in open session—considered a recommendation not to renew the contract of another principal at a different elementary school. During the discussion that ensued, member Lombardi compared Alba’s case to the other principal’s case by remarking that “he voted * * * the way he did [on Alba’s renewal] because of what he saw as a significant amount of evidence suggesting that [Alba] is not prepared or equipped for the job of a principal,” whereas “he had not had that kind of information submitted to him in any way, shape or form regarding [the other principal].”', 'The chairman informed Alba of the committee’s vote by letter dated May 8, 2009. In an explanation of the committee’s decision, the chairman wrote, “[t]he reason for this action is that 2', 'The summary of the minutes from the committee’s executive session on March 16, 2009 is brief, but it states that the committee engaged in “[a] lengthy discussion * * * regarding the overall performance of” Alba. 3', 'There were four possible scores for each area under evaluation: “Distinguished,” “Proficient,” “Adequate” or “Unsatisfactory.” 4', 'The two-paragraph summary of the executive session minutes from April 20, 2009 does not reveal the substance of the committee’s discussion.', '-3- there are more qualified individuals available to better meet the needs of the District.” The letter also advised Alba that he was entitled to a prompt hearing “prior to the School Committee taking a final action of not renewing your contract[.]” Alba notified the committee of his intent to exercise his right to a hearing and requested that the committee provide him with certain information that he felt he needed to prepare for the hearing. In particular, Alba requested that the committee “identify the individual or individuals who provided the information upon which [it] relied in non-renewing * * * Alba’s contract.” He further asked for two specific witnesses to be made available to testify at the hearing. In the weeks leading up to the hearing, Alba’s counsel made additional requests by email for information about the committee’s vote, including any records of the executive session at the April 20, 2009 meeting and a copy of his personnel file. In response, the committee’s counsel confirmed that the requested witnesses would be available and provided Alba with a copy of his personnel file.', 'The committee’s counsel informed Alba, however, that he was not entitled to the minutes from the committee’s executive sessions, emphasizing that there was no right to discovery in advance of the hearing. 5', 'The committee held a hearing on the nonrenewal of Alba’s contract on June 30, 2009, the evening before the contract was due to expire. Member Iannazzi and member Janice Ruggieri, acting on the advice of the committee’s counsel, recused themselves from participating in the 5', 'On June 9, 2009, prior to the hearing, Alba filed a complaint in Kent County Superior Court seeking, inter alia, declaratory and injunctive relief. In an order entered on September 1, 2009, a Superior Court justice denied Alba’s request for a preliminary injunction. In that order, the Superior Court justice found that the committee had not violated Alba’s rights under the School Administrators’ Rights Act.', '-4- hearing.', 'Member Lombardi declined to recuse himself despite Alba’s insistence that his comments at the April 20, 2009 meeting evinced a disqualifying bias. 6', 'When the hearing commenced, Alba’s counsel requested a continuance, citing the committee’s failure to provide him with the information he had been seeking. He renewed his requests for the executive session minutes from the committee’s discussions of Alba’s employment and any documentation that the committee may have relied upon in reaching its decision that there were others with qualifications superior to Alba’s. Counsel asserted that, without this information, he could not effectively represent Alba at the hearing. In response, the committee’s counsel 7 objected to Alba’s request for a continuance, reasoning that Alba was not entitled to any of the information that he was seeking. The hearing officer denied Alba’s requests for a continuance and for information.', 'After the hearing officer’s ruling, Alba and his counsel left the hearing under protest that the process was fundamentally unfair. The committee’s counsel then proceeded to call three witnesses. Judith Lundsten, the executive director of educational programs and services, averred that she had received complaints about Alba from at least two parents. Peter Nero, the then- assistant superintendent, also testified about complaints that he had received from parents concerning Alba’s performance as principal. Superintendent Scherza, in contrast, opined that Alba would make a “good principal” if given a chance. At the close of the hearing, the 6', 'Before the hearing opened, several parents who were in attendance that evening came forward to express their support for Alba. Alba’s counsel also submitted written endorsements of Alba which he suggested should have been included in Alba’s personnel file. 7', 'During the hearing, the committee’s counsel appears to have fulfilled a quasi-prosecutorial role by presenting witnesses and arguing in opposition to Alba’s counsel. Another individual was responsible for making legal rulings. We refer to the latter individual as the “hearing officer;” and, for the sake of consistency, we continue to refer to the committee’s usual counsel as the “committee’s counsel.”', '-5- committee voted three-to-one to uphold its April 20, 2009 decision rejecting the recommendation to renew Alba’s contract.', 'Alba appealed the committee’s decision to the Commissioner of Education (commissioner). In lieu of holding a hearing, Alba and the committee submitted an agreed statement of facts and legal memoranda. Alba also supplemented the record with a copy of his evaluation. In a written decision issued on August 3, 2010, the commissioner concluded that Alba had received all the process to which he was entitled under both the contract and the School Administrators’ Rights Act. She specifically concluded that the chairman’s May 8, 2009 letter provided Alba with adequate notice of the reason for the committee’s initial vote. Although she acknowledged that “there is a great deal of logic to” Alba’s argument that he needed discovery to prepare for the hearing, the commissioner ultimately rejected this argument. Accordingly, the commissioner denied and dismissed Alba’s appeal.', 'Alba exercised his right under G.L. 1956 § 16-39-3 to appeal the commissioner’s decision to the Board of Regents. In his appeal, Alba challenged the committee’s nonrenewal of his contract on multiple grounds. He argued, inter alia, that (1) the committee lacked the statutory authority to nonrenew his contract; (2) the chairman’s May 8, 2009 letter was invalid; (3) member Lombardi improperly refused to recuse himself at the hearing; and (4) the committee deprived him of his right to prehearing discovery.', 'The Board of Regents rejected Alba’s arguments in a written decision issued on February 2, 2012. The board concluded that the committee had the authority to withhold its consent to the superintendent’s recommendation to renew.', 'It also agreed with the commissioner that the committee had fully respected all of Alba’s procedural rights and that the committee was under', '-6- no obligation to afford Alba the information he had requested in advance of the hearing. The board therefore affirmed the commissioner’s decision.', 'Alba petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Board of Regents. On September 6, 2012, we granted Alba’s petition.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When this Court reviews a decision of the Board of Regents by way of a petition for certiorari, we confine ourselves to an examination of the record for alleged errors of law.

Although we afford deference when a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and the agency charged with its enforcement has given an interpretation that is not clearly erroneous or unauthorized, we retain “final responsibility for statutory construction[.]” Asadoorian v. Warwick School Committee, 691 A.2d 573, 577 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Gallison v. Bristol School Committee, 493 A.2d 164, 166 (R.I. 1985)). “It is not our function to review the lower tribunal’s findings of fact when there is competent evidence to support th[o]se findings.” D’Ambra v.

He also alleges that the committee’s nonrenewal of his contract suffered from multiple procedural infirmities and irregularities that were so severe as', '-7- to deprive him of his rights under the Administrators’ Rights Act. We address separately each of Alba’s arguments. 8', 'A', 'Renewal Clause of the Contract', 'Alba argues that the clause of his contract providing for automatic nonrenewal is inconsistent with the Administrators’ Rights Act and, is therefore, invalid. In Alba’s opinion, the renewal clause was an unlawful attempt on the part of the committee to deprive him of his right to a hearing.', 'The plain language of the contract, however, belies Alba’s assertion that the committee was attempting to circumvent the Administrators’ Rights Act. The renewal clause specifically preserves Alba’s rights under the act.', 'That clause states that “[n]othing contained in this agreement shall alter the Administrator’s rights under R.I.G.L [§] 16-12.1-3, or otherwise under R.I.G.L. [§§] 16-12.1-1. et seq.” Under § 16-12.1-3, an administrator is entitled to a hearing before the committee “[p]rior to [the committee’s] taking final action dismissing or not renewing the employment of [the] administrator.” In this case, the committee afforded Alba a hearing on 8', 'Although Alba’s allegations of error are largely procedural, he does make one argument attacking the substance of the committee’s decision as arbitrary and capricious. He specifically points to the fact that the committee renewed the contract of another principal at a different school and suggests that the committee acted arbitrarily by not affording him the same opportunity that it afforded the other principal to improve his performance. We succinctly address this argument by noting that an agency’s differing treatment of different individuals does not generally amount to arbitrariness, provided that the record discloses a reasoned basis for the distinction. See Mill Realty Associates v. Crowe, 841 A.2d 668, 675 (R.I. 2004); accord McKenzie v. Webster Parish School Board, 609 So.2d 1028, 1032 (La. Ct. App. 1992) (finding renewal of other teachers at other schools irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim of arbitrariness). Here, the committee’s discussion of the other principal’s contract at its April 20, 2009 meeting spans nearly nine single-spaced pages of the record.', 'Those pages disclose several understandable reasons for the committee’s decision to renew the other principal’s contract. In particular, the committee found it significant that the other principal, in contrast to Alba, never received a formal evaluation.', '-8- June 30, 2009, after its initial vote not to renew his contract on April 30, 2009 but, significantly, prior to taking a final vote.', 'Nothing in the Administrators’ Rights Act prohibits automatic nonrenewal. The absence of such a prohibition in the provisions governing administrators’ employment may be contrasted with the provisions governing teachers’ employment, which specifically command that “[t]eaching service shall be on the basis of an annual contract” which “shall be deemed to be continuous unless the governing body of the schools shall notify the teacher in writing on or before March 1 that the contract for the ensuing year will not be renewed * * *.” General Laws 1956 § 16-13-2. The Legislature therefore knows how to call for automatic renewal. If it desired the same measure for administrators, it could have directed as such in the provisions of the Administrators’ Rights Act. See In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 525 (R.I. 2011) (reasoning that “the General Assembly knew how to require a net-benefit test when it wanted the [Public Utilities] [C]ommission to use that type of analysis”); Rubano v. DiCenzo, 759 A.2d 959, 969 (R.I. 2000). Accordingly, we conclude that nothing in the language of the contract’s renewal clause, or the committee’s implementation of that clause, deprived Alba of his rights under the Administrators’ Rights Act.', 'B', 'Committee’s Authority Not to Renew the Contract', 'Alba next argues that the committee lacked the authority to nonrenew his contract. Alba views the committee’s statutory role as limited to ratifying the hiring decisions of the superintendent. He took the position at the committee hearing, and maintains the same position before this Court, that nonrenewal may only be effectuated upon the recommendation of the superintendent not to renew. We disagree.', '-9-', 'The Legislature has clearly vested the committee with authority to choose the administrators who will run its schools.', 'The general powers and duties of local school committees include entering into contracts and giving “advice and consent on the appointment by the superintendent of all school department personnel.” General Laws 1956 § 16-2-9(a)(13) and (18).', 'Moreover, in the statement of purposes for the Administrators’ Rights Act, the Legislature declared its intent that the protections afforded in that chapter not “interfere with the discretion of school committees to choose those who shall administer local schools * * *.” Section 16-12.1-1. Consistent with these statutory provisions, Alba and the committee entered into a one-year employment agreement that explicitly gave the committee the right to decline to renew Alba’s contract. Provided that it afforded Alba notice and a hearing, the committee was free to exercise that contractual right by voting against the superintendent’s recommendation to renew.', 'Alba has not pointed to any statutory or contractual language to support his assertion that nonrenewal may be accomplished only after a recommendation from the superintendent for nonrenewal. We will not read such a limit into either the contract or the relevant statutory provisions. In rejecting a similar argument that a school board may not veto a superintendent’s recommendation to renew, another court has astutely observed that “[i]f * * * [a b]oard [must] reemploy all probationary teachers whom the superintendent recommends for reemployment * * * the [b]oard[’s] vote upon the teacher’s reemployment * * * becomes meaningless. A board bound to conform to the superintendent’s recommendations is merely a rubber stamp.” Taylor v. Crisp, 212 S.E.2d 381, 385 (N.C. 1975); see also Richardson v. Terry, 893 So.2d 277, 285, 286 (Ala. 2004) (rejecting argument that nontenured teacher could be nonrenewed only upon recommendation of the superintendent where statute governing nonrenewals did not require', '- 10 - superintendent’s recommendation). Similarly, if we were to adopt Alba’s position that the committee must accept a recommendation for renewal, the committee’s role under the act in taking a final vote on an administrator’s employment would be reduced to that of a rubber stamp. We therefore agree with the board that the committee acted within its authority when it voted against the superintendent’s recommendation to renew Alba’s contract.', 'C', 'Committee Member’s Failure to Recuse', 'Alba argues that member Lombardi’s participation in the June 30, 2009 hearing deprived him of his right to a hearing before a fair and impartial tribunal. He points to Lombardi’s statement during the open session of the April 20, 2009 committee meeting that “he voted * * * [against Alba] because of what he saw as a significant amount of evidence suggesting that [Alba] is not prepared or equipped for the job of a principal.”', 'This statement, Alba asserts, demonstrates that Lombardi had already formed a belief about Alba’s incompetence before the hearing. Alba concludes that Lombardi’s remark evinced a disqualifying bias.', 'The statutory scheme set forth in the Administrators’ Rights Act necessarily contemplates that the committee members will have formed an opinion about the renewal of an administrator’s contract before the hearing takes place. Section 16-12.1-3 of the act dictates that “[p]rior to taking final action * * * not renewing the employment of an administrator,” the committee must provide the administrator with a written statement of the bases or reasons for the nonrenewal and notify the administrator of his or her right to a prompt hearing. In analyzing a similar statutory scheme which governs the nonrenewal of nontenured teachers, 9 we observed that the post-notice 9', 'The provision at issue in Jacob v. Board of Regents, 117 R.I. 164, 167, 365 A.2d 430, 432 (1976), entitled nontenured teachers to a “statement of cause” for nonrenewal and a hearing before the full school committee.', '- 11 - hearing affords a “teacher who has already been acquainted with the reasons why a board of education has decided not to renew his contract a full and fair opportunity to persuade and convince the board that it is mistaken in that decision.” 10 Jacob v. Board of Regents for Education, 117 R.I. 164, 170, 365 A.2d 430, 433 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore explained that, at the hearing, “the committee * * * ha[s] a duty to listen to a dissatisfied teacher in an objective manner and fairly consider its original decision.” Id. at 171, 365 A.2d at 434. Rhode Island is not alone in allowing school committees to play overlapping roles by both initiating proceedings to end teachers’ employment and making the final decision. Courts faced with comparable provisions have reached similar conclusions that the impartiality required under such a statutory scheme is not the avoidance of forming an initial opinion, but rather the willingness to fairly reconsider that opinion. Put somewhat differently, “[u]nless there is evidence that preformed opinions of board members are fixed and unchangeable, or that in the deliberations after hearing all the evidence, the result was dictated by such a preformed opinion, the [employee] cannot successfully maintain that he was deprived of a fair and impartial hearing.” Kizer v. Dorchester County Vocational Education Board of Trustees, 340 S.E.2d 144, 148 (S.C. 1986); accord Hubbard v. Board of Education, 882 P.2d 483, 487-88 (Kan. Ct. App. 1994); Palmer v. Van Buren R-1 Board of Education, 872 S.W.2d 590, 593 (Mo. Ct. App. 1994) (“The critical inquiry is whether a review of the record ‘indicates that the board of education’s prior knowledge * * * resulted in an irrevocable commitment on its part to terminate [the teacher], regardless of what the evidence at the hearing, pro or con, might reveal * * *.’” 10', 'We also described the nonrenewal hearing as “not quasi-judicial in nature.” Jacob, 117 R.I. at 171, 365 A.2d at 434. Alba’s description of the committee as “a quasi-judicial hearing board” is therefore inaccurate.', '- 12 - (quoting Cochran v. Board of Education of Mexico School District No. 59, 815 S.W.2d 55, 63 (Mo. Ct. App. 1991)).', 'Our review of the record discloses no evidence which would tend to suggest that Lombardi was unable to fairly reconsider his original decision not to renew Alba’s contract. His statement at the April 20, 2009 meeting was no more than an explanation of his initial vote. When Lombardi later declined to recuse himself at the June 30, 2009 hearing, he avowed that he had not prejudged the case and that he could keep an open mind. At the close of the hearing, he indicated that his second vote had been based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at the hearing. We are therefore satisfied that Lombardi’s refusal to recuse himself did not deprive Alba of his right to a fair hearing.', 'D', 'Requests for Discovery', 'Alba advances several arguments concerning the committee’s denial of his requests for prehearing discovery. The general thrust of Alba’s claims is that the lack of discovery deprived him of his right to a meaningful hearing under the act. He acknowledges that there is no right to prehearing discovery under the act, but he urges us to imply such a right. Alba perceives the committee’s denial of his discovery requests as a deliberate attempt to insulate itself from hearing his “side of the story.” He particularly asserts that without discovery he could not effectively cross-examine witnesses at the hearing or erase any harmful innuendo that had attached to his nonrenewal.', 'As Alba concedes, he has no express right to discovery. There were, however, several other avenues for obtaining information and building a record that Alba chose not to pursue. Alba was informed by letter before each of the three committee meetings that he could request', '- 13 - that his employment be discussed in open session. He did not respond to any of the letters or show any interest in the committee’s proceedings until he received the chairman’s May 8, 2009 letter informing him of the committee’s vote.', 'More significantly, Alba and his counsel then refused to participate in the June 30, 2009 hearing. The hearing before the school committee is the primary mechanism under the act for an administrator to ensure that his or her employment is not being ended for impermissible reasons and “to erase harmful innuendo from any suspension, dismissal, or nonrenewal.” Section 16- 12.1-1. The administrator, with the assistance of counsel, has a right to present and cross- examine witnesses at the hearing. See § 16-12.1-4. From our perspective, it was Alba’s own actions in abandoning the hearing, rather than any deliberate attempt at obstruction on the part of the committee, that deprived him of the ability to cross-examine witnesses or remove innuendo from his nonrenewal. We find further support for this conclusion in the fact that the committee’s counsel did cooperate with several of Alba’s prehearing requests. Although it is not entirely clear why the committee did not oblige Alba’s request for the minutes, 11 the record indicates that Alba requested and was provided with a copy of his personnel file in advance of the hearing. Alba also specifically requested that the committee make Ms. Lundsten and Superintendent Scherza available as witnesses for the hearing. Alba was assured by the committee’s counsel in advance of the hearing that both individuals would be in attendance, and in fact, both Ms. Lundsten and Superintendent Scherza testified at the hearing. Alba and his counsel, however, walked out of the hearing without making any attempt to examine either witness. If Alba disagreed with the hearing officer’s rulings about discovery, a more appropriate response would 11', 'Alba eventually received a copy of the executive session minutes sometime after the June 30, 2009 hearing but before he submitted his memorandum in support of his appeal to the commissioner.', '- 14 - have been to place his objection on the record and continue to the best of his ability with the presentation of evidence. In the event that Alba had participated in the proceedings before the committee and still believed that he needed additional information, he had the opportunity for a de novo hearing before the commissioner. See Slattery v. School Committee of Cranston, 116 R.I. 252, 262, 354 A.2d 741, 746 (1976) (one who appeals to the commissioner is entitled to “a de novo hearing” and not “merely a review of [the] school committee action”). At that stage, he could have availed himself of the commissioner’s broad powers to subpoena documents. 12 Alba elected to forgo the hearing before the commissioner in favor of relying upon a stipulated set of facts.', 'While we acknowledge that Alba’s request for the minutes was not unreasonable and we understand that an administrator may have valid concerns about his or her employment being discussed in open session, we nonetheless cannot say that an administrator who makes an earnest effort to utilize the procedures available will be deprived of meaningful process if he or she is not also afforded a right to prehearing discovery. Accordingly, we are constrained to conclude that in the instant case, any lack of meaningful process was the result of Alba’s refusal to participate, rather than the actions of the committee.', 'E', 'Letter of Nonrenewal', 'Alba additionally questions the chairman’s authority to author the May 8, 2009 letter which informed him that the committee had voted to nonrenew his contract. He does not challenge the validity of the committee’s reasons.', 'Instead, Alba claims that the chairman 12', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-39-8, the commissioner has the power to issue subpoenas to compel the production of documents for any hearing conducted within the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. “Subpoenas shall * * * be issued by the commissioner or hearing officer at the request of any party participating in any hearing.” Id.', '- 15 - exceeded his authority by unilaterally selecting a reason for nonrenewal which was not agreed upon by the full committee as “the reason” for nonrenewal.', 'We cannot agree with the proposition that the chairman strayed beyond the bounds of his authority by distilling the committee’s lengthy and varied discussions into a summary of its reasons. In this particular context, the Legislature has explicitly called for concision: Section 16-12.1-3 requires the committee to “provide the affected administrator with: (1) a concise, clear, written statement, privately communicated, of the bases or reasons for the * * * nonrenewal, and (2) notification of the right of the administrator to a prompt hearing * * *.” (Emphasis added.) The May 8, 2009 letter complied with all of these statutory requirements and the chairman was clearly empowered to author that letter since he is endowed with the statutory authority to “sign any orders and official papers” on behalf of the committee. See § 16-2-6. As a practical matter, the chairman could not reasonably be expected to recount at length the substance of the committee’s three discussions. Some synthesis and summarization was necessary. To the extent Alba is suggesting that he was entitled, in advance of the hearing, to a full account of the committee’s discussions, this suggestion essentially amounts to another iteration of the discovery argument which we have already considered in our foregoing discussion.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the decision of the Board of Regents. The record shall be remanded to the Board of Education 13 with our decision endorsed thereon. 13', 'After the Board of Regents issued its decision in this case, the Legislature merged the Board of Regents into the “Board of Education.” See P.L. 2012, ch. 241, art. 4, § 3.', '- 16 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'David J.

On February 18, 2011, a hearing was held in the Superior Court on the counterclaim defendants’ motion for a new trial; that motion was denied.', 'We shall next proceed to discuss the significant testimony and other evidence from the slander of title trial.', 'At trial, Paul Hogan, a real estate appraiser who was qualified as an expert, testified on behalf of the counterclaimants as to the highest value attained by each of the properties at issue between November 15, 2002, when the notices of lis pendens were filed, and February 2, 2009, when clear title to the properties was restored; he also testified as to the value of the properties at the end of that period, in February of 2009. He testified that the value of the property located at Bellevue Avenue in Newport was $1,835,000 in February of 2009 and $2,310,000 at its highest value, in September of 2005. According to Mr. Hogan’s testimony, the value of the property located at Prospect Hill Street in Newport was $200,000 in February of 2009 and $250,000 at its highest value, in September of 2005; he added that the value of the property located on Post Road in Warwick was $320,000 in February of 2009 and $365,000 at its highest value, in September of 2005. Finally, Mr. Hogan testified that the value of the River Farm Condominium located in West Warwick was $280,000 in February of 2009 and $340,000 at its highest value, in September of 2005. The counterclaim defendants did not object to Mr. Hogan’s testimony at any point.', 'Attorney Voccola, the executor of the estate of Frederick Jr., testified that the notices of lis pendens prevented him from consummating a transaction at a time when he was offered two and a half million dollars to sell two of the properties at issue.5 He also stated that he did not 5', 'John R.

I thought I could get it back.” Frederick Sr. further indicated in his testimony that he wanted to get the properties back because he did not have any additional properties to provide to his other three children. The trial justice referred to these statements made by Frederick Sr. as “telling and determinative” with respect to his eventual ruling. Specifically, the trial justice found Frederick Sr.’s testimony to reflect a clear indication that he had not filed suit “to establish and recover property rightfully his, rather he filed suit to collect a debt that he believed arose in 1998 when [Frederick Jr.] sold” a fifth property (located on Malbone Road in Newport) which was not a subject of this dispute.6 at trial was “not credible.” In the words of the trial justice, Mr. Gullison had merely engaged in “tire-kicking,” which the trial justice found “not to have been a real effort to purchase the property.” 6', 'With respect to the property located at Malbone Road in Newport, the trial justice found that Frederick Sr. purchased the property in 1987 and ultimately transferred title of the property to Frederick Jr. for no consideration in 1990. Then, according to the trial justice’s findings of fact, Fredrick Jr. “sold the Malbone Parcel without Frederick Carrozza, Sr.’s knowledge or consent on or about March 18, 19[9]8.” The trial justice further found that, “[w]ithout Frederick Carrozza, Sr.’s knowledge or consent, Frederick Carrozza, Jr. kept the net proceeds of the sale of the Malbone Parcel and used those proceeds for his own benefit, specifically to pay off a margin call to Charles Schwab following a decline in the value of the Oxford Health Company stock which was owned by [Frederick Jr.] at the time.” The trial justice also found that the sale of the property located at Malbone Road was “[the] main factor that caused an estrangement between Frederick Carrozza, Sr. and Frederick Carrozza, Jr.,” which was not resolved prior to Frederick Jr.’s death.', 'It is important to note that, with respect to the four properties actually at issue in this case, this Court, in its earlier decision, recognized that Frederick Sr. had “testified that he had', '-5-', 'After the trial had concluded, the trial justice found in favor of the counterclaimants and held that Frederick Sr., as well as his three living children (see infra), were liable for slander of title. The counterclaimants were awarded compensatory damages of $630,000; in addition, they were awarded prejudgment interest from the date the suit was filed in 2002, expenses of $24,080.40, and attorneys’ fees of $151,267.7 Frederick Sr. alone was found liable for punitive damages in the amount of $845,000. The trial justice based his calculation of compensatory damages upon the diminution in the value of the properties during the period of time when the notices of lis pendens were in place, which was measured by the difference between the highest value of the four properties at issue during that period of time (which occurred in September of 2005) and the value of the properties when clear title was restored in February of 2009. He stated that over that period “each of the properties lost substantial value.”', 'Frederick Sr.’s living children were not parties to the lawsuit in 2002 at the time the notices of lis pendens were filed.', 'The trial justice determined that, thereafter, Phillip “voluntarily” joined the case, whereas Freida and Laurie were joined as necessary parties.8 The contributed part of the purchase price” of both the property located at Bellevue Avenue in Newport and the property located at Post Road in Warwick, but that he had provided “conflicting accounts about” those acquisitions.

Accordingly, the trial justice found that Frederick Sr.’s living children were also liable for slander of title along with their father; the basis for that ruling was the trial justice’s determination that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie “[were] not unwilling participants in the lawsuit.” He reasoned that they had “clearly stood with their hands outstretched, waiting for a decision of this [c]ourt that would place [Frederick Jr.’s] property in those outstretched hands.”', 'After judgment had been entered, the counterclaim defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.

First, the counterclaim defendants contend that the trial justice misconceived Frederick Sr.’s testimony regarding his reasons for bringing the lawsuit and overlooked evidence in the course of finding that the counterclaimants had proven their slander of title claim. Second, the counterclaim defendants argue that the trial justice erred in basing the amount of compensatory damages upon the diminution of the property values between 2005 and 2009 because, according to the counterclaim defendants, there was no evidence that the counterclaimants had a buyer for any of the properties or that any actual loss was incurred. Instead, the counterclaim defendants urge that, if the finding of liability is upheld, this Court should hold that the damages must be based upon the difference in the value of the properties between the time the notices of lis pendens were filed in 2002 and the time at which clear title was restored in 2009; they contend that, under this valuation method, the properties would be deemed not to have lost any value. Third, the made a reference to the testimony of Frederick Sr., which the counterclaim defendants did not “believe” was “accurate.”', 'The trial justice denied the motion for a new trial, stating that the counterclaim defendants “[did] not allege that there exist[ed] an error of law” at trial, but that they were instead suggesting that “[the] [c]ourt either reconsider its findings or take evidence so that the []counterclaim defendants [could] persuade the [c]ourt to change its mind.” According to the trial justice, granting the counterclaim defendants’ motion for a new trial would not be a “proper use of Rule 59.”', 'The counterclaim defendants filed an amended notice of appeal, indicating that they were also appealing the denial of their new trial motion. However, in their briefs before this Court, the counterclaim defendants make no meaningful argument with respect to the denial of their motion for a new trial. As such, that issue has not been properly raised, and we shall consider it no further. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n. 1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”); see also RBS Citizens Bank, N.A. v. Issler, 21 A.3d 293, 298-99 (R.I. 2011).', '-8- counterclaim defendants argue that the trial justice erred in awarding prejudgment interest from the date the suit was filed, rather than from the date of injury, which the trial justice found to be when the properties reached their peak market value in September of 2005. Additionally, the counterclaim defendants contend that the trial justice erred in holding Phillip, Freida, and Laurie liable for slander of title in view of the fact that they were not part of the lawsuit at the time the notices of lis pendens were filed. They further contend that the trial justice erred in finding that Frederick Sr. had the ability to pay punitive damages because the trial justice “failed to take [Frederick Sr.’s] current financial condition into account” when assessing punitive damages. (Emphasis in original.) Finally, the counterclaim defendants posit that the amount of punitive damages awarded was excessive as a matter of law.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'It should be borne in mind that the instant case was tried before a trial justice sitting without a jury; accordingly, we recall the basic principle of appellate jurisprudence that “[t]his Court views deferentially the factual findings of a trial justice sitting in a nonjury case.” Manchester v.

Moreover, the counterclaim defendants argue that the notices of lis pendens were not filed to thwart development of the properties or to harm Frederick Jr.’s estate, but rather were filed only to benefit the counterclaim defendants; on that basis, they argue that the trial justice erred when he found them liable for slander of title.', 'The counterclaim defendants further posit that the trial justice misconceived critical testimony when he found that “Frederick Sr. just wanted his money back on the Malbone Road property.” Specifically, they argue that the trial justice erroneously determined that Frederick Sr.’s testimony with respect to his reasons for bringing suit was in reference to the money owed to him for the Malbone Road property; according to the counterclaim defendants, Frederick Sr. was actually referring to the money he allegedly contributed to the purchase of the properties at issue. Finally, the counterclaim defendants aver that the trial justice impermissibly shifted the burden of proof off the counterclaimants and onto them. With respect to the latter contention, they point to the trial justice’s requirement that Frederick Sr. “produce old financial records” to support his testimony that he contributed to the purchase price of the properties at issue; they then point to the trial justice’s subsequent finding that, “[a]t trial no evidence was produced that Frederick Carrozza, Sr. contributed to the purchase of any of the properties in question.” The counterclaim defendants argue that the trial justice should instead have required the', '- 13 - counterclaimants to “disprove” Frederick Sr.’s testimony regarding the purchase of the properties at issue by showing how Frederick Jr. paid for the properties.', 'To rebut the arguments made by the counterclaim defendants, the counterclaimants argue that malice can be found when notices of lis pendens are filed for a reason other than claiming an interest in the property, such as to thwart development or to try to collect a debt. They contend that the evidence at trial established that the notices of lis pendens in the instant case were filed “without a good faith belief in the truth of the predicate facts and for an improper purpose, namely, to collect a debt.” The counterclaimants point out in their brief that there was evidence that Frederick Jr. had access to funds by virtue of “banking relationships,” personal loans, and “trading stock;” moreover, they note that the properties were all in Frederick Jr.’s name. For these reasons, the counterclaimants urge this Court to affirm the decision of the trial justice.', 'In a well-reasoned and thorough decision, the trial justice made forty-seven findings of fact and then proceeded to apply the law to those findings of fact, ultimately holding the counterclaim defendants liable for slander of title. He stated in pertinent part as follows:', '“The [c]ourt finds that the counterclaimants have proved by a fair', 'preponderance of the evidence that Frederick Carrozza, Sr. not', 'only had no good faith basis in claiming that he owned any of [the]', 'properties [at issue], either legally or equitably, but also, as he', 'stated in his own words in his testimony, he recorded the lis', 'pendens not to protect a legitimate property interest but to recover', 'money he believed to be owed to him by Frederick, Jr. and', 'therefore he acted with legal malice, as that term is used in the', 'context of a slander of title action.” In reaching his conclusion, the trial justice relied specifically on this Court’s decisions in Montecalvo v. Mandarelli, 682 A.2d 918 (R.I. 1996), Peckham v. Hirschfeld, 570 A.2d 663 (R.I. 1990), DeLeo v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc., 546 A.2d 1344 (R.I. 1988), and Hopkins v. Drowne, 21 R.I. 20, 41 A. 567 (1898). The trial justice referenced the fact that Frederick Sr. gave two', '- 14 - separate and inconsistent accounts relative to the transfer of the Malbone Road property to Frederick Jr. The trial justice found neither account provided by Frederick Sr. to be true; rather the trial justice found that Frederick Sr. had transferred that property in order to protect it “in the event of a claim against [him] resulting from [an] * * * altercation” in which he was involved. In fact, the trial justice found that “much of the testimony at trial by [Frederick Sr.] was a knowing fabrication.” The trial justice attributed Frederick Sr.’s “ill will” toward his son to Frederick Jr.’s sale of the Malbone Road property; in discussing Frederick Sr.’s “ill will” toward his son, the trial justice further referenced Frederick Sr.’s belief that Frederick Jr. had married and had adopted a daughter “to spite him.” Despite his finding that Frederick Sr.’s testimony was largely not credible, the trial justice detected “one shining moment of truth”—namely, when Frederick Sr. was asked by his attorney why he filed suit and he replied: “[I]t was my money and I thought I could get it back.” In reaching his final conclusion, the trial justice stated:', '“[Frederick Sr.’s] own admission and clear declaration of his', 'motive for filing the lis pendens and the lawsuit is telling and', 'determinative to this [c]ourt’s ruling.

The nonmovants in the first Carrozza opinion were the individuals to whom we refer in the instant appeal as the counterclaim defendants (namely, Frederick Sr. and his living children). Carrozza, 962 A.2d at 77. As such, there is no conflict between our statement in the first Carrozza opinion with regard to the Bellevue Avenue and Post Road properties and the trial justice’s factual findings following the trial on the counterclaimants’ slander of title claim. Accordingly, we shall treat the trial justice’s finding of fact that Frederick Sr. produced no evidence to show that he contributed to the purchase of the properties at issue with our usual deference. See Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1011 (R.I. 2007); see also Grady v.

It was within the trial justice’s discretion to credit the evidence showing that Frederick Jr. bought the properties on his own and to discredit Frederick Sr.’s testimony that he contributed to the purchase prices of the properties. See D’Ellena v. Town of East Greenwich, 21 A.3d 389, 392 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]e accord a substantial amount of deference to [the credibility] determinations [of a trial justice], due to the fact that the trial justice has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and * * * has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hopkins, 21 R.I. at 23, 41 A. at 568 (“[Malice] is that feeling of personal hostility or ill-will towards another which only manifests itself in language or conduct, and hence is best shown by the character of the language or conduct.

In our judgment, there are no grounds for this Court to disturb that finding.', 'The counterclaim defendants also take issue with the trial justice’s finding that Frederick Sr.’s testimony was largely not credible, except when he gave the following response to his own', ""- 18 - attorney's inquiry at trial as to why he initiated the lawsuit in the first place: “It was my money and I thought I could get it back.” The trial justice characterized the latter statement as a “shining moment of truth” and found that, when Frederick Sr. referred to getting his money back, he was referring to the Malbone Road property—as opposed to any of the four properties at issue in the instant case.13 That finding contributed to the trial justice’s conclusion that Frederick Sr. acted with malice when he filed the notices of lis pendens. The counterclaim defendants argue that Frederick Sr.’s statement about getting his money back was in fact a reference to the money he allegedly contributed to the purchase prices of the four properties in this case. However, the counterclaim defendants are unable to point to any definitive evidence to support that assertion; they direct this Court’s attention only to portions of Frederick Sr.’s testimony immediately before and after the above-quoted comment about getting his money back. The testimony which precedes and follows Frederick Sr.’s somewhat fog-shrouded reference to getting his money back does not provide enlightenment as to the property to which Frederick Sr. was referring. However, it was within the trial justice’s discretion to infer from that testimony that Frederick Sr. was referring to the Malbone Road property and, accordingly, to find that he acted with malice when he filed the notices of lis pendens. See Peckham, 570 A.2d at 667. After carefully scrutinizing the record, we do not perceive anything in Frederick Sr.’s testimony that would lead us to rule that the trial justice was clearly wrong in his credibility determination. Moreover, the trial justice understandably accorded Frederick Sr.’s statement about getting his money back a great deal of attention; his credibility determination is entitled to deference from this Court. See 13"", 'The trial justice further found that Frederick Sr. had given two different accounts about the sale of the Malbone Road property and that he had not been candid about the reason he transferred that property to Frederick Jr. in the first place. These factual findings also add weight to the trial justice’s determination that Frederick Sr.’s testimony was not credible and that he acted with malice when he filed the notices of lis pendens.', '- 19 - Manchester, 926 A.2d at 1011; see also State v.

According to the counterclaim defendants, in view of the fact that there was no allegation that Frederick Sr.’s purpose in filing the notices of lis pendens was to thwart development, the trial justice’s reliance on this Court’s opinions in Montecalvo v. Mandarelli, 682 A.2d 918 (R.I. 1996), and DeLeo v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc., 546 A.2d 1344 (R.I. 1988), was in error. The counterclaim defendants are correct that in DeLeo this Court determined that filing a notice of lis pendens with the purpose of (in the trial justice’s language) “thwart[ing] the development of the property” was malicious. See DeLeo, 546 A.2d at 1346-47. However, neither our decision in DeLeo nor our decision in Montecalvo stands for the proposition that malice can be proven only by showing that the party who filed the notice of lis pendens did so in order “to thwart the development of the property.” See id.; see also Montecalvo, 682 A.2d at 923-25. In fact, in Montecalvo, where we upheld a finding by the trial justice that the plaintiff acted maliciously because, when filing the lis pendens, she was merely attempting to recoup an alleged debt, we expressly stated that “a lis pendens may not be used as a substitute for an attachment to collect an alleged indebtedness.” Montecalvo, 682 A.2d at 925; see also Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Howard, 240 S.W.3d 1, 4 (Tex. App. 2007) (“If the suit seeks a property interest only to secure', '- 20 - the recovery of damages or other relief that the plaintiff may be awarded, the interest is merely collateral and will not support a lis pendens.”). It was the trial justice’s determination that that was precisely what Frederick Sr. did in this case, and we perceive no clear error in that determination. Moreover, the counterclaim defendants’ attempt to circumvent the malice issue by claiming that Frederick Sr. could not have acted with malice when he filed the notice of lis pendens because he sought only to help himself and not to harm Frederick Jr.’s estate is a distinction without a difference. See Arnold Road Realty Associates, LLC, 873 A.2d at 126 (stating that malice is “established by showing that a party made a false statement, with full knowledge of its falsity, for the purpose of injuring the complainant(s)”) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Compensatory Damages', 'The first contention with respect to damages which the counterclaim defendants raise is that the trial justice used an inappropriate method of calculating the compensatory damages in this case. In addressing the counterclaim defendants’ argument, we find it helpful to begin by discussing how the trial justice awarded damages.', 'The trial justice made findings of fact with respect to the change in value of the four properties at issue during the time period in which they were subject to the notices of lis pendens. The trial justice’s findings of fact as to the value of the properties were derived from the', '- 21 - testimony of Mr. Hogan, a real estate appraiser. Mr. Hogan testified that the value of the property located at Bellevue Avenue in Newport was $1,835,000 in February of 2009, when the notices of lis pendens were removed, and $2,310,000 at its highest value, in September of 2005. According to Mr. Hogan’s testimony, the value of the property located at Prospect Hill Street in Newport was $200,000 in February of 2009 and $250,000 at its highest value, in September of 2005; he added that the value of the property located on Post Road in Warwick was $320,000 in 2009 and $365,000 at its highest value in 2005.', 'Finally, Mr. Hogan testified that the value of the River Farm Condominium located in West Warwick was $280,000 in February of 2009 and $340,000 at its highest value in 2005.', 'In order to determine the damages, the trial justice subtracted the value of the properties at the point in time when the notices of lis pendens were removed from their value at the time when the properties were at their highest value during the period in which they were subject to the notices of lis pendens. Using this formula he found that: (1) the Bellevue Avenue property had declined in value by $475,000; (2) the Prospect Hill Street property declined in value by $50,000; (3) the Post Road property declined in value by $45,000; 14 and (4) the River Farm Condominium declined in value by $60,000. Adding those numbers together, the trial justice arrived at a grand total of $630,000 in compensatory damages.15 14', 'We note that, in his findings of fact, the trial justice correctly articulated the values of the properties, as testified to by Mr. Hogan. However, when actually calculating the damages, he mistakenly stated that the February 2009 value of the Post Road property was $280,000 (instead of the correct value of $320,000), leading him to conclude that the damages should amount to $670,000. That discrepancy was corrected before a judgment was entered, and the judgment reflects the correct total of compensatory damages ($630,000). 15', 'The trial justice also awarded legal fees and expenses. He found the total legal fees to amount to $350,000—which amount he then “adjusted to reflect the legal fee structure in Rhode Island” and reduced the award to $151,267 plus expenses of $24,080.40. The legal fees and expenses that the trial justice awarded are not at issue in this appeal.', '- 22 -', 'On appeal, the counterclaim defendants contend that the trial justice should have calculated damages by comparing the value of the properties on the date the notices of lis pendens were filed (November 15, 2002) and the date they were removed (February 2, 2009). They point out that little evidence was submitted regarding the value of the properties on the date the notices of lis pendens were filed, but that what was elicited as to that issue in the cross- examination of Mr. Hogan indicated that the value was comparable to the value on the date the notices of lis pendens were removed. Thus, according to the counterclaim defendants, the counterclaimants failed to prove, as they were required to do, that they suffered any special damages or pecuniary loss. The counterclaim defendants argue that it would only be appropriate to calculate damages by comparing the highest value of the properties with their value when the notices of lis pendens were removed if there had been a “ready, willing, and able buyer[].” And they note that the trial justice found that the testimony of the only interested buyer was not credible and that the buyer had merely been engaging in “tire-kicking.” The counterclaim defendants further support their argument by pointing out that the counterclaimants enjoyed the profits of continued ownership of the properties (receiving rental income, for example) for the entire period during which they were subject to the notices of lis pendens.', 'The counterclaimants contend in their brief that it is “disingenuous” of the counterclaim defendants, “having employed every legal stratagem and tactic they could muster to prevent the [counterclaimants] from selling the properties, [to] now argue there was no real effort to sell the properties.”16 (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

In support of their argument, they direct this Court’s attention to the testimony of Attorney Michael Voccola (the executor of the estate of Frederick Jr.), who stated that he saw “no reason to go through the motions” of attempting to sell any of the properties when he could not “provide a clean, marketable and insurable title.” The counterclaimants argue that, as a result of the fact that the filing of the notices of lis pendens had rendered each of the properties unmarketable, they were not able to take advantage of rising market conditions in 2005. Moreover, they deem it important for this Court to bear in mind that the counterclaim defendants “thwarted” all attempts to quash the notices of lis pendens throughout the course of the proceedings in Superior Court, even after summary judgment had been awarded in the counterclaimants’ favor.', 'We note that determining the appropriate method to be used in calculating damages (as opposed to determining the amount of damages after the process of weighing the evidence and making credibility determinations) is a question of law; as such, we shall address that issue in a de novo manner.

The counterclaim defendants respond by arguing that they challenged the theory of valuation during their cross-examination of Mr. Hogan, in their post- trial memorandum, and in their “Motion for a New Trial or, in the Alternative, to Alter or Amend the Judgment under Rule 59.” Additionally, they state that Mr. Hogan testified only as to the value of the properties, not the method of calculating damages—so that any failure to object to Mr. Hogan’s testimony was not a waiver with respect to the issue of calculating the compensatory damages. We are in agreement with the counterclaim defendants.

Consequently, in order for counterclaimants to prove their slander of title claim, they were required to show that they incurred an actual injury as a result of the filing of the notices of lis pendens. The parties do not dispute that such an injury is required for damages to be awarded in a slander of title action; rather, they dispute how such an injury should be measured when determining whether it is sufficient to meet the requirement of special damages. Succinctly put, the counterclaim defendants are contending that any pecuniary loss based on the change in fair market value of the properties should be calculated by comparing the value of the properties on the date when the notices of lis pendens were filed with their value on the date when they were removed, unless there was evidence that a buyer existed who refused to purchase the property due to the notices of lis pendens; only in the latter situation, according to the counterclaim defendants, may a court calculate damages by looking to a date other than the date of filing and the date of removal of the notices of lis pendens.', 'After carefully reviewing the record in this case, it is our judgment that, in the context of this slander of title claim, the trial justice’s method of calculating damages was appropriate and, in contrast with the counterclaim defendants’ proposed system of calculating damages, properly accounted for the real harm suffered by the counterclaimants.17 We begin by noting that “[t]he 17', 'We are aware that some jurisdictions use the method of calculating pecuniary loss advocated by the counterclaim defendants.

In the instant case, if we were to follow the counterclaim defendants’ suggestion and use the date the notices of lis pendens were filed as the start date to determine damages, it would lead to a true inequity—namely, the quite likely18 result of no pecuniary loss being incurred by the counterclaimants in spite of the fact that the counterclaimants were most probably rendered unable to sell or refinance their property for a period of approximately seven years solely due to the malicious acts of the counterclaim defendants. 19 We decline to follow a method of calculating damages that could result in such inequity.20 18', 'We would note that, if we were to follow the counterclaim defendants’ proposed method of calculating damages, it is likely that that method would result in no pecuniary loss being incurred because, as the counterclaim defendants indicate, there was little evidence presented regarding the value of the properties on the date the notices of lis pendens were filed. 19', 'In our opinion in Montecalvo v.

Although the damages in Montecalvo appear to have been based on a comparison of the value of the property at the time the notice of lis pendens was filed and the value at the time of trial, we did not expressly endorse such a method of calculating damages in a slander of title case. Rather, we simply held that the jury’s determination of damages was reasonably supported by the evidence that the property at issue had changed in value from the date the notice of lis pendens was filed and the date of the trial.', 'Moreover, in Montecalvo we were tasked with determining whether the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial on the grounds that the defendant had failed to prove damages, was properly denied by the trial justice. Montecalvo, 682 A.2d at 929. The analysis required in that context is very different from what is required in the instant case. In this case, we must determine the proper method of calculating pecuniary loss in a slander of title action—whereas in Montecalvo we were called upon to determine whether the trial justice’s denial of the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial was clearly erroneous.

Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 38 A.3d', '- 27 -', 'Our confidence in our conclusion that the trial justice’s method for calculating pecuniary loss in this case was not erroneous is reinforced by our awareness of the fact that the counterclaim defendants committed an intentional tort which required the counterclaimants to show malice on the part of the counterclaim defendants—a not insignificant requirement, which the counterclaimants were able to meet. See Arnold Road Realty Associates, LLC v. Tiogue Fire District, 873 A.2d 119, 126 (R.I. 2005) (stating that the malice required for a slander of title claim is “an intent to deceive or injure”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Montecalvo v.

Moreover, our confidence in our decision is further buttressed by the fact that the counterclaimants were in fact injured.', 'The striking metaphorical language employed by the trial justice in addressing the issue of compensatory damages is noteworthy; in rendering his bench decision, he stated that “the properties were held hostage by the lis pendens.” (Emphasis added.)

If the notices of lis pendens had not been filed, the counterclaimants in this case would have been able to freely decide what to do with the properties—whether it was to sell the properties, refinance, or give the properties as gifts. The counterclaim defendants’ filing of the notices of lis pendens effectively took those opportunities off the table for a long period of time. We hold, therefore, that, in this case, in order to remedy the harm caused to the counterclaimants while their property was “held hostage” by the malicious acts of the counterclaim defendants, the trial justice appropriately ruled that the counterclaimants suffered an actual pecuniary loss which was to be calculated by comparing the highest value of the properties during the time period they were subject to the notices of lis pendens with the value of the properties on the date the notices of lis pendens were removed.', 'We also deem it worth noting that, if we were to agree with the counterclaim defendants’ proposed method of determining pecuniary loss in a slander of title action, we would create a situation whereby the owner of a property encumbered by a notice of lis pendens would be placed in the position of having to constantly attempt to sell a property even though he or she could not provide a clear marketable title. If the owner would be entitled to determine his or her pecuniary loss starting from the date the property had its highest market value while subject to the notice of lis pendens only if he or she had a prospective buyer at that time, an astute owner interested in receiving their full measure of damages in a slander of title action would have to continuously look for buyers. As Attorney Voccola testified at trial, it is a fruitless endeavor to attempt to sell a property with a cloud on its title.21 We decline the counterclaim defendants’ invitation to reach such an absurd result. Cf. Kingston Hill Academy v. Chariho Regional 21', 'In his testimony, Attorney Voccola stated that there was “no reason to go through the motions” of selling the properties since he was “unable to provide clean, marketable and insurable title” due to the notices of lis pendens.', '- 29 - School District, 21 A.3d 264, 273 (R.I. 2011) (noting that to decide the case another way “would effect an absurd result”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Accordingly, we hold that, the trial justice in this case did not err in the method he employed to determine whether there had been a pecuniary loss necessary for a slander of title action—namely, by comparing the fair market value of the properties at the time they reached their highest value during the period they were subject to the notices of lis pendens with the fair market value of the properties at the time the notices of lis pendens were removed, regardless of whether there was evidence of a “ready, willing, and able” buyer.', '2. Prejudgment Interest22', 'The trial justice, in awarding damages on the slander of title claim, ruled that the counterclaimants were entitled to prejudgment interest to be calculated from November 15, 2002—the date on which the notices of lis pendens were filed. In support of his award the trial justice relied on G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10.23 22', 'Although we recognize that prejudgment interest is technically not an element of damages, we shall discuss it in this section of the opinion (entitled “Slander of Title— Damages”) simply because it, like the other subsections under the just-referenced heading, relates to the total amount that in the end will be payable to the counterclaimants. See DiMeo v. Philbin, 502 A.2d 825, 826 (R.I. 1986). 23', 'The counterclaim defendants initially contend that the counterclaimants have conceded that the prejudgment interest awarded by the trial justice should have been awarded from September of 2005 (the date when the properties at issue reached their highest value during the time period when they were subject to the notices of lis pendens), rather than November 15, 2002 (the date on which the notices of lis pendens were filed). Our review of the counterclaimants’ pre-briefing statement, filed pursuant to Article I, Rule 12(A) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, does confirm that the counterclaimants appear to concede that the trial justice’s start date, with respect to the award of prejudgment interest, was erroneous: “The appellees acknowledge that the date from which prejudgment interest accrues should be September 30, 2005.”', 'We have held: (1) that arguments raised in a pre-briefing statement but not reiterated in the full brief are waived; and (2) that the failure to raise an issue in a pre-briefing statement does not waive that issue for full briefing.

However,', '- 30 -', 'It is the contention of the counterclaim defendants that the award was in error. They argue that the trial justice should have awarded prejudgment interest starting from the date the properties reached their highest value during the time in which they were subjected to the notices of lis pendens—viz., September of 2005. The counterclaim defendants point to the fact that the trial justice awarded compensatory damages focusing on the date the properties reached their highest value, and they argue that prejudgment interest should have been calculated accordingly. Not surprisingly, the counterclaimants contend that the trial justice was correct in his reliance on § 9-21-10 and in ruling that prejudgment interest began to accrue on the date when the notices of lis pendens were filed.', 'Section 9-21-10(a) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a', 'decision made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the', 'clerk of the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of', 'twelve percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of', 'action accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered', 'therein.” (Emphasis added.) As the counterclaimants point out, the statute expressly requires prejudgment interest to accrue “from the date the cause of action accrued.” As discussed in Part IV.B.1, supra, the properties at issue in this case were (in the particularly apt words of the trial justice) “held hostage” by the counterclaim defendants from the moment the notices of lis pendens were filed. Consequently, a contrary to the argument of the counterclaim defendants, it does not follow from our previous holdings that the counterclaimants in this case waived any right to argue in favor of the trial justice’s award of prejudgment interest in their full brief. Rather, it is a logical extrapolation from our just-referenced case law to state that, if the failure of an appellant to raise an issue in his or her pre-briefing statement does not waive his or her right to raise it at full briefing, then the concession of a point by an appellee in his or her pre-briefing statement does not preclude the appellee from raising the issue at the time of full briefing. Moreover, the counterclaim defendants in this case had ample opportunity to respond to any argument made by the counterclaimants with respect to prejudgment interest—namely, by addressing such argument in their reply brief. See Bowen Court Associates, 818 A.2d at 729. Thus, we do not deem the fact that there is language in the counterclaimants pre-briefing statement seemingly conceding that prejudgment interest should accrue from September of 2005 to be determinative.', '- 31 - cause of action for slander of title accrued at the moment the notices of lis pendens were filed; as such, we hold that § 9-21-10(a) controls and prejudgment interest accrued from November 15, 2002.24 See Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 924 (R.I. 2006) (holding, in the context of an arbitration regarding an individual’s claim for uninsured motorist benefits, that prejudgment interest accrued from the date of injury); see also Buckley v. Brown Plastics Machinery, LLC, 368 F. Supp. 2d 167, 172-73 (D.R.I. 2005) (holding that, in a case dealing with a demand for performance on a contract and applying § 9-21-10, the date of accrual of the cause of action was the date the action was filed). Consequently, we affirm the holding of the trial justice.', '3. Punitive Damages', 'As was previously noted, the trial justice awarded $630,000 in compensatory damages, along with $151,267 in legal fees, $24,080.40 in expenses, as well as prejudgment interest running from November 15, 2002 against all of the counterclaim defendants, whereas he awarded $845,000 in punitive damages against Frederick Sr. alone.', 'With respect to punitive damages the trial justice found that “this is the rare case where punitive damages are justified.” He set forth his reasons for that finding as follows:', '“[P]unitive damages are justified in light of the following factors:', 'Frederick, Sr.’s admission that he lied under oath when he claimed', 'ownership of the four properties and, as the [c]ourt found, that', 'most of his testimony was not worthy of belief.

He noted that Frederick Sr. testified that: (1) he had “acquired wealth over his lifetime;” (2) that he owned a business called “Coin-o-Matic;” (3) that all of Frederick Jr.’s money “came from him;” and (4) that Frederick Sr. and Frederick Jr. had “money on the street”25 and had other investments as well—including ownership of stocks such as Oxford Healthcare, 25', 'The Urban Dictionary defines “put money on the street” as follows: “It means to loan or give money to other people and businesses.” The Urban Dictionary, http://www.urbandictionary .com/define.php?term=put+money+on+the+street (last visited May 14, 2014).', '- 33 - which Frederick Sr. sold for a profit (which the trial justice stated had also been testified to by “the investment banker and the accountant”).

McDermott, 114 R.I. 107, 109,', '- 34 - the question of whether adequate facts exist to meet that standard and support an award of punitive damages is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo.

However, in the instant case, Frederick Sr. does not challenge the finding of the trial justice that this is a case in which an award of punitive damages is appropriate. Instead, Frederick Sr. contends only: (1) that the trial justice misconceived the evidence when assessing his ability to pay; and (2) that the award of punitive damages was excessive. We are mindful, however, that such determinations are confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and we will not alter a ruling absent convincing evidence of an abuse of that discretion. Jenison, 485 A.2d at 1244 (“Once the court has determined the case to be a proper one for punitive damages, whether the plaintiff is entitled to such an award is discretionary upon the finder of fact.”); see Sherman, 114 R.I. at 108-09, 329 A.2d at 196.', 'i. Frederick Sr.’s Ability to Pay', 'Frederick Sr.’s first contention with respect to the trial justice’s award of punitive damages is that the trial justice inaccurately assessed his ability to pay. Frederick Sr. alleges that, once a trial justice decides to consider the ability of a defendant to pay punitive damages, “his award cannot withstand appeal if it is based [on] a misconception of the evidence.” Accordingly, Frederick Sr. avers that the award of punitive damages in the instant case was based upon a misconception of the evidence, which he says resulted from the trial justice’s 329 A.2d 195, 196-97 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Peckham v. Hirschfeld, 570 A.2d 663, 668-69 (R.I. 1990).', '- 35 - reliance on financial information which was “outdated and incorrect.” Specifically, he alleges: (1) that, contrary to the trial justice’s finding, there was no evidence that he was “in the business of” privately lending money; (2) that the trial justice relied upon business activity and property ownership evidence that was “decades old;” (3) that the trial justice’s belief that Frederick Sr. was in possession of “70 acres of developable land in Coventry” was unfounded; (4) that the trial justice erred when he referenced Frederick Sr.’s ownership of property at the Point Judith Lighthouse since that property had been “optioned” in 1984; (5) that, contrary to the trial justice’s finding, any interest which Frederick Sr. possessed in the business called “Coin-o- Matic” or the property which housed its base of operations had been transferred to Frederick Jr.; and (6) that “the trial justice noted that Frederick Sr. made money on the stock market but failed to note that Frederick Jr. had taken $60,000 of Frederick Sr.’s stock money.” Frederick Sr. posits that “[a]ll in all, the evidence at trial demonstrated that Frederick Sr. is retired, gave away his interest in the Atwells Avenue property where his business was located, and transferred virtually all of his real estate to Frederick Jr. during the latter’s lifetime.”', 'The counterclaimants remind us that any findings by the trial justice with respect to credibility or the weight of the evidence are entitled to deference, and they point to the fact that the trial justice found Frederick Sr.’s testimony to be largely a “knowing fabrication.” They further point out that in this case “[t]he trial Justice was not carried away by passion or prejudice.” Moreover, the counterclaimants direct our attention to the fact that the trial justice was aware of the law with respect to punitive damages in Rhode Island since he cited to both Peckham, 570 A.2d at 663 and DeLeo, 546 A.2d at 1344. They further contend that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s determination that Frederick Sr. was able to pay the punitive damages awarded; they note that, even though Frederick Sr. had the opportunity to', '- 36 - submit evidence about his then-current financial situation, he chose not to avail himself of that opportunity.', 'Our precedent in this area of the law is clear; we have held that proof of ability to pay is not “a condition precedent” for the awarding of punitive damages. Sherman, 114 R.I. at 110, 329 A.2d at 197. We have specifically dealt with the issue on numerous occasions, but our opinions in Castellucci v. Battista, 847 A.2d 243 (R.I. 2004), and Greater Providence Deposit Corp. v. Jenison, 485 A.2d 1242 (R.I. 1984), are particularly on point. In Jenison, one of the defendants contended that it was error for the trial justice to award punitive damages without taking into account his ability to pay. Jenison, 485 A.2d at 1244. We rejected that contention and stated that “logic demand[s] that a defendant carr[ies] the burden of showing his modest means, facts particularly within his power, if he wants this matter considered in mitigation of damages.” Id. at 1245. We proceeded to hold that the defendant had been aware that punitive damages were being sought and still failed to introduce any evidence with respect to his inability to pay and that therefore, “he should [not] now be heard to complain about [his] absence or paucity.” Id.', 'The defendant in Castellucci, like the defendant in Jenison, contended “that a plaintiff should be required to present a threshold amount of evidence about a defendant’s financial status as a condition precedent to an award of punitive damages or that a plaintiff’s failure to offer such evidence precludes the need for the defendant to mitigate the damages with his own presentation of evidence.” Castellucci, 847 A.2d at 246. Again, as in Jenison, we rejected the defendant’s argument. Id. We stated that, although plaintiffs must show that the actions of defendants merit punitive damages, “our law does not require a further demonstration of the depth of the reservoir from which resources could be drawn to satisfy a punitive damage award.” Id. at 246-47, 247', '- 37 - (stating that our law on the issue of proof of a defendant’s ability to pay punitive damages was “clear” and that we “decline[d] defendant’s invitation to change it”). We proceeded to hold that it was the defendant’s obligation to present evidence of his financial condition if he hoped to reduce the punitive damages award; “a defendant need not sit idly by, fated to pay a punitive award based strictly on what the fact-finder discerns solely from plaintiff’s presentation of the case.” Id. at 247. It was our judgment that, “[b]y not coming forward with evidence of his financial means, defendant either took a risk or made a tactical decision that did not bear fruit.” Id. at 248.', 'We perceive no difference between the case before us and Jenison or Castellucci. The counterclaimants had no duty to present evidence of Frederick Sr.’s ability to pay; rather, Frederick Sr. had the duty to present evidence that would tend to demonstrate his inability to satisfy a punitive damages award. He made a choice not to present any convincing evidence of what he contends were his empty pockets.', 'Accordingly, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the following statement made by the counterclaimants in their brief:', '“Fred Sr. chose not to offer evidence of his current financial', 'condition. He made a tactical decision that evidence of his wealth', 'was helpful to his theory of the case: that he, Fred Sr., was the', 'source of everything Fred Jr. accumulated over the course of his', 'life and, in particular the source of the money for the 4 properties.', 'It is too late for Fred Sr. to complain that he did not offer evidence', 'of the shallowness of his pockets and he cannot shift the burden of', 'having to prove the depth of his financial reservoir to the', '[counterclaimants].”', 'We note that in the instant case the trial justice was the fact-finder, and there is no indication in the record that he was susceptible to “passion and prejudice.” Reccko v. Criss Cadillac Co., 610 A.2d 542, 546 (R.I. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Exemplary Damages in the Law of Torts, 70 Harv. L. Rev. at 530 (“[A] judge has wider', '- 38 - experience with wrongdoers [than a jury] and is familiar with the normal scope and size of awards. The flexibility which exemplary damages bring to the admonitory function of tort law can better be achieved by the judge than by the jury.”).', 'Additionally, determinations of credibility and the weight of the evidence are left to the fact-finder and we will not disturb the trial justice’s findings when there is no convincing evidence that he abused his discretion. See State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (“[A] trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Cahill, 11 A.3d at 86. After a thorough review of the evidence that Frederick Sr. alleges was misconceived by the trial justice, we can perceive nothing that would lead us to conclude that the trial justice misconceived the evidence or abused his discretion29 in: (1) finding that Frederick Sr. was able to pay punitive damages; and (2) proceeding to assess punitive damages against him.', 'ii. The Amount of Punitive Damages', 'Frederick Sr. also argues that the punitive damages award was excessive. He notes that this Court has, in the past, reduced such awards, and he contends that the punitive damages award in the instant case was disproportionate to the compensatory damages award because, he argues (as the counterclaim defendants argued with respect to the compensatory damages), the counterclaimants in the instant case suffered no damages. Accordingly, it is Frederick Sr.’s argument that the punitive damages awarded in this case “shock[] the conscience and should be struck down in [their] entirety * * * .” He further avers that, even if this Court upholds the 29', 'Frederick Sr. relies heavily on his own testimony in support of his argument that the trial justice misconceived the evidence when finding that he was able to pay punitive damages. We remind the reader, however, that the trial justice found Frederick Sr.’s testimony to largely lack credibility; in fact he held that much of it was a “knowing fabrication.” That determination is entitled to deference on our part. See Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 86 (R.I. 2011).', '- 39 - compensatory damages award (which we have done), the punitive damages are still excessive. The counterclaimants, in response, claim that there is not so great a discrepancy between the compensatory damages and the punitive damages in this case as to “shock the conscience.”', 'Mindful of the fact that “[p]unitive damages are imprecise and elusive of review,” we have held that a jury award of punitive damages (or in this case the award by a trial justice) may be “set aside * * * if the amount clearly appears to be excessive,” “shocks the conscience” or appears to represent “passion and prejudice” rather than an “unbiased judgment.” Zarrella v. Robinson, 460 A.2d 415, 418 (R.I. 1983); Cady v. IMC Mortgage Co., 862 A.2d 202, 220 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); Minutelli v. Boranian, 668 A.2d 317, 319 (R.I. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). We bear constantly in mind the importance of the fact that the trial justice is in a better position than this Court to assess the testimony of the witnesses and determine credibility, and we “do not lightly disagree with the findings of the trial justice on the matter of * * * punitive damages.” Minutelli, 668 A.2d at 319. Nevertheless, we consider the $845,000 punitive damages award to be excessive. It is our judgment that, if we reduce the punitive damages award by half, it is still “adequate to punish” Frederick Sr. and deter future misuse of notices of lis pendens. Id.; see DeLeo, 546 A.2d at 1348 (affirming the decision of a trial justice to reduce a jury’s punitive damages award from $75,000 to $30,000 because the award was “grossly excessive” and “such an amount was not needed to deter [the individuals involved in the case] or others from conducting themselves similarly in the future”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Reccko, 610 A.2d at 546 (reducing a punitive damages award of $50,000 to $25,000). Accordingly, we hold that Frederick Sr. is liable for $422,500 in punitive damages.', '- 40 -', 'C', 'Slander of Title—Frederick Sr.’s Living Children', 'The final argument with which we must deal is the assertion by the counterclaim defendants that, due to the fact that Frederick Sr.’s living children were not parties to the instant case at the time the notices of lis pendens were filed, it was error for the trial justice to find them liable for slander of title.30 In our judgment the question of whether Frederick Sr.’s living children were properly held to be liable for slander of title is a question of law, which we shall review in a de novo manner. See Gianquitti, 22 A.3d at 1165.', 'The counterclaim defendants find fault specifically with the trial justice’s reliance on Rule 15(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; it is their contention that the “relation-back doctrine” under Rule 15 applies only to complaints, not to notices of lis pendens. Moreover, the counterclaim defendants aver that the trial justice inappropriately imputed Frederick Sr.’s malice to his children; they contend that such an imputation is appropriate only where there is an agency relationship, and they note that no such relationship exists in the instant case. Accordingly, the counterclaim defendants contend that the trial justice’s decision holding the living children liable for slander of title was erroneous as a matter of law.', 'Conversely, the counterclaimants urge us to affirm the trial justice’s holding that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie are liable for slander of title. They contend that the siblings “affirmatively embraced” the notices of lis pendens. As the counterclaimants point out, Phillip joined the suit “voluntarily” and Freida and Laurie had many courses of action available to them, which they chose not to pursue: for example, according to the counterclaimants, Freida and Laurie “could 30', 'All of Frederick Sr.’s living children became parties to this case after the notices of lis pendens were filed. The trial justice determined that Phillip “voluntarily” joined the case, whereas Freida and Laurie were joined as necessary parties.', '- 41 - have declined to join the suit,” “renounced any interest in * * * the properties,” assigned their interest to Frederick Sr., or contended that they were misled by Frederick Sr.’s assertions and thus had a good faith belief that they had an interest in the properties. In further support of their argument, the counterclaimants point to the fact that, at a later point in the proceedings below, Phillip, Freida, and Laurie objected to the quashing of the notices of lis pendens.', 'The counterclaimants assert that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie knew what they stood to gain should they prevail and what Angela Giguere and Christine Giguere-Carrozza stood to lose; the counterclaimants note that, even knowing what Angela Giguere and Christine Giguere-Carrozza stood to lose, the siblings made no attempt to differentiate their interest in the properties from the interest their father was asserting when he filed the notices of lis pendens.', 'The trial justice commenced his discussion with respect to the liability of Frederick Sr.’s living children by addressing Phillip’s liability; he stated that Phillip had voluntarily joined the action and that, as an attorney himself, he “would certainly have understood the significance of joining” the case as a plaintiff. The trial justice proceeded in his reasoning to note that all three of the siblings were charged with knowledge of the public records—including the fact that Frederick Jr. had held title to the four properties at issue at the time of his death “as well as the original lis pendens filed by [Frederick Sr.] * * * .” With regard to his reasoning for holding the living children liable for slander of title the trial justice stated, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“They could have filed their own amended lis pendens, limiting', 'their claims to the condominium unit and Post Road properties but', 'chose not to.

Rule 15(c) is entitled “Relation Back of Amendments” and provides in pertinent part as follows: 31', 'We reiterate that the parties in this case entered into a stipulation with respect to the joining of Phillip, Freida, and Laurie, which was read into the record at the slander of title trial.

Applying that language, this Court had held that Rule 15(c) allowed relation back to the original complaint only when defendants were added in an amended complaint, but not when additional plaintiffs were added. See, e.g., Balletta v. McHale, 823 A.2d 292, 294-95 (R.I. 2003). Rule 15(c) was amended to remove that restriction. The Committee Notes to the 2006 amendment to Rule 15(c) state as follows:', '“The second sentence of Rule 15(c), relative to changing a', 'party ‘against whom a claim is asserted’ provides that, subject to', 'certain requirements, such amendment relates back. The provision', 'was based on what became a 1966 amendment to Federal Rule', '15(c).', '“In Balletta v. McHale, 823 A.2d 292 (R.I. 2003), the', 'Supreme Court of Rhode Island applied the sentence literally to', 'include only added defendants. The court rejected relation back of', ""an amendment adding a spouse's claim of loss of consortium to a"", 'personal injury action. Addition of a party asserting a claim is not', 'within the language of this second sentence. The advisory', 'committee note to the Federal Rule change, however, indicates that', 'this had not been a problem, that such amendments had been', 'allowed to relate back under the first sentence of Rule 15(c). The', ""reporter's note to Super. R. Civ. P. 15(c) makes the same point."", 'The present proposal is designed to restore that understanding.” The Committee Notes make it clear that Rule 15(c) was intended to allow relation back of a plaintiff added in an amended complaint. That amendment to the Rule provides further reinforcement of the trial justice’s holding in the instant case that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie’s', '- 44 -', 'The plain language of the rule makes it clear that it is perfectly appropriate for a trial justice to find that plaintiffs who were joined in an amended complaint relate back to the original complaint if the claim asserted in the amended pleading “arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.” Cf. State v. Graff, 17 A.3d 1005, 1010 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]e have indicated that a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Fleet National Bank v. Clark, 714 A.2d 1172, 1177 (R.I. 1998) (“If the language is clear on its face, then the plain meaning of the statute must be given effect and this Court should not look elsewhere to discern the legislative intent.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The counterclaim defendants contend that, even given the language of the rule, it is not intended to apply to a notice of lis pendens and that, accordingly, it was inappropriate for the trial justice to attribute Frederick Sr.’s malice at the time of filing the original complaint and the notices of lis pendens to his children. However, the counterclaim defendants have cited to nothing which definitively excludes lis pendens from the application of Rule 15(c). Moreover, even if we were to accept the counterclaim defendants’ contention that the trial justice was in error when he relied on Rule 15(c), it is nonetheless our judgment that the trial justice’s ultimate conclusion that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie are liable for slander of title was correct because, as the trial justice suggested, Phillip, Freida, and Laurie adopted the notices of lis pendens through their own actions (or lack of action) subsequent to being joined as plaintiffs in the case.33 joinder in the “First Amended Miscellaneous Petition” related back to the filing of the “Miscellaneous Petition to Impose Trust.” 33', 'The counterclaim defendants contend that the trial justice imputed Frederick Sr.’s malice on to his children, which would only be appropriate when there is an agency relationship. However, after a review of the trial justice’s reasoning, we do not perceive any indication that he imputed Frederick Sr.’s malice to his living children. Rather, he found that the living children had adopted the notices of lis pendens based on their actions after joining the case. Those', '- 45 -', 'After an extensive and intensive review of the record, we are in agreement with the counterclaimants that “the record is clear, [that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie] affirmatively embraced the Lis Pendens and the consequences that followed therefrom.” Although the trial justice found that Freida and Laurie were not joined voluntarily, all the siblings could have renounced an interest in the properties at issue. Instead, they chose to remain as plaintiffs in the civil action and, by staying in the suit, they claimed that they had an interest in the properties at issue, despite (1) their knowledge that the title to all of the properties was in Frederick Jr.’s name, and (2) the clear lack of any evidence, as found by the trial justice, sufficient to show that Frederick Sr. had contributed to the purchase price of the properties.', 'From the outset and even to this day, the surviving siblings have never renounced or denounced the notices of lis pendens filed by Frederick Sr.34 In fact, in “Plaintiffs’ Objection to actions, coupled with the siblings’ knowledge of the facts which formed the basis of their claim, were sufficient to support a finding that they also acted with malice. Therefore, the counterclaim defendants’ agency argument does not change our conclusion that the trial justice was correct in holding Phillip, Freida, and Laurie liable for slander of title. 34', 'In the “Defendants’ Answer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Miscellaneous Petition and Counterclaim” filed by the counterclaimants (defendants in the proceedings below) they alleged that:', '“Plaintiffs Philip Carrozza, Freida Carrozza and Laurie Carrozza-', 'Con [sic] have by First Amended Miscellaneous Petition, joined', 'plaintiff Frederick Carrozza Sr., have adopted the aforesaid', 'Notices of Lis Pendens as their own and with said Frederick', 'Carrozza Sr., claim both legal and equitable ownership interest in', 'the aforesaid parcels of real property.” In the “Reply to Amended Counterclaim” the counterclaim defendants (plaintiffs below) responded as follows:', '“At this stage, petitioner does not have sufficient information or', 'belief to form a response to the allegation and neither admits nor', 'denies and petitioner leaves defendants to their proofs. Further,', 'Philip Carrozza voluntarily has moved to join in the matter', '- 46 - Defendants’ Motion to Quash and Remove Lis Pendens” (Objection) the counterclaim defendants, including Phillip, Freida, and Laurie, stated, in the course of objecting to the motion to quash, that they “ha[d] an absolute right to maintain the recorded lis pendens and claim ownership or an equitable interest in the properties until and unless a final judgment enters.” We view those words as constituting an admission by the living children that they were adopting the notices of lis pendens. Moreover, the Objection makes it clear that the siblings were willing participants in the lawsuit and expected to benefit if the counterclaim defendants won. On the basis of that fact, coupled with the knowledge which we infer the siblings had that title to all of the properties at issue was in the name of their brother, not their father, and that the notices of lis pendens effectively made the properties unmarketable, it is our conclusion that they “affirmatively embraced” the notices of lis pendens and thereby had the malice necessary to support a finding that they slandered the title of those properties.', 'whereas Laurie Carrozza-Conn and Freida Carrozza were', 'compelled and ordered to be joined in the matter by defendant’s', 'motion to compel. It is unclear what interest or position they will', 'assert at this point.” While, the counterclaimants are correct that the response of the counterclaim defendants was not an unequivocal denial, we recognize that under Rule 8(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, a response stating that “the party is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment” has the effect of a denial. This Court also recognizes that, in that same filing, the counterclaim defendants expressly denied that: (1) “[t]he aforesaid Notices of Lis Pendens constitute malicious utterances of false statements concerning the defendants’ title to the subject properties;” and (2) “[t]he false statements uttered by plaintiff Frederick Carrozza Sr. and adopted by plaintiffs Philip Carrozza, Laurie Carrozza-Conn and Freida Carrozza were made with knowledge of the falsity thereof, with the intent to injure the defendants and to cause the subject properties to be unmarketable.” However, these denials reflect only the belief of the siblings that the filing of the notices of lis pendens by their father was not malicious; they did not expressly deny having adopted or, as the counterclaimants put it, “affirmatively embraced” the notices of lis pendens.', '- 47 -', 'We further conclude that the trial justice’s metaphorical observation that the siblings were standing “with their hands outstretched, waiting for a decision * * * that would place [Frederick Jr.’s] property in those outstretched hands” was certainly not erroneous. There were options available to Phillip, Freida, and Laurie whereby they could have sought to distance themselves from the notices of lis pendens. As the counterclaimants point out, the siblings could have renounced any interest in the properties at issue; they could have continued to litigate while having allowed the notices of lis pendens to be quashed without objection. Additionally, they could have argued that they were misled by the false assertions of Frederick Sr. and, as a result, could not be found to have had the required malice for a slander of title claim because they had an honest belief that they possessed an interest in the properties. See Peckham, 570 A.2d at 667. They did none of those things. For that reason and the other reasons we have discussed supra, we uphold the ruling of the trial justice that Phillip, Freida, and Laurie are liable, along with their father, for slandering the title to the four properties at issue in this case.', 'In conclusion, it is our judgment that: (1) the trial justice did not commit clear error or misconceive or overlook material evidence when he held Frederick Sr. liable for slander of title; (2) the trial justice properly computed compensatory damages by subtracting the value of the property on the date the notices of lis pendens were removed from the highest value of the properties attained during the time period in which they were subject to the notices of lis pendens (which occurred in 2005); (3) prejudgment interest should be calculated starting from November 15, 2002, the date of the filing of the notices of lis pendens; (4) the trial justice did not misconceive any material evidence in awarding punitive damages against Frederick Sr., but those punitive damages shall be reduced to $422,500; and (5) the trial justice properly found Phillip, Freida, and Laurie liable for slander of title.', '- 48 -', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in all respects except that part of the judgment awarding $845,000 in punitive damages, which we vacate. We hold that the award of punitive damages should be reduced to $422,500, and we remand the record in this case to the Superior Court with instructions that it enter judgment in accordance with this opinion.', 'Justice Flaherty did not participate.', '- 49 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Frederick Carrozza, Sr., et al. v.

(Lyric). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 4, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Lyric came to the attention of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF or the department) on December 21, 2010, when he was born at the Women and Infants Hospital. His mother, Caitlin Patenaude, was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) at the time but was brought to the hospital to give birth. DCYF was informed that the mother had tested positive for opiates and cocaine at several points during the pregnancy and had also tested', '-1- positive for methadone at the time of delivery. Lyric also tested positive for methadone at birth. DCYF noted that when Lyric was born it was in the process of terminating the mother’s parental rights in regard to another of her children. 1', 'The mother identified Lyric’s biological father as respondent, Robert Molenda, who was also incarcerated at the ACI at that time. 2 Molenda disputed the paternity of Lyric and the Family Court, on January 28, 2011, ordered that a paternity test be conducted. The results of the paternity test established that Molenda was indeed the father of Lyric.', 'DCYF filed a neglect petition for Lyric on December 23, 2010. Lyric was placed in the temporary custody of DCYF on January 20, 2011, pursuant to a December 30, 2010 Family Court order.', 'DCYF filed a petition on June 4, 2012 to terminate the parental rights of both Lyric’s biological mother and respondent. In its petition, DCYF alleged the following grounds for terminating the parental rights of both parents: that they were unfit by reason of conduct seriously detrimental to the child in that they have chronic substance-abuse problems; and that the child had been placed in the legal custody of DCYF for at least twelve months with no substantial probability that the child would be able to return safely to the parents’ custody within a reasonable period of time. The Family Court subsequently granted a motion by DCYF to amend the petition, which added the following ground for terminating the parental rights of respondent: that he was unfit by reason of conduct seriously detrimental to the child such as 1', 'The mother’s termination of parental rights with respect to that child was appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the decree of the Family Court terminating the mother’s parental rights.

On March 13, 2012, respondent was sentenced on one count of domestic assault to five years, with one year to serve, concurrent and retroactive to his other sentences. At the time of the hearing, he was scheduled to be released from the ACI on April 13, 2013.', '-2- mental illness, mental deficiency, or institutionalization of the parent for such a duration as to render it improbable for the parent to care for the child for an extended period of time.', 'A hearing on the termination of parental rights of both the mother and respondent was held before a justice of the Family Court on September 14 and 18, 2012, and October 19, 2012. 3 Jennifer Jawharjian, a DCYF caseworker, testified that she had been assigned to Lyric’s case from his birth. Ms. Jawharjian explained that Lyric was born premature, had been addicted to substances at birth, and had difficulty breathing. She stated that he was on medication to help with withdrawal symptoms from addiction and that he has also received physical therapy. After being discharged from the hospital, Lyric first went to a specialized home for children with medical needs before going to a foster home.', 'Ms. Jawharjian further testified that the case plan she had developed for Molenda regarding Lyric required that he complete classes in domestic violence, anger management, parenting, and substance abuse. She explained that she identified those specific classes because Molenda was in the ACI on a charge of felony assault against the mother and because she was concerned that he might also have a history of substance abuse. Ms. Jawharjian said that, to her knowledge, respondent had not attended any of the required classes while at the ACI.', 'Ms. Jawharjian testified that she had given her contact information to respondent shortly after Lyric’s birth but that, from the day Lyric was born through May of 2012, when her assignment to Lyric’s case ended, she had never been contacted by respondent with any inquiries as to Lyric’s welfare. She stated that Lyric’s visits with respondent at the ACI began soon after paternity was established. She further elaborated that these visits with respondent were generally 3', 'Lyric’s mother’s parental rights were terminated after she was defaulted for failing to appear at the trial. The mother filed an appeal to this Court but later withdrew the appeal. Accordingly, the termination of the mother’s parental rights is not at issue before this Court.', '-3- biweekly unless some issue arose with regard to Lyric’s health. She clarified that she supervised between six and ten visits and that a case aide supervised the other visits. She recalled that during the visits respondent generally showed affection for the baby.', 'Ms. Jawharjian also testified that, from her observations of Lyric in his foster home, “he is very well taken care of, nurtured by both [foster] parents, bonded to both parents as well as the other children in the home.” She stated that respondent had objected to Lyric’s placement in this foster home, desiring that Lyric be placed with his own mother, Lyric’s paternal grandmother, instead. Ms. Jawharjian explained that respondent’s mother had indicated that she could not take care of Lyric at that time.', 'Linda Brown, who took over Lyric’s case from Ms. Jawharjian, testified next. She noted that visits to the ACI were “difficult for the child because it’s * * * not a child-friendly environment[,]” but stated that respondent showed affection for the child during the two visits that she supervised. Ms. Brown explained that Lyric continued to receive special services, including physical and occupational therapy, because he had not reached the age-appropriate milestones in his development. She agreed with Ms. Jawharjian that Lyric appeared to be very comfortable in his foster home and that “[h]e seems attached to the foster mother.”', 'The next person to testify was respondent’s mother, Romualda Molenda. Ms. Molenda testified that she had met Lyric only once, in July 2011, but that she had asked to see Lyric on other occasions as well. On being asked if she had been contacted about possibly taking Lyric into her home, she responded that at the time she was afraid of Lyric’s mother because Lyric’s mother used to “beat [respondent] up.” Ms. Molenda stated that, prior to his arrest, respondent had owned a house in Providence, but that it has since been “foreclosed” and that she bought the house at the foreclosure sale. She explained that she bought the house so “[t]hat [respondent]', '-4- and his son and his daughter 4 can have a home to live in.” Ms. Molenda further testified that respondent had been self-supporting and employed in construction, painting, and truck driving.', 'The respondent testified next, disputing Ms. Jawharjian’s testimony regarding substance abuse and attendance at classes. He submitted a letter he had written to his attorney in June of 2012, in which he wrote that he was following the case plan set up by DCYF and that he had begun mental-health counseling, drug and alcohol abuse classes, and parenting classes. The respondent also submitted certificates of completion for substance-abuse classes, a parenting class, and a health-education class, copies of which he asserted he had also sent to DCYF.', 'The respondent confirmed that, from 1990 up until his incarceration in 2010, he worked in construction and drove trucks during the winter months. Molenda asserted that he had offered to provide financial support for Lyric to Ms. Jawharjian but that she had refused it. He also stated that he had volunteered his daughter to help with Lyric’s care as “the foster mother was [overwhelmed] * * * with three kids.” He explained that he had deeded his house over to his mother in September 2011, before he was sentenced, “because [he] wasn’t sure how much time [he was] going to get * * *.” 5 He testified that he had been in contact with Lyric’s foster parents through their relatives to inquire about Lyric’s welfare. According to him, he had not contacted DCYF directly because “[it] was a very scattered organization” but that “[he] always knew what was happening with [his] son * * *.” He said that he had asked his lawyer to ask Ms. Jawharjian for visitation whenever he was in court but that he had not contacted DCYF outside of those occasions because he believed he was not permitted to do so. The respondent also claimed that 4', 'The respondent’s daughter, who was nineteen years old and lived with Ms. Molenda at the time of the hearing, had been mostly raised by respondent up until his arrest. 5', 'The respondent appeared to be somewhat confused as to whether he had actually deeded his house to his mother or if she had bought the house after the mortgage had been foreclosed. In any event, it is undisputed that respondent’s house in Providence is currently owned by his mother.', '-5- he was not able to call DCYF from the ACI because making calls to an automated number was not permitted. 6 He estimated that in the twenty-two months of Lyric’s life, he had approximately twelve visits with him lasting about an hour each, saying that he used to play with him and change his diaper and bottle-feed him. He also stated that DCYF had promised visits to make up for any that were missed and that the visits were supposed to be biweekly but that sometimes two months went by between them.', 'He asserted that, with good-time credits, he expected his release from the ACI to occur on January 1, 2013, and that afterwards he would live with his mother until he could ensure that his house in Providence was habitable again. He testified that his mother’s house would be an appropriate home for Lyric as well, noting that Lyric had visited Ms. Molenda there once before. He also stated that he expected to be employed by a painting company upon his release from the ACI, and offered a letter from the company confirming that respondent would have an opportunity for employment upon release.', 'Molenda stated that he was aware that Lyric needed physical therapy and that his speech development was delayed. He confirmed that he was willing to learn how to provide the necessary care for Lyric and did not feel that there was any impediment to his ability to take care of Lyric. He also explained that he had spoken with both his mother and his daughter about helping him take care of Lyric while he was working. 7', 'The last witness at the hearing was Lyric’s foster mother, Mrs. Amanda Patenaude, who is also Lyric’s aunt. She testified as to Lyric’s special needs and his physical therapy, explaining 6', 'The respondent also submitted two letters which he had written to his attorney in which he requested visitation with Lyric. He stated that he was not aware that he was supposed to contact DCYF directly with regard to visitation as opposed to going through his lawyer or his mother. 7', 'The respondent testified that his daughter attends classes at CCRI and works at night as a manager at McDonald’s.', '-6- that she also has a two-year-old child who is enrolled in many of the same programs as Lyric, allowing the two children to attend them together. She stated that Lyric had become an integral part of her family, having grown up his entire life with her two children. She confirmed that “[she has] nothing but a mother’s love for him in every sense of the word.” She testified that she would adopt Lyric “[i]n a heartbeat * * * [with] no hesitation,” further adding that “[she] would be very, very, very devastated to ever see him go.” She acknowledged having a telephone conversation with Ms. Jawharjian’s supervisor, where she and her husband were asked if they would be willing to negotiate an open adoption and said that they would prefer not to. She admitted that she has never met respondent’s mother, Ms. Molenda, but explained that she would generally not be comfortable involving people she does not know in Lyric’s life.', 'In a bench decision at the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing justice found that DCYF had proven “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the child would not be able to return safely to his father’s home within a reasonable period of time. 8 He further stated that “it’s quite assuredly * * * in the child’s best interest that the father’s rights be terminated * * *.” In his decision, he noted that Lyric had never lived with respondent and that respondent had initially questioned Lyric’s paternity. He further took note of the fact that respondent had a history of violent behavior and domestic abuse. The hearing justice acknowledged the letter from the painting company but stated that “everybody knows * * * during these economic times[,] you just don’t walk out and get a job. You have to look for the job.” He also commented that the “[f]ather seems to me to be an expert on passing the burden on to someone else to take care of his responsibilities[,]” citing respondent’s testimony about his trouble contacting DCYF except “when he wanted to.” The 8', 'The hearing justice’s conclusion was prescient in that the child, at the time of oral argument, was still not able to return safely to his father’s home, as respondent had been voluntarily deported to Poland.', '-7- hearing justice conceded “that the father may very well love this child,” but stated that there is “no indication, no proof that this father ever loved the child.” In any event, the hearing justice emphasized that “love isn’t the sole answer to everything. Love doesn’t pay for the special services that this child needs. Love doesn’t put food into the child’s mouth or pay for the child’s clothing.” He further cast doubt upon respondent’s ability to provide the care that Lyric needs, explaining that respondent had “offered no practical explanation as to how he intended to do [so].” Finally, the hearing justice emphasized that Lyric had been in his foster home since he was a month old and had become an integral part of the family, citing Mrs. Amanda Patenaude’s testimony. Accordingly, the hearing justice terminated respondent’s parental rights.', 'A decree to that effect entered on November 16, 2012. The respondent filed a motion to enlarge the time to file a notice of appeal, which the Family Court granted on December 18, 2012. Thereafter, respondent filed a notice of appeal to this Court on December 19, 2012.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing appeals from [termination of parental rights] rulings, this Court examines the record ‘to establish whether the hearing justice’s findings are supported by legally competent evidence.’” In re David L., 877 A.2d 667, 671 (R.I. 2005) (quoting In re Shawn B., 864 A.2d 621, 623 (R.I. 2005)). The hearing justice’s findings are “entitled to great weight, and this Court will not disturb them unless they ‘are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d 446, 451 (R.I. 2012) (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008)).', '“Natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the ‘care, custody, and management’ of their children.” In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1279 (R.I. 2011) (quoting', '-8- Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982)).

First, respondent contends that DCYF had not shown that he was unfit by reason of imprisonment as he “anticipated [that he would] leave prison in a few months [of the hearing].” See G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i). Second, respondent argues that DCYF failed to satisfy its burden of proof that there was “not a substantial probability that the child [would] be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of time consider[ing] the child’s age and the need for a permanent home[.]” See § 15-7-7(a)(3). Third, respondent alleges that DCYF “failed to make reasonable efforts to rectify the situation that had caused Lyric to come into care by its failure to provide services.” See § 15-7-7(b)(1).', '-9-', 'The respondent concedes that Lyric had remained in the care of DCYF for at least twelve months, and does not contest the trial justice’s findings regarding the “best interests of the child” on appeal. 9', 'A', 'Lack of Substantial Probability of Child’s Return', 'Termination of parental rights under § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i) requires a finding that a', '“parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously', 'detrimental to the child; such as, but not limited to, * * *', '(i) [i]nstitutionalization of the parent, including imprisonment, for', 'a duration as to render it improbable for the parent to care for the', 'child for an extended period of time[.]” Termination of rights under § 15-7-7(a)(3) is allowed if the court finds that the child has been in the custody of DCYF for at least twelve months; that the parent has been offered services by DCYF to correct the situation; and that “there is not a substantial probability that the child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of time * * * [.]” A termination of rights may be supported on either ground, that respondent was unfit or that the child was unlikely to be able to return to respondent’s care within a reasonable period.', 'Here, after hearing testimony from respondent and Lyric’s paternal grandmother, the trial justice examined Molenda’s childcare support system.', 'The trial justice considered that respondent’s plan to care for Lyric upon release was to live at his mother’s house. 10 He found 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(c) requires that, even if the rest of the statute is satisfied, the best interests of the child must be considered before termination of parental rights. The trial justice found that termination of the father’s parental rights would be in Lyric’s best interest. The court stated that “this child is placed in relative care [sic] and this is a loving, nurturing and stable placement. This is also a pre-adoptive home where the child has been residing the child’s entire life—the only home the child has ever known.” We agree with the trial justice’s determination that termination of respondent’s rights is in the child’s best interest. 10', 'In evaluating this plan, the hearing justice may have considered the testimony of Lyric’s paternal grandmother, in addition to respondent’s testimony and other evidence. Lyric’s paternal', '- 10 - that respondent’s mother “basically took over the care and control of his daughter [at the time of respondent’s imprisonment] when she was 16 1/2 years of age” and that she had lived with Molenda’s mother since then.', 'The trial justice weighed respondent’s plan, finding it questionable: “Who takes care of Lyric during this period of time? His mother, as she took care of the daughter since she was at least 16 1/2? Father seems to me to be an expert on passing the burden on to someone else to take care of his responsibilities.”', 'Even when an incarcerated parent’s efforts to change the direction of his or her life are commendable, it may remain highly unlikely or impossible for a child to return safely to that parent’s care within a reasonable period of time. See In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d at 450-51. Moreover, “in considering the length of a parent’s incarceration, ‘the trial justice is not required to consider parole eligibility[;] he or she is only required to consider the probable duration of imprisonment at the time of the termination.’” Id. at 453 (quoting In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d 498, 503 (R.I. 2006)); see also In re Amber P., 877 A.2d 608, 615-16 (R.I. 2005) (holding that, while “the fact of incarceration alone is not sufficient to terminate parental rights,” the trial justice may consider the total sentence in determining the probable duration of imprisonment, as opposed to the date of earliest parole eligibility) (quoting In re Faith H., 813 A.2d 55, 57 (R.I. 2003)).', 'Molenda’s completion of classes at the ACI, consistent with the case plan, are praiseworthy and must be considered. However, these actions alone may not necessarily result in the child being able to return to respondent’s care within a reasonable period of time. The trial justice considered respondent’s testimony, “history of * * * domestic abuse[,]” and probable duration of imprisonment. The trial justice found that, even if respondent received parole at his earliest eligibility in January 2013, he would not be ready to take the child, as respondent “has grandmother explained why she had only met Lyric once and had declined to take Lyric into her home upon DCYF’s inquiry.', '- 11 - offered no practical explanation” as to how he would take care of the child. Accordingly, the trial justice concluded that the father was unfit by reason of imprisonment and that, even after the father’s release, he would not be able to take care of Lyric. See § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i).', 'Furthermore, having concluded that it was unlikely that Lyric would be able to return to respondent’s care and because it was undisputed that Lyric had been in the custody of DCYF for more than one year at the time of the hearing, the trial justice determined that the requirements of § 15-7-7(a)(3) had also been met. The trial justice “hears the testimony ‘[f]rom the vantage point of his front-row seat in the courtroom.’” In re Daniel D., 9 A.3d 651, 656 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d at 170). In the context of observing the testimony of respondent and other witnesses, the trial justice acted within his discretion in finding that respondent was unfit and that it was improbable that Lyric would be able to return to respondent’s care within a reasonable period of time. We are satisfied that the evidence in the record supports the trial justice’s findings. The trial justice did not clearly err in his conclusions; and, therefore, this Court defers to his judgment and will not disturb his decision on appeal.', 'B', 'Reasonable Efforts', 'In addition to proving that a ground for termination of parental rights exists because of parental unfitness or the lack of substantial probability that the child will be able to return to the parent’s care, DCYF must demonstrate that it has satisfied the “reasonable efforts” requirement of § 15-7-7(b)(1). 11 To meet this standard, the department must show that it has satisfied certain 11', 'Section 15-7-7(b)(1) provides in relevant part that', '“pursuant to [a termination for parental unfitness under] * * *', '(a)(2)(i) * * * the court shall find as a fact that * * * parental', 'conduct or conditions [that are seriously detrimental to the child]', '- 12 - requirements, including “case planning with the parent, arrangements for visitation, and keeping the parent informed of the child’s well-being.” In re Alan W., 665 A.2d 877, 878 (R.I. 1995). “‘Reasonable efforts’ are determined on a case-by-case basis * * *.” See In re Julian D., 18 A.3d 477, 484 (R.I. 2011). This Court has repeatedly stated that “it is primarily and ultimately the responsibility of the parent, not DCYF, ‘to substantially and repeatedly maintain contact with [his or her child]’ who is in the care of DCYF.” In re Daniel D., 9 A.3d at 656 (quoting In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 884 (R.I. 2006)). Furthermore, the department has no duty under § 15-7-7 “to create a case plan for the father until it establishe[s] his paternity.” In re Shaylon J., 782 A.2d 1140, 1143 (R.I. 2001).', 'DCYF had no obligation to respondent during the time period in which he denied paternity. See In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 883 (R.I. 2009); In re Shaylon J., 782 A.2d at 1143. Paternity was established in May 2011. In June 2011, when Lyric was approximately seven months old, biweekly visitation began and a case plan was formulated.', 'Although respondent contended at oral argument that DCYF missed multiple visits, the department explained that the child’s medical conditions prevented some of them.

The respondent admitted that he had never called DCYF’s assigned caseworker, Ms. Jawharjian, to inquire about the welfare of his child. He testified that he believed he should not speak to DCYF, since “[y]ou don’t talk to the prosecutors.” Moreover, he testified that he did not believe he could call DCYF through the phone at the ACI, despite Ms. Jawharjian’s testimony that she gave respondent her business card and that DCYF accepted collect calls from the ACI. Instead, respondent contended that he had regular but indirect contact with the foster parents through a fellow inmate—the brother of both the foster father and Lyric’s mother—and also through Lyric’s paternal grandmother. The trial justice was well within his authority to weigh evidence regarding respondent’s circuitous means of contact, and further, determine the reasonableness of DCYF’s efforts in light of respondent’s conduct and cooperation with the department. See In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d at 883.', 'We conclude that the trial justice had sufficient evidence to determine that DCYF’s actions constituted reasonable efforts.

49,"Michael Moura et al. : v. : Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, : Inc., et al.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiffs, Michael Moura and Margaret Moura, appeal from summary judgment entered against them and in favor of the defendants, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), Accredited Home Lenders, Inc., Foreclosure Management Co., Vericrest Financial, Inc., Accredited REO Properties, LLC, and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee on behalf of the LSF MRA Pass-Through Trust. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on April 8, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 8, 2007, the Mouras purchased a home at 114 Betsy Williams Drive in Warwick. To finance the transaction, Michael Moura executed a note, payable to Accredited Home Lenders, in the amount of $206,250. On the same day the Mouras signed the note, Accredited Home Lenders endorsed in blank an “allonge” 1 on the property. 2 The note was secured by a mortgage on the property that named plaintiffs as the mortgagors and MERS as the mortgagee, acting as a “nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns.” 3 Both the note and the mortgage designated Accredited Home Lenders as the Lender. Significantly, the mortgage further provided that “[b]orrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS, (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS, * * * with the Statutory Power of Sale.” The mortgage was recorded in the land evidence records of the City of Warwick on June 13, 2007. 1', 'An “allonge” is “[a] slip of paper sometimes attached to a negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when the original paper is filled with indorsements.” NV One, LLC v. Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, 84 A.3d 800, 803 n.4 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 88 (9th ed. 2009)). 2', 'This action by Accredited Home Lenders “does not identify a person to whom it makes the instrument payable.” See Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 530 n.3 (R.I. 2013) (quoting G.L. 1956 § 6A-3-205 cmt. 2). “When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.” Id. (quoting § 6A-3-205(b)). 3', 'On the mortgage, the notary states “[o]n this 8th day of June 2006”; however, we are confident that this is simply an error by the notary. Under “Definitions” on the first page of the mortgage, the following is written: “‘Security Instrument’ means this document, which is dated June 8, 2007 together with all Riders to this document.” The trial justice made a similar conclusion and also aptly noted that under G.L. 1956 § 34-11-1, a conveyance of lands by way of mortgage that is delivered is nonetheless valid and binding even if not acknowledged or recorded. The plaintiffs have not challenged that the mortgage was not delivered.', '-2-', 'On November 30, 2009, MERS assigned the mortgage to Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche Bank) “as Trustee on behalf of the LSF MRA Pass-Through Trust” (the Trust). The assignment was signed by “Hal Bartow, AVP” and notarized in Oklahoma. 4 This assignment was also recorded in the land evidence records in Warwick. In an affidavit filed in support of defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Eduardo Asher, Assistant Vice President of Vericrest Financial, attested that Vericrest became the attorney-in-fact for Deutsche Bank on or about June 26, 2009. 5', 'There seems to be little dispute that in July 2009, the Mouras stopped making their payments as set forth in the note. On March 1, 2010, Deutsche Bank foreclosed on the property, and, at a subsequent foreclosure sale, Accredited REO Properties, LLC, purchased the property for $125,000. In July 2010, Vericrest executed a foreclosure deed on behalf of Deutsche Bank, which Accredited REO subsequently recorded with the City of Warwick.', 'On March 14, 2011, plaintiffs filed a two-count complaint seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. In their prayers for relief, plaintiffs asked the court to quiet title to the property, and they sought a nine-point declaration, including orders declaring that plaintiffs were the owners of the property as a matter of law, that the foreclosure sale, conveyance, and assignment were void, and that defendants pay plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees. On November 8, 2012, 4', 'Attached to defendants’ motion for summary judgment is a document entitled “Corporate Resolution.” This document illustrates that, on April 2, 2008, several individuals, who were listed on separate sheets of paper, were employees of Vericrest Financial and were appointed as vice presidents of MERS with the authority to “execute such documents as may be necessary to fulfill the Member’s servicing obligations to the beneficial owners of such mortgage loan.” Hal Bartow was one of those Vericrest employees appointed as a vice president of MERS. 5', 'In a document entitled “Limited Power of Attorney” submitted to the Superior Court in support of the motion, Deutsche Bank appears to have appointed Vericrest Financial on June 24, 2010 as the Trust’s attorney-in-fact and servicer for “any of the mortgages or deeds of trust.” This document references an April 1, 2009 “Servicing Agreement” between Deutsche Bank and Vericrest, and indicates that in the servicing agreement Vericrest is the “Servicer.”', '-3- after both sides had conducted discovery, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In addition to other documentation, defendants filed two affidavits to support the motion: one from Asher and another from Dean Ponte, a licensed auctioneer who conducted the foreclosure sale on behalf of Vericrest. To support their objection to the motion, plaintiffs filed a counter-affidavit from Michael Moura. The parties subsequently agreed to waive oral argument, and a justice of the Superior Court rendered a decision on February 27, 2013.', 'The trial justice considered each of the six arguments plaintiffs presented in opposition to summary judgment and found that none presented a genuine issue of material fact. During his consideration of the arguments, the trial justice addressed defendants’ argument that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage because the Mouras contended that Bartow lacked authority to assign the mortgage on behalf of MERS. The trial justice stated that he did not believe plaintiffs had standing to make such a challenge, but that even if he were to find that they did, he nonetheless concluded that plaintiffs’ argument was without merit because the assignment was signed by Bartow and because the certification that he was a vice president of MERS was acknowledged by a notary. That notarized assignment was recorded in the land evidence records, which, in the trial justice’s opinion, amounted to “presumptive evidence” that Bartow had the authority to sign, an assertion that plaintiffs had not challenged with competent evidence. After considering the submissions of the parties, the trial justice granted the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a timely appeal to this Court. 6 6', 'In April 2013, this Court decided Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069 (R.I. 2013), which addressed several of the arguments the Mouras have presented on appeal. Consequently, on December 17, 2013, when the Mouras came before a single justice of this Court pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A(3) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure,', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We review a trial justice’s granting of summary judgment de novo. Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 532 (R.I. 2013). “Examining the case from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, ‘[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[,] we will affirm the judgment.’” Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406-07 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 150 (R.I. 2012)). “Although summary judgment is recognized as an extreme remedy, * * * to avoid summary judgment the burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that ‘prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]’” Id. at 407 (quoting Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012)). “[T]he nonmoving party * * * cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532 (quoting Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013)). Demonstrating mere factual disputes will not defeat summary judgment; “the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). plaintiffs were directed to file a supplemental memorandum within twenty days discussing the effect of Bucci on the issues raised in this appeal. The plaintiffs’ counsel failed to comply with the order of this Court and never filed the required supplemental memorandum. At oral argument, plaintiffs’ counsel was unable to articulate any reasonable explanation as to why he did not adhere to the order. The general, plenary supervisory power of this Court authorizes us to dismiss an appeal if a party fails to follow a duly issued order. See Santos v. Smith, 99 R.I. 430, 431-32, 208 A.2d 524, 525 (1965) (declining to dismiss certiorari petition for not complying with a statutory provision, but retaining authority to decide differently in the future). Although we choose not to dismiss this appeal for noncompliance with the Court’s order, we are nevertheless dismayed by counsel’s unexplained disregard for our directive.', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The plaintiffs discharge a volley of arguments on appeal that they contend demonstrate the trial justice’s error in granting summary judgment. First, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice erred when he allowed Asher’s affidavit into evidence. Second, plaintiffs maintain that there is a material issue of fact surrounding the validity of the travel of the note and the mortgage. Third, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred when he found that MERS had properly assigned the mortgage to Deutsche Bank. Finally, plaintiffs claim that the trial justice erred when he found that the foreclosure sale had been lawfully noticed and conducted. In our opinion, these arguments are unpersuasive and without merit.', 'The Mouras begin by parsing the trial justice’s bench decision into eighteen alleged errors that the trial justice committed in granting summary judgment. Of note, for our purposes, plaintiffs take issue with the trial justice’s statement that he did not believe plaintiffs had standing to challenge the assignment even though he went on to analyze the argument assuming they did have standing. Indeed, although standing was contested below, before this Court, defendants make it clear that they do not dispute plaintiffs’ standing to challenge the assignment.', 'We pause to note, however, that we agree with the trial justice that standing was problematic in this case.', 'This Court first addressed the issue of a plaintiff’s standing to challenge an assignment of a mortgage in Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532. In Mruk, we created an exception to the general rule that third parties do not have standing to challenge a contract and held that “homeowners in Rhode Island have standing to challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.” Id. at 536. However, we cautioned that this holding on standing was to be narrowly construed', '-6- and limited only to those situations in which a mortgagor challenges an “‘invalid, ineffective, or void’ assignment of the mortgage.” Id. (quoting Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 708 F.3d 282, 291 (1st Cir. 2013)). More specifically, we agreed with the First Circuit that mortgagors do not have standing to challenge “shortcomings in an assignment that render it merely voidable at the election of one party but otherwise effective to pass legal title.” Id. (quoting Culhane, 708 F.3d at 291).', 'Earlier this year, in a case based on Massachusetts law, the First Circuit expounded upon the difference between standing to challenge a void assignment and an assignment that is merely voidable. Wilson v. HSBC Mortgage Services, Inc., 744 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2014). The court said that a mortgagor would lack standing to challenge an assignment that is voidable because “even successfully proving that the assignment was voidable would not affect the rights as between those two parties or provide the homeowner with a defense to the foreclosure action.” Id. A “void” contract, the court explained, was a “nullity,” “incapable of confirmation or ratification.” Id. (quoting Allis v. Billings, 47 Mass. 415, 417 (1843)). On the other hand, a “voidable” contract affects the rights of one party and may be either ratified or rescinded at that party’s election. Id. Moreover, the court did not take as “gospel” the mortgagor’s bald assertion that the assignment was void, but analyzed the materials before the court to determine whether the assignment was properly categorized as void or voidable. Id. at 10. The mortgagors in Wilson, 744 F.3d at 11, claimed the assignment was void and supported that assertion with allegations that bear a striking resemblance to the position taken here by the Mouras. Ultimately, the court in Wilson determined that the mortgagors did not have standing to challenge the assignment because they had not proven that the assignment was void. Id. at 14. Although the issue of standing is a threshold inquiry that the Court may decide before reaching the merits of a', '-7- claim, Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State, 81 A.3d 1106, 1110 (R.I. 2014), because standing was neither briefed nor argued by the parties and was assumed to be present by the trial justice, we too will credit plaintiffs with standing and will proceed to decide the case on its merits. However, in principle, we find the reasoning in Wilson to be persuasive.', 'The first argument before us is plaintiffs’ claim that the trial justice erred in admitting the affidavit of Eduardo Asher. The plaintiffs claim that Asher, as an assistant vice president of Vericrest, did not offer any evidence of a contractual relationship between Vericrest and any other party.', 'Furthermore, plaintiffs claim that Asher’s statement in paragraph one of the affidavit is insufficient to satisfy Rule 803(6) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 7 It should be noted that Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires supporting and opposing affidavits to be made on personal knowledge, setting forth facts admissible into evidence, and affirmatively showing that the affiant is competent to testify. The plaintiffs challenge the admissibility of the facts set forth in the Asher affidavit because the affiant claims that Vericrest is a mortgage servicer, but never claims to be the servicer of plaintiffs’ loan. According to plaintiffs, if Vericrest is not the servicer of their loan, then Asher is testifying to 7', 'Rule 803(6) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states:', '“Records of Regularly Conducted Activity. A', 'memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of', 'acts, events, conditions, opinions or diagnoses, made at or near the', 'time by, or from information transmitted by, another person with', 'knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business', 'activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity', 'to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all', 'as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified', 'witness, unless the source of information or the method or', 'circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. The', 'term ‘business’ as used in this paragraph includes business,', 'institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of', 'every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.”', '-8- records not prepared or kept by Vericrest, which means Asher’s statements are not based on his personal knowledge. Although it is true that Asher does not say that Vericrest is the servicer of the note, that does not cause us to conclude that plaintiff’s position is sound. Asher swears that the claims in his affidavit are based on personal knowledge, that Vericrest is a mortgage servicer, and that the note is held by Vericrest. These three statements, along with others, convince us that the affidavit was proper because Asher’s averments satisfy the strictures of Rule 56(e). See Textron, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 723 A.2d 1138, 1144 (R.I. 1999) (discussing sufficiency of personal knowledge presented in affidavits in support of motion for summary judgment).', 'Next, the Mouras assert that defendants cannot prove a legal foreclosure occurred because the evidence submitted did not demonstrate the presence of a valid travel of the note and mortgage. To support this argument, plaintiffs present a disorganized mélange of conclusory statements that purportedly undergird a claim that there is a genuine issue of material fact. We, however, are convinced that the record presents a clear chain of title beginning with Accredited Home Lenders and concluding with REO Properties. The evidence and supporting documents, including the Asher Affidavit, establish that Michael Moura signed the note, that the note was signed in favor of Accredited Home Lenders, which endorsed an allonge in blank, and that it was subsequently held by Vericrest Financial on behalf of Deutsche Bank. Further, MERS properly assigned the mortgage through its duly authorized representative to Deutsche Bank, and the assignment was recorded with the City of Warwick.', 'To avoid summary judgment, the Mouras, as the nonmoving party, had the burden of producing competent evidence to elucidate a genuine and material factual dispute. See Sullo, 68 A.3d at 407. In the counter-affidavit submitted by plaintiffs, Michael Moura attests that he was', '-9- told by MERS that Bartow, who signed the assignment from MERS to Deutsche Bank, was never an employee of MERS. Moura further swears that Bartow is a known “robosigner,” and he attached a list that includes Bartow among other known “robosigners” from the South Essex District Registry of Deeds in Massachusetts. However, in the papers submitted to the trial justice and to this Court, the Mouras do not develop these diffuse claims into a cogent argument, explain their significance, or even make further mention of Bartow. Mere allegations and conclusions will not create a factual dispute sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532.', 'The plaintiffs’ remaining arguments challenge the assignment of the mortgage to Deutsche Bank. First, the Mouras maintain that MERS did not have the authority to assign the mortgage. Second, the plaintiffs contend that the foreclosure was invalid because there were no valid assignments that would have granted the proper interest to foreclose. This Court already has addressed the issue of the authority of MERS to assign a mortgage in Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank FSB, 68 A.3d 1069 (R.I. 2013). Because the plaintiffs did not distinguish their arguments from our decision in Bucci, as they were ordered to do, we need not, and do not, address those arguments further.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

50,Ricardo Ramirez : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 2, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. Ricardo Ramirez (Ramirez or applicant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying his application for postconviction relief. On appeal, Ramirez argues that the hearing justice erred (1) by failing to make findings of fact pursuant to this Court’s holding in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000); (2) by not allowing Ramirez an opportunity to be heard on the merits of his application before allowing the appointed attorney to withdraw; and (3) by declining to consider the applicant’s motion to reduce sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties’ arguments, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that the issues presented may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 26, 2002, Ramirez was found guilty of first-degree murder after a jury trial.1 He was later sentenced to a term of life imprisonment, with an additional twenty-five years to serve consecutively, pursuant to the habitual offender statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21. Ramirez appealed his conviction, and in December 2007, this Court affirmed the judgment. State v. Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254, 1257 (R.I. 2007).', 'On April 23, 2009, Ramirez filed a pro se application for postconviction relief in the Superior Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, in which he claimed to have received ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial on the underlying murder charge.2 Contemporaneous with the application for postconviction relief, Ramirez also filed a motion to appoint counsel; this motion initially was denied. However, on February 25, 2010, counsel was appointed for the limited purpose of investigating Ramirez’s postconviction-relief claims, in light of this Court’s holding in Shatney. Counsel later filed with the Superior Court a “Report to the Court of Counsel’s Investigation of Post Conviction Claims of Petitioner” (Shatney report).', 'On May 24, 2010, a hearing was held before the Superior Court justice who had presided at applicant’s criminal trial. At this hearing, counsel referenced the contents of the Shatney report, and stated:', '“Your Honor, I have reviewed the entire record and', 'encouraged Mr. Ramirez’s input to my report, and I go into', 'significant detail about his counsel’s effectiveness. I list numerous 1', 'The facts of this case were previously detailed in our opinion affirming Ramirez’s conviction, State v. Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254 (R.I. 2007). It is therefore unnecessary for us to repeat them here. 2', 'Specifically, Ramirez asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to ask for an evidentiary hearing regarding the availability of a witness and in failing to ask the state to grant immunity to a witness. Ramirez also contended that a witness for the state had since provided Ramirez with a sworn statement recanting his prior testimony.', '-2-', 'things that his counsel did for him. I looked into the theories of', 'prosecutorial misconduct as well as newly-discovered evidence', 'and the sum and substance of my report’s that the level of', 'assistance provided to Mr. Ramirez was, in fact, effective and that', 'there’s no way I can meet the threshold required by', 'Strickland[ v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)], and so I don’t', 'believe he is entitled to counsel for the purpose of pursuing his', 'post-conviction case in order to vacate the conviction.” Counsel then requested that the court permit her to withdraw her appearance on Ramirez’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, counsel asked that she be allowed to represent Ramirez for the sole purpose of filing—admittedly out of time—a motion to reduce sentence in accordance with Rule 35. Over the state’s objection, and despite the trial justice’s “grave reservation,” the court requested that counsel provide further briefing on the court’s equitable authority to entertain a Rule 35 motion past the 120-day time period specified in the rule. The trial justice further stated that the court would “accept the findings of [counsel] in the Shatney report,” and informed Ramirez that, in order to pursue his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have to proceed pro se. After this hearing, Ramirez filed an objection to counsel’s Shatney report and disputed counsel’s assertion that a Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence may be permissible, and requested that the court “appoint him competent counsel to represent his postconviction issues.”', 'On June 22, 2010, counsel submitted a memorandum, citing this Court’s opinion in Ballard v. State, 983 A.2d 264 (R.I. 2009), arguing that the Rhode Island Post Conviction Remedy Act, chapter 9.1 of title 10, provides a court with the “ability to vacate the sentence in part or effectively reduce the sentence * * * [with] the only requisite being the interest of justice.”', 'On July 7, 2010, the state filed a motion to dismiss Ramirez’s application for postconviction relief, as well as an objection to counsel’s motion to reduce sentence.', '-3-', 'On July 12, 2010, another hearing was held, at which the trial justice denied Ramirez’s motion to reduce sentence and allowed counsel to withdraw from the case. The trial justice reserved decision on the state’s motion to dismiss and set another hearing date, in order to give Ramirez time to decide whether to proceed pro se, retain private counsel, or withdraw his application for postconviction relief. The hearing on the state’s motion to dismiss subsequently was held on October 5, 2010. Ramirez appeared pro se and requested summary judgment based on nine postconviction-relief issues that he read into the record from a prepared statement. After the state addressed each of applicant’s contentions, the trial justice asked applicant if he wished to respond; Ramirez declined. In his bench decision, the trial justice noted that the attorney who prepared the Shatney report was appointed “as an independent officer of the [c]ourt to investigate [applicant’s] initial allegations.” The trial justice continued, stating:', '“And as I told you at the time of her appointment, because a lot of', 'petitioners are under the impression that this person is representing', '[their] interests, I told you [counsel] is representing the Court to', 'make an independent investigation regarding the allegations that', 'you have raised. Her report, as you know * * * was a negative', 'report.” At the end of the hearing the trial justice denied and dismissed Ramirez’s application for postconviction relief, and judgment was entered. Ramirez filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to chapter 9.1 of title 10, the statutory remedy of postconviction relief is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.” Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 453 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 1016 (R.I. 2008)). When faced with the grant or denial of postconviction relief, “[t]his Court will not disturb a trial', '-4- justice’s factual findings made on an application for post-conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.” Young v.

However, we review “questions of fact concerning infringement of constitutional rights, and mixed questions of law and fact with constitutional implications, de novo.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 454.', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Ramirez argues that the trial justice did not follow the appropriate procedure mandated by Shatney, a contention that is not disputed by the state. Specifically, Ramirez claims that the trial justice did not place on the record an assessment, or findings of fact, regarding whether counsel’s conclusions were justified. Ramirez also contends that the trial justice erred by allowing counsel to withdraw after accepting the Shatney report, and claims that he was entitled to be heard on the merits of the report while represented by counsel. Finally, Ramirez argues that he was entitled to have his Rule 35 motion for reduction of sentence considered, and claims that the trial justice erred by summarily dismissing the motion as being untimely.', 'As set forth by this Court in Shatney, an applicant for postconviction relief “has the right to court-appointed assistance of counsel if he or she is indigent, unless a previous application involving the same issue or issues has been finally determined adversely to the applicant.”3 Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. This mandate derives from Rhode Island’s Post Conviction Remedy Act, specifically § 10-9.1-5, which states in part that “[a]n applicant who is indigent shall be entitled to be represented by the public defender.', 'If the public defender is excused from 3', 'Consequently, “the inquiry into whether an indigent postconviction-relief applicant is entitled to counsel and a hearing should focus, at least in part, on how many applications have been filed.” Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 458 (R.I. 2012).', '-5- representing the applicant because of a conflict of interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation, the court shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” Once counsel has been appointed to represent an indigent applicant, “[t]he hallmarks of a meaningful attorney-client relationship thus arise, including zealous advocacy and the protection of the applicant’s confidences.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 454-55. Accordingly, “[t]he point in time at which a trial court may determine that a * * * petitioner’s claims are frivolous or meritless is after the petitioner has been afforded a full, fair, and counselled opportunity to present those claims.” Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135 (quoting Commonwealth v. Harris, 553 A.2d 428, 433 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989)).', 'This Court has clarified that “[n]either Shatney nor its progeny contemplates the appointment of an ‘objective’ or ‘independent’ lawyer who does not represent the applicant,” and that “[g]enerally, Shatney considerations should arise after counsel has been appointed in accordance with § 10-9.1-5 and the applicant has been provided with a meaningful discussion with counsel about the issues that may or may not be suitable grounds for postconviction relief.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 456. In Campbell, we explained that “[§] 10-9.1-5 cannot be satisfied with anything less than a meaningful attorney-client relationship between appointed counsel and his or her client.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455. Accordingly, we now reiterate that a “trial justice’s appointment of an ‘objective attorney’ to make an ‘independent evaluation’ of the merits of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel violat[es] § 10-9.1-5.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 457.', 'In the case at bar, the state concedes that the trial justice did not follow the requisite procedure and that Ramirez was not provided with appointed counsel as required by § 10-9.1-5. Accordingly, we conclude that both the state and Ramirez are correct in their contention that a remand is necessary to provide Ramirez with a meaningful opportunity to present his', '-6- postconviction claims in the first instance. We are not, however, persuaded by the state’s argument that Ramirez should not be afforded an opportunity to present his Rule 35 argument in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because, the state contends, the trial justice decided that issue. Although the filing of a Rule 35 motion is time-barred, we are of the opinion that Ramirez should have the opportunity to present—while represented by counsel— whatever claims may be available to him in this, his first application for postconviction relief, including that he was deprived of the assistance of counsel at the Rule 35 stage, after this Court affirmed his conviction.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court with directions to appoint counsel to Ramirez in accordance with § 10-9.1-5 for investigation and, if appropriate, litigation of the applicant’s allegations.

51,Maria Marble : v. : John Faelle et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The plaintiff, Maria Marble (Marble or plaintiff), suffered injuries when she was struck by a vehicle operated by the defendant John Faelle (Faelle), owned by the defendant Hertz Corporation (Hertz), and purportedly rented to the defendant Anthony Carroccio (Carroccio).1', 'Hertz filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that it did not consent to Faelle’s operation of the vehicle and that, alternatively, a federal statute, 49 U.S.C. § 30106, known as the Graves Amendment, precludes recovery against Hertz. The Superior Court justice granted Hertz’s motion. We reverse and remand for trial.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 28, 2007, Marble exited a Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) bus, which had been traveling southbound on Reservoir Avenue in Cranston. It was about 7 p.m.; she was dressed in black, and she attempted to cross the street, west to east, without using a crosswalk. When she reached the northbound lane, Marble was struck by a 2007 Dodge Charger registered to Hertz and driven by Faelle. According to one witness, the force of the 1', 'The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is also a named defendant.', '-1- accident caused Marble to go onto the hood of the car and then land hard on the pavement. Marble was taken to the emergency room, where hospital staff determined that she had non-life- threatening injuries.', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint against Faelle in June 2008. In later amendments to the complaint, she added Hertz, RIPTA, and Carroccio as defendants. Hertz denied the allegations, and included lack of consent as an affirmative defense in its answer. In 2009, Hertz brought its first motion for summary judgment, which was denied without prejudice by a justice of the Superior Court. Hertz brought a second motion for summary judgment in 2011, which was decided by a second justice of the Superior Court. In that motion, Hertz contended that it did not consent to Faelle’s operation of the vehicle and, alternatively, that 49 U.S.C. § 30106, the Graves Amendment, precludes recovery against it. To support its motion, Hertz attached five exhibits to its memorandum. Exhibit A was a “rental record” between Hertz and Carroccio. Exhibit B was the Operator Information Sheet from the Cranston Police Department relating to the accident. Exhibit C was a “rental agreement,” purporting to contain the terms and conditions of Carroccio’s rental.', 'Exhibit D was the affidavit of Stephen P. Camerano (the Camerano affidavit), which had one exhibit attached to it.2 Exhibit E was Faelle’s statement included in the accident report.', 'The documents most key to this appeal are the rental record and the Camerano affidavit. The rental record reflects that, on December 18, 2007, Carroccio rented a vehicle from Hertz, which he was to return on January 1, 2008. The vehicle listed, however, is a 2008 Toyota Prius. Nonetheless, the Camerano affidavit asserts that “pursuant to the rental record attached hereto 2', 'Two things about exhibit D are noteworthy. First, the exhibit attached to the affidavit is the same document as exhibit A attached to the memorandum (the rental record), minus the first page. Second, on the second page of Hertz’s supporting memorandum (the pages are unnumbered), exhibit D is described as “the Affidavit of Juan Samayoa.”', '-2- Anthony Carroccio rented a 2007 Dodge Charger from Hertz * * *.” With respect to the issue of Hertz’s consent, the four-page rental record states, “No ‘additional authorized operators’ without our prior written approval.”', 'Additionally, the section of the rental record delineating the estimated charges for the rental provided that “fees for any additional authorized operators [are] not included”; the corresponding line omits a dollar figure, unlike other lines. Finally, the terms and conditions of the “rental agreement” exhibit contain the following provision:', '“Who May Operate the Car', 'Only You and the following persons, with Your permission', '(‘Authorized Operators’), may operate the Car: * * * (c) for rentals', 'other than Replacement Rentals, any other person who meets', 'Hertz’s qualifications and who signs an Additional Authorized', 'Operator form at the time of rental or who is authorized under', 'Your Hertz CDP number, if any, shown on the Rental Record.”3 Hertz argued that these documents establish that it did not consent to Faelle’s operation of the 2007 Dodge Charger that struck plaintiff.', 'Alternatively, Hertz argued that that 49 U.S.C. § 30106, the Graves Amendment, preempts G.L. 1956 § 31-34-4; thus, it precludes the vicarious liability of Hertz as the owner of the vehicle.', 'The plaintiff argued that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding Hertz’s consent, making summary judgment inappropriate.', 'Specifically, plaintiff pointed to the inconsistency in the documents that Hertz submitted: the rental record described a Toyota Prius, while the vehicle involved in the accident was a Dodge Charger. Further, plaintiff relied on RIPTA’s argument that the Graves Amendment did not preempt § 31-34-4, and also asserted that there were genuine issues relating to the applicability of the Graves Amendment. After hearing argument, the Superior Court justice merely stated, “I’m going to grant [Hertz’s] motion.” 3', 'The “rental agreement” contains no reference to Carroccio―in fact, “secondary generic” is handwritten on this stock document—and it was not attached to or referenced by the Camerano affidavit.', '-3-', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v.

We examine the case from the same perspective as the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, and we “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party * * *.” Id. at 406-07 (quoting Sacco, 53 A.3d at 150). “Only when a review of the admissible evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party reveals no genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, will this Court uphold the trial justice’s grant of summary judgment.” Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 506 (R.I. 2012) (quoting National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Standen Contracting Co., 942 A.2d 968, 971 (R.I. 2008)). Although the nonmoving party must establish the existence of a disputed issue of material fact, “[s]ummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be applied cautiously.” Hill v. National Grid, 11 A.3d 110, 113 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC v. 1889 Plainfield Pike Realty Corp., 994 A.2d 54, 57 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Analysis', 'Both the plain language of § 31-34-4 and our case law recognize that when the operator of a rental car causes an accident, the liability of the owner of a rental car—absent some independent negligence—is predicated upon the operator having the consent of the owner. Section 31-34-4(a) provides in pertinent part:', '“Any owner of a for hire motor vehicle or truck who has', 'given proof of financial responsibility under this chapter or who in', 'violation of this chapter has failed to give proof of financial', 'responsibility, shall be jointly and severally liable with any person', 'operating the vehicle for any damages caused by the negligence of', '-4-', 'any person operating the vehicle by or with the permission of the', 'owner.” (Emphasis added.) “It is well-established that in order for a rental-car company to be vicariously liable for the negligent operation of its vehicle, § 31-34-4 requires the owner to give permission to the operator.” LaFratta v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 751 A.2d 1281, 1285 (R.I. 2000). Nevertheless, G.L. 1956 § 31-33-7 provides:', '“In all civil proceedings, evidence that at the time of the', 'accident or collision the motor vehicle was registered in the name', 'of the defendant, shall be prima facie evidence that it was being', 'operated with the consent of the defendant, and the absence of', 'consent shall be an affirmative defense to be set up in the answer', 'and proved by the defendant.”', 'This Court’s pronouncements are crystal clear regarding the effect of § 31-33-7 in the summary judgment context. Pichardo v. Stevens, 55 A.3d 762, 766 (R.I. 2012). “[I]n cases where § 31-33-7 is in issue, evidence of vehicle registration ‘cannot be treated as a mere presumption;’ instead, this ‘prima facie evidence remains in the case throughout the trial and is entitled to be weighed like any other evidence upon the question of fact as to consent.’” Pichardo, 55 A.3d at 766 (quoting Kent v. Draper Soap Co., 75 R.I. 30, 36-37, 63 A.2d 571, 575 (1949)).', 'We have held that a defendant-owner’s sworn statements that she did not give permission to a driver involved in a collision involving her car are “relevant to [the defendant- owner’s] attempt to establish [an] affirmative defense under § 31-33-7, but they are not sufficient to prove that defense at the summary judgment stage.” Pichardo, 55 A.3d at 766 (quoting Andreoni v. Ainsworth, 898 A.2d 1240, 1244 (R.I. 2006)). Only in a “rare and exceptional case” can a defendant-owner prove the affirmative defense of lack of consent as a matter of law under § 31-33-7. Pichardo, 55 A.3d at 766-67 (quoting Hill v. Cabral, 62 R.I. 11, 19, 2 A.2d 482, 485 (1938)).', '-5-', 'Here, Hertz has failed to show that this is such a “rare and exceptional” case. The exhibits submitted by Hertz are vague and contradictory, and they do not carry the day. Although Hertz submitted a rental record showing Carroccio as the only authorized driver of a vehicle rented from Hertz, that record reflected that Carroccio rented a 2008 Toyota Prius, not the 2007 Dodge Charger that struck plaintiff. Although the Camerano affidavit states that Carroccio rented a 2007 Dodge Charger “pursuant to the rental record attached hereto,” the rental record is inconsistent, describing only the Prius and not the Charger.4 Furthermore, at oral argument, counsel for Hertz admitted that he drafted the affidavit and that the Hertz employee who signed it was not the actual person who conducted the transaction, but rather a Hertz employee who obtained a copy of the rental record from Hertz’s computer system. Additionally, we note that exhibit C, the rental agreement, which purports to contain the terms and conditions of Carroccio’s rental, contains no reference to Carroccio, and the Camerano affidavit does not address it. Therefore, the record does not establish that Faelle was operating the 2007 Dodge Charger without Hertz’s consent, particularly in light of plaintiff’s statutory prima facie proof under § 31-33-7. Accordingly, Hertz’s consent remains an issue of material fact.', 'Hertz relies heavily upon LaFratta, 751 A.2d at 1283, 1285—a case in which we affirmed the grant of summary judgment to a rental car company with similar terms to the purported rental agreement and rental record here. In LaFratta, 751 A.2d at 1284, however, “the rental agreement provided the requisite proof [of lack of consent].” Such is not the case here; the rental record submitted by Hertz is insufficient because it does not describe the vehicle involved in the accident with plaintiff. Hertz also seizes upon a footnote of dictum in Pichardo, 55 A.3d at 767 4', 'The Camerano affidavit is inconsistent with the copy of the rental record attached as exhibit A to Hertz’s memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. The copy of the rental record attached to the Camerano affidavit surreptitiously omitted the first page of the record, i.e., the page describing the rented vehicle as a 2008 Toyota Prius.', '-6- n.2, which stated that, when a car rental agency expressly limits who is allowed to drive its vehicle, “summary judgment in favor of a rental agency-defendant would be appropriate because, absent some ambiguity or amendment to the original rental agreement, the plain language of the contract would limit the rental agency’s consent to drivers named in the agreement.” An ambiguity or amendment to the original rental agreement is precisely what we have here—while Hertz purports via affidavit that Carroccio rented a Dodge Charger pursuant to an attached rental record, that rental record reflects only the rental of a Toyota Prius. Accordingly, summary judgment on the basis of Hertz’s lack of consent is not appropriate in this case. See § 31-33-7; Pichardo, 55 A.3d at 766-67. The determination of this issue requires factfinding.', 'Hertz also argued that summary judgment was proper because the Graves Amendment preempts § 31-34-4.', 'However, the issue of fact discussed above also precludes summary judgment on the Graves Amendment issue. The Graves Amendment provides:', '“An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the', 'vehicle to a person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable', 'under the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, by', 'reason of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the', 'owner), for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of', 'the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of', 'the rental or lease, if--', '“(1) the owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in', 'the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and', '“(2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the', 'part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).” 49 U.S.C.', '§ 30106(a). Thus, the Graves Amendment applies only when “harm to persons or property * * * results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease” and there is no negligence by the rental car company. Id. The rental record that Hertz', '-7- attached to its motion is for the rental of a Toyota Prius and not a Dodge Charger. Therefore, the rental record does not establish, for purposes of summary judgment, the period of the rental because it does not identify the vehicle involved in the accident.', 'Accordingly, summary judgment on the basis of the Graves Amendment is not appropriate. See Sola, 45 A.3d at 506. We decline to address the legal merits of the constitutional preemption question. See In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2006) (“Neither this Court nor the Superior Court should decide constitutional issues unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.”).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by permitting the prosecutor to inquire about three prior convictions for assault and, during cross-examination, erred in permitting the prosecutor to reveal that two of the defendant’s prior assault convictions in question were upon police officers. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 4, 2014. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant was charged by information on January 11, 2011 with making threats to a public official (count 1), simple assault and battery (count 2), resisting arrest (count 3), and disorderly conduct (count 4).', '-1-', 'The incident triggering the charges occurred on the evening of October 26, 2010 in Cranston, Rhode Island. It began with a dispute between defendant and his neighbor, Ms. Irene Ferreira. According to defendant, he and his neighbor had been “feuding” for over a decade. Each had called the police on the other party in the past. On the evening in question, defendant testified that the dispute was nothing more than an exchange of childish words and that he was not angry. Ferreira, however, asserted that defendant was yelling in an outrageous tone that left her fearful for her life, prompting her to call 911 at around 6 p.m., requesting that a police officer be sent to her home.', 'The interactions between the police officer who responded to Ferreira’s 911 call and defendant resulted in defendant being charged with the aforementioned criminal charges. A jury trial was conducted in the Providence County Superior Court over the course of four days between March 14, 2012 and March 20, 2012.', 'A', 'The Trial', '1', 'Officer Salvatore’s Testimony', 'At trial, Officer Donald K. Salvatore, Jr. testified that, just before 6 p.m., he was dispatched to the home of defendant because “there was a Tom Mercurio at that residence [who was] out of control.” Officer Salvatore, in uniform, arrived at defendant’s house in a marked police car. The testimony of defendant and that of Officer Salvatore diverge from the time of their initial encounter. Officer Salvatore stated that, as the front door of defendant’s residence was open and the storm door was shut, and seeing a male and a female in the kitchen area, he knocked on the storm door. When they did not acknowledge him, he opened the storm door,', '-2- stepped on the threshold, and yelled, “Hello.”', 'The man asked who the officer was; after identifying himself as a Cranston police officer, Officer Salvatore asked the man if he was Tom. At this time, another man later identified as Thomas Mercurio “came running from the right side of the home” and began yelling, asking the officer if he had a warrant. Officer Salvatore described Mercurio as “irate” or “pretty upset.”', 'The officer testified that, at that time, he was standing on the threshold and had one foot inside of the home. Officer Salvatore explained that he asked defendant to come outside to talk, and they both stepped outside to the front stairway, with the officer standing approximately two feet away from defendant. After stepping outside, defendant said, “That f---ing neighbor.” When he then asked defendant if he had any guns or knives on him, defendant angrily said, “F--- this,” pushed him in the chest, and retreated back into the home.', 'Officer Salvatore testified that he then pursued defendant into the house, entering the landing between the first and second floors. He tried to grab defendant and repeatedly told defendant that he was under arrest. He testified that, because defendant was “flailing his arms” and “trying to kick,” defendant’s momentum caused him to trip down the stairs and fall sideways to the lower level. He then ran down the stairs and grabbed defendant, who was still kicking and punching in an apparent attempt to get away. According to Officer Salvatore, defendant was still swinging and kicking towards him before Officer Salvatore had his whole body on top of the face-down defendant, continually telling defendant that he was under arrest. He testified that defendant put his hands underneath his body after defendant was on his stomach and Officer Salvatore was on top of him. At this time, while trying to grab defendant’s left arm, Officer Salvatore first became aware that two other Cranston patrolmen, Officers Aldrich and Escobar, had arrived. Officers Salvatore and Aldrich grabbed defendant’s arms and handcuffed him.', '-3-', 'Officer Salvatore testified that, as he escorted defendant to the police car, defendant was “yelling the whole time[,]” as were members of his family. He stated that defendant was “very tense when [Officer Salvatore] was getting him into the car, [and defendant] continued to call me a yellow bastard.” According to him, defendant screamed and threatened to kill him while he walked defendant to the police car.', '2', 'Officer Aldrich’s Testimony', 'Officer Seth Aldrich testified that he also received the dispatch shortly before 6 p.m. and arrived at defendant’s residence soon after Officer Salvatore. He testified that he was in the street, about twenty-five to thirty feet away, when he observed Officer Salvatore speaking with Mercurio. He did not hear much of what was said but did hear Officer Salvatore state that he would rather speak with Mercurio outside. He stated that Officer Salvatore was standing on the outside front steps of the house while Mercurio was standing in the open doorway. Officer Aldrich did not see defendant strike Officer Salvatore; he did see defendant quickly turn towards Officer Salvatore and re-enter the house and Officer Salvatore run into the house after him. Officer Aldrich then ran into the house, and “observed Officer Salvatore and * * * defendant wrestling on the [lower-level] floor.” He stated that defendant was “lying on his stomach with his hands underneath his chest [and that he] attempted to get [defendant’s] right arm from underneath him [as] Officer Salvatore was on [defendant’s] left side.” Officer Aldrich stated that he handcuffed defendant after a “brief struggle.” During this time, defendant yelled toward his family members to get the video camera while saying that the officers should not have been in his home. Officer Aldrich followed behind Officer Salvatore and observed him secure defendant in the police cruiser. Officer Aldrich did not observe defendant kick, scream vulgarities, threaten', '-4- to kill Officer Salvatore, or otherwise cause problems either in the house or as he was being secured in the cruiser. Notably, Officer Aldrich was not questioned as to whether he heard Officer Salvatore inform defendant that defendant was under arrest.', '3', 'The Defendant’s Testimony', 'The defendant gave a different version of the events. He stated that, at the time Officer Salvatore arrived, he was eating dinner at the kitchen table with his mother, brother, and sister. According to defendant, his family’s dinner was interrupted when they heard someone open the door and ask for “Todd.” He became upset on seeing a police officer completely inside the house, with his foot on a stair and hand on the railing. He testified that he first asked Officer Salvatore “what he was doing in our home[,]” to which Officer Salvatore did not respond. When defendant next asked if the officer had a warrant, Officer Salvatore only responded by saying, “Just come down, I want to talk to you.” The defendant then came down the stairway while pointing his finger at Officer Salvatore and telling him to leave. He stated that he was angry, but did not yell. The defendant then testified that he stopped on one of the first three steps when the officer, standing inside of the home approximately two feet away, grabbed defendant’s right arm and collar, pulling him down the stairs and into the railing. The railing gave way and he fell to the bottom floor on his hands and knees. The defendant then testified that he received a blow to the left side of his rib and that the pain of the blow caused him to lie down flat on the ground. He stated that he received a blow on the left side of his head, and Officer Salvatore then put his knee in defendant’s back. According to defendant, he had both arms under his stomach as a result of the blow but allowed the officer to handcuff him when the officer grabbed his arm. He stated that he and Officer Salvatore did not speak to each other at this point, and that he was not', '-5- told that he was under arrest.

On April 4, 2012, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with thirty days to serve and eleven months suspended with probation. 1 Thereafter, defendant filed a notice of appeal to this Court on April 13, 2012.

He contends that the prosecutor’s questioning exceeded the scope of defendant’s testimony on direct and cross-examination. The defendant asserts that the prosecutor “manufactured” the issue of defendant’s respect for police officers in order to be able to bring in these prior convictions.', 'It is axiomatic that cross-examination is generally limited to the scope of the direct examination.

During the cross-examination of defendant, the state first broached the topic of defendant’s like or dislike of the police by inquiring why defendant asked Officer Salvatore “Do you have a warrant?” and why he was “angry” that Officer Salvatore was in his home. The defendant explained that “it’s [his] personal understanding and knowledge that the police require a warrant or some type of consent upon entering a dwelling place.” The following exchange then ensued:', '“[The State]: You don’t like the police, do you?', '“[Defendant]: That’s not true.

This Court has since applied this rule concerning the prosecution manufacturing an issue during cross-examination in the context of Rule 404(b) in State v. McDowell, 620 A.2d 94, 95-96 (R.I. 1993).', '- 11 - The trial justice overruled an objection made by defense counsel. The defendant was thus permitted to answer.', '“[Defendant]: I respect law and order, yes, I do.', '“[The State]: You respect law and order?', '“[Defendant]: Yes, I do.” The cross-examination of defendant then continued, before the following colloquy took place, again regarding defendant’s sentiments about the police:', '“[The State]: You never got angry with the officer * * * and', 'pushed him?', '“[Defendant]: I never said that.', '“[The State]: Because you respect police; right?', '“[Defendant]: I respect law and order, yes, I do.', '“[The State]:', 'And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police', 'officer.', '“[Defendant]: No, I would not.”', 'At a sidebar immediately following this exchange, the state argued that defendant had “opened the door” to the fact that two of his prior convictions for assault involved police officers. The trial justice determined that defendant had “opened the door” to the nature and circumstances surrounding the prior convictions. Therefore, he permitted the state to confront defendant with specific evidence of the prior convictions.', 'This Court has recently been faced with a similar situation involving a prosecutor’s alleged manufacturing of an issue in order to impeach a witness’s testimony in Rosario. In Rosario, 14 A.3d at 207-08, the defendant was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon on a police officer. In ruling upon two motions in limine, the trial justice in Rosario held inter alia', '- 12 - that evidence of one particular previous interaction between the defendant and the police officer who had been the victim of the alleged assault as well as of specific comments that the defendant had made with regard to the police officer would be admissible. Id. at 208-09. The trial justice further held that evidence of “generalized references to threats of assault on police officers in general” would be precluded but noted that her decision on the motions in limine might be changed depending on what the defendant testified to during trial. Id. at 209.', 'At trial, during cross-examination of the defendant, Rosario was asked specifically if he liked the victim-police officer. Rosario, 14 A.3d at 212. The defendant responded, “Yes, I like him. He is an officer. I respect authority.” Id. The prosecutor then asked the defendant for confirmation: “Sir, you testified to this jury under oath that you respect all authority and you respect all Providence police officers; didn’t you say that?” Id. The defendant answered in the affirmative. Id. At this point, the prosecutor questioned the defendant regarding a previous generalized negative statement defendant had made about “all Providence police officers[.]” Id. The trial justice permitted the cross-examination of the defendant to proceed with that line of questioning, finding that the defendant had “opened the door” with his answer that he respected authority. Id. at 212. This Court affirmed the trial justice’s ruling, noting that “[the] defendant chose to answer a question about his attitude towards one person * * * with an extremely broad and unqualified declaration about his respect for authority in general[,]” in holding that defendant had “opened the door” to the rebuttal testimony which followed. Id. at 218.', 'The state relies on Rosario to support its contention that the trial justice did not err in determining that defendant had “opened the door” to being impeached based on his prior convictions for assault on police officers. We are of the opinion, however, that the facts of Rosario are different from the facts here. We emphasize, in particular, that in Rosario it was the', '- 13 - defendant who answered a specific question about one police officer with a broad, generalized statement about his respect for authority. See Rosario, 14 A.3d at 218. In contrast, here, the prosecutor was the first one to ask a broad leading question about defendant’s sentiments towards the police by asking, “You don’t like the police, do you?” 6 Prior to the prosecutor’s asking this question, the defendant had not “opened the door” through any general declarations about his respect for authority. Indeed, we note that in both this first exchange and in the one which followed, it was the prosecutor who persisted in questioning defendant in such broad terms. 7 We conclude that defendant had not “opened the door” to these questions. We find no support in the record for the proposition that defendant had previously volunteered any broad declarations of his respect for either the police or law and order generally so as to “open the door” to the prosecutor’s questions.', 'Our careful review of the record compels us to the conclusion that the repeated broad questions about defendant’s sentiments towards police officers in general elicited a response from defendant which then enabled the state to bring in defendant’s prior convictions of assault against police officers. We are persuaded that these repeated questions constituted improper “manufacturing” of an issue to bring in evidence which the trial justice had previously ruled inadmissible.', 'Our conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that, during the pretrial motion in limine hearing, the prosecutor stated that he would use defendant’s prior convictions only “if the defendant testifies and he gets up there and starts saying he’s a peaceful guy, that he respects police, or something along those lines.” (Emphasis added.) We are struck by the prosecutor’s use of this very phrase in several different permutations during the course of defendant’s cross- 6', 'In phrasing the question thusly, we note that the prosecutor had essentially “painted defendant into a corner” where the only possible response was a broad statement of liking the police. 7', 'As noted above, the prosecutor asked defendant “Because you respect police; right?” and then “And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police officer.”', '- 14 - examination. It was only after broadly leading questions along these lines that the prosecutor directly asked, “And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police officer,” thereby referring obliquely to defendant’s prior convictions in such a way as to lead inevitably to further questions regarding the exact nature of those convictions. We conclude that these questions on cross- examination were improper. 8 Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice erred in permitting the state to impeach defendant’s testimony using his prior convictions of assault against police officers.', 'Finally, this Court will address whether the trial justice’s error was harmless. “In order to meet the harmless-error test, there must be proof ‘beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.’” State v. Smith, 446 A.2d 1035, 1036 (R.I. 1982) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)). This Court has listed various factors to be considered in determining whether an error was harmless,', '“including the relative degree of importance of the witness', 'testimony to the prosecution’s case, ‘* * * the presence or absence', 'of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the', 'witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination', 'otherwise permitted, and * * * the overall strength of the', 'prosecution’s case.’” State v. Bustamante, 756 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I.', '2000) (quoting State v. Texter, 594 A.2d 376, 378 (R.I. 1991)). We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s error in permitting the state to cross-examine the defendant concerning the exact nature of his prior convictions was not harmless. As previously noted, this case was largely devoid of physical evidence, rendering the credibility of each of the witnesses central to the case.', 'We cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the 8', 'We note that we do not believe the prosecutor acted deliberately in improperly cross-examining defendant. Indeed, we are satisfied that the prosecutor was fulfilling his duty as a zealous advocate for the state. We reiterate, however, our admonition in a recent case: “[w]hen a defendant is testifying at his trial, prosecutors and trial justices must be scrupulous to ensure that impeachment of defendant by reference to prior convictions or past criminal conduct is effected in a proper manner * * *.” State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 448 (R.I. 2013).', '- 15 - improper admission into evidence of the defendant’s prior convictions was not overly prejudicial. We are, moreover, especially reluctant to find the improper use of prior convictions to be harmless in the case at bar, when the improper cross-examination occurred to impeach the credibility of the defendant, whose liberty was directly at stake. Because we cannot conclude that the use of the defendant’s prior convictions was harmless, we are perforce required to hold that their admission into evidence was a reversible error. Consequently, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s judgment of conviction is vacated.

On the first prong, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the proffered evidence is “(1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon which it is admissible, [and] (4) of the type which would probably change the verdict at trial.” State v.

Only if these four requirements are satisfied does the trial justice then proceed to the second prong of the analysis where he or she determines if the evidence is sufficiently credible to warrant a new trial. See id. On appeal, we will not overturn a “trial justice’s denial of a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence * * * absent an indication that ‘he or she overlooked or misconceived', '-6- relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” Price, 66 A.3d at 418 (quoting State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 464 (R.I. 2002)).', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice clearly erred in finding that Ms. Rathier’s information about the marshals’ visit to her apartment was not newly discovered evidence. According to defendant, such evidence could not have been discovered prior to trial through a diligent search.', 'He also suggests that the trial justice’s consideration of his motion was perfunctory. The defendant points to the fact that the trial justice did not perform the credibility assessment required under the second prong of the analysis.', '“[A]fter a defendant has had his [or her] day in court and has been fairly tried,” he or she “has a heavy burden” when “seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.” 3 Charles Alan Wright and Sarah H. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 583 at 445 (4th ed. 2011).', 'For a defendant to satisfy his burden of showing that information could not have previously been discovered through a diligent search, we have ordinarily required the defendant to show that he made a reasonable investigation of evidence which was available to him prior to trial. See, e.g., Hazard, 797 A.2d at 465 (the defendant “failed to demonstrate that he exercised the requisite degree of diligence” to obtain alibi evidence where the defendant knew about traffic stop and could have “simply * * * placed a phone call to * * * police barracks”); State v. Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 73 (R.I. 1994) (witness’s testimony did “not pass the threshold test for newly discovered evidence” where defense counsel did not make a diligent attempt to interview witness prior to trial); State v. Brown, 619 A.2d 828, 833 (R.I. 1993) (counsel was aware of compensation statute and could have obtained evidence prior to trial by inquiring at clerk’s office); State v. Sullivan, 83 R.I. 1, 4, 111 A.2d 838, 840-41 (1955) (diligence not shown where', '-7- counsel neither made inquiries about bus ticket found in the defendant’s possession nor alleged that he was prevented from making such inquiries).', 'Here, Ms. Rathier’s second interview was among the evidence available to defendant prior to trial. The state suggests that Ms. Rathier’s second interview contains nearly all of the information that defendant alleges to be “newly discovered.”', 'At the time of the second interview, defendant was still a fugitive. The state points to a portion of that interview where Det. Otrando asked Ms. Rathier, “If [defendant] contacts you, are you gonna call me?” Ms. Rathier responded:', '“I’ll call you. I won’t call that other guy. * * * I don’t like * * *', 'them, the way they approached me. He came in my house,', 'threatening me. I had to RE-COOPERATE. They rang the', 'doorbell. I opened the door for them. ‘I SMELL WEED.’ * * *', '[i]t’s better than going around shooting people. Big deal. So, they', 'come in and they, they start lifting up my papers, ‘Oh, we should', 'lock her up right now.’ This and that. * * * We’re gonna send you', 'TO INDIANA. * * * I’m like, ‘You think I don’t understand the', 'severity? You think I, I’m stupid to all this?’ * * * I’m already', 'nervous of him. You make me nervous of you. * * * Like, you’re', 'asking me to help you, but if you’re INAUDIBLE, and I won’t be', 'able to, like, you know, get through the next day. And * * * I', 'actually had to call him three days later. And go[], ‘Listen, are you', 'guys gonna, like, come bust in my house again?’ INAUDIBLE.”', '(Capitalization in original.)', 'The defendant stresses that this passage from Ms. Rathier’s statement lacks clarity. We agree with the state, however, that a careful reader who made a reasonable effort to follow up on this excerpt could have unearthed all of the information which defendant claims is newly discovered. Ms. Rathier’s response to Det. Otrando reveals that she had been visited at her home by law-enforcement agents seeking her assistance in apprehending defendant. It is also obvious that those law-enforcement agents suspected Ms. Rathier was in possession of marijuana and that Ms. Rathier feared that she might be imprisoned if she did not cooperate. Although Ms. Rathier', '-8- does not explicitly declare that this visit was from the federal marshals, we question whether threats from federal, as compared to state, law enforcement makes any meaningful difference with regard to Ms. Rathier’s alleged bias or motive to lie. Even accepting, however, that the distinction is relevant, Ms. Rathier’s specific reference to being imprisoned in Indiana would suggest to an attentive reader that federal rather than state or local authorities were responsible. Moreover, since defendant was apprehended in Georgia and extradited to Rhode Island, it could not have escaped notice that law enforcement other than the Providence police had been involved in the search.', 'In addition to this information, the record shows that Ms. Rathier also made reference to “state marshals” visiting her apartment when counsel conducted voir dire of Ms. Rathier, before she testified in front of the jury. The prosecutor asked her during voir dire if she had informed the Providence police that defendant had family in Georgia, to which Ms. Rathier responded:', '“No. They told me that [defendant] had family in Georgia, and I', 'said, ‘Yeah, he did say.’ I’m not sure. Maybe I told them, but the', 'state marshals told me that – they’re like, we know he has family', 'in Georgia * * *. * * * And I had told the marshals all this when', 'they came into my apartment * * *.” In this response, Ms. Rathier distinguishes the “state marshals,” who visited her apartment, from “them,” the Providence police. A few questions later, she again referred to her encounter with the marshals:', '“The state marshals were telling me that * * * they had reason to', 'believe [defendant] was either still in Providence, or he was in', 'Georgia, and the detectives were telling me that they believed he', 'was in Pawtucket. Either [the] detectives or the state marshals;', 'they told me they thought he was in Pawtucket * * *.”', '-9- If defendant wanted Ms. Rathier to explain her answer about the “state marshals” or clarify her statement to Det. Otrando, defense counsel could have questioned her about either during voir dire. 9', 'In light of the information contained in Ms. Rathier’s second statement and her answers during voir dire, we conclude that the defendant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that evidence about the marshals’ visit to Ms. Rathier’s apartment could not have previously been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence. Since we hold that the defendant did not satisfy his burden under the first prong of the new-trial analysis, we cannot accept the defendant’s argument that the trial justice prematurely denied his motion by not reaching the second prong. If a defendant fails to satisfy the first component of the two-pronged test for newly discovered evidence, then the trial justice is not required to consider the remaining criteria. See State v. Binns, 732 A.2d 114, 118 (R.I. 1999). In sum, we discern neither clear error nor a misconception of material evidence in the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The record in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. 9', 'Defense counsel did not interview Ms. Rathier prior to trial or hire an investigator to speak with her. The defendant suggested at oral argument that counsel may not have had an opportunity to interview Ms. Rathier. There is nothing in the record to suggest that defense counsel attempted to interview Ms. Rathier but was prevented from doing so. Nonetheless, even if we were to assume that counsel did not have access to Ms. Rathier prior to trial, defense counsel did have an opportunity to question Ms. Rathier before she testified in front of the jury because the trial justice allowed counsel to voir dire Ms. Rathier.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

54,Jean Ho-Rath et al. : v. : Rhode Island Hospital et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. These consolidated appeals, arising from a single medical negligence case, came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised therein should not summarily be decided. Before this Court are four appeals which arise from the entry of separate final judgments in favor of certain defendants in this action. The judgments were entered after a Superior Court hearing on motions to dismiss filed by four groups of defendants, in accordance with Rule 12(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. At issue in each appeal is the application of G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14.1(1), an act that tolls the three-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims when the person claiming injury is a minor.1 After hearing the arguments of counsel and 1', 'In pertinent part, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14.1 provides that', '“an action for medical * * * malpractice shall be commenced within three (3)', 'years from the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the', 'action; provided, however, that:', '-1- carefully examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has been shown in part, and that some, but not all of the issues raised by these appeals may be decided at this time, and that the remaining claims shall be assigned to this Court’s full argument calendar. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the Superior Court judgments entered in favor of defendants Corning Incorporated and Quest Diagnostics, LLC. With respect to the appeals and cross-appeals filed by the plaintiffs and defendants Rhode Island Hospital, Miriam Hospital, Women & Infants Hospital, and each hospital’s associated medical professionals, we direct that the questions raised by these appeals be assigned to the Court’s full argument calendar.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 16, 2010, plaintiffs Jean and Bunsan Ho-Rath, individually and per proxima amici Yendee Ho-Rath (collectively plaintiffs),2 filed suit against numerous defendants, alleging negligence, lack of informed consent, corporate liability, and vicarious liability for injuries sustained by their minor daughter Yendee, who was born on January 9, 1998, with alpha thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a 124-page, 78-count amended complaint on September 17, 2010, naming twenty-four defendants and three John Doe', '“(1) One who is under disability by reason of age, mental incompetence,', 'or otherwise, and on whose behalf no action is brought within the period of three', '(3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident, shall bring the action', 'within three (3) years from the removal of the disability.', '“(2) In respect to those injuries or damages due to acts of medical * * *', 'malpractice which could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence be', 'discoverable at the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the', 'action, suit shall be commenced within three (3) years of the time that the act or', 'acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been', 'discovered.” 2', 'For the sake of clarity, the individual plaintiffs will be referred to by only their first names; in so doing, we intend no disrespect.', '-2- defendants.3 The gravamen of plaintiffs’ amended complaint is that, although testing for the specific genetic disorder was performed on Jean, Bunsan, and Yendee’s older brother as early as 1993, defendants failed to correctly test, diagnose, and treat plaintiffs, resulting in Yendee manifesting the debilitating genetic disorder at birth.', 'On January 4, 2011, defendant Corning Incorporated (Corning) moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims against it on the ground that such claims were time-barred by the statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1-14.1.4', 'Specifically, Corning argued that Jean and Bunsan’s individual loss of consortium claims—as well as the claims made on behalf of Yendee—were not made within three years of the incident or occurrence giving rise to the suit. Corning also cited to Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 680 (R.I. 1995), in support of the argument that once a medical malpractice action is filed on behalf of a minor, the complaint cannot then be amended to add additional parties outside of the three-year statute of limitations. As a result, Corning argued that all claims against it should be dismissed because the entity was not named in plaintiffs’ original complaint.', 'On February 8, 2011, defendants Rhode Island Hospital, Miriam Hospital, and four associated medical doctors (collectively RIH defendants) filed a motion to dismiss Jean and Bunsan’s derivative claims against those defendants.5 The RIH defendants argued that, although a minor may benefit from the tolling provision found in § 9-1-14.1(1), the statute of limitations is not tolled for the derivative claims of parents. Accordingly, the RIH defendants argued that the 3', 'This opinion will discuss only the parties, facts, and travel that are relevant to the consolidated appeals currently before this Court. 4', 'The plaintiffs’ claims against Corning constitute counts 13 through 16 of the amended complaint; significantly, Corning was not a named defendant in plaintiffs’ initial complaint. 5', 'The plaintiffs’ claims against the RIH defendants make up counts 1 through 4, 37 through 40, 45 through 50, 65 and 66 of the amended complaint.', '-3- parents’ claims for loss of services, companionship, comfort and consortium—although derivative in nature—were time-barred based on the three-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims set forth in § 9-1-14.1.', 'The defendant Women & Infants’ Hospital, along with three associated medical professionals (collectively W&I defendants), filed a motion to dismiss all claims contained in plaintiffs’ amended complaint against those defendants on February 28, 2011.6 In this motion, the W&I defendants argued that the statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims, found in § 9-1-14.1(1)—in conjunction with plaintiffs’ failure to plead the applicable discovery rule contained in § 9-1-14.1(2)—barred the parents’ claims as well as claims made on behalf of Yendee. The W&I defendants further cited to Bakalakis v. Women & Infants’ Hospital, 619 A.2d 1105, 1107 (R.I. 1993), for the proposition that § 9-1-14.1(1) precludes Yendee from filing a complaint on her own behalf once she reaches the age of majority because her parents filed a claim on her behalf prior to that time.', 'On April 13, 2011, Quest Diagnostics, LLC (Quest) moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims against that entity.7 In this motion, Quest argued that the claims contained in the amended complaint solely concerned the analysis of blood tests performed on Bunsan in December 1993, and were therefore time-barred pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1- 14.1(1).', 'Quest also argued—similar to the argument made by the W&I defendants—that because an action had already been filed on Yendee’s behalf while she was a minor, she may not benefit from the tolling provision found in § 9-1-14.1(1) and was therefore precluded from filing suit on her own behalf even after she reached the age of majority. 6', 'The claims against the W&I defendants constitute counts 5 through 8, 59 through 62, and 67 through 70 of the amended complaint. 7', 'The counts contained in plaintiffs’ amended complaint against Quest are 17, 18, 19 and 20.', '-4-', 'The aforementioned motions were heard together before a Superior Court justice on June 27, 2011. In arguing against Rule 12(b) dismissal, plaintiffs posited that § 9-1-14.1(1) suspends the statute of limitations for a minor filing medical malpractice claims up until three years after the child reaches the age of majority. The plaintiffs also argued that, because the parents’ claims are derivative, the statute of limitations for the parents’ loss of consortium claims also are tolled along with the minor child’s underlying medical malpractice claims. Finally, counsel for plaintiffs argued that § 9-1-19—the general disability tolling statute applicable to causes of action other than medical malpractice—rather than § 9-1-14.1(1), would be the operative statute in regard to defendants Corning and Quest, whose services strictly were limited to laboratory testing and analysis.', 'The trial justice rendered a bench decision on all motions on July 7, 2011. The trial justice determined that all of plaintiffs’ claims, both direct and derivative, sounded in medical malpractice and were therefore governed by § 9-1-14.1. Based on her reading of § 9-1-14.1(1), the trial justice determined that two options were available to a minor seeking to commence a medical malpractice action: either an action could be commenced on behalf of the child within three years of the injury—or reasonable discovery of the injury—or the injured minor could bring suit on his or her own behalf within three years of attaining the age of majority. The trial justice therefore concluded that all of plaintiffs’ claims were time-barred, because those allegations of injury had arisen more than three years before the action was commenced in 2010, and because plaintiffs did not plead any applicable discovery rule which would account for such delay.', 'Specifically concerning Corning and Quest, the trial justice found that, because plaintiffs added those entities more than three years after any testing or diagnosis which could give rise to', '-5- a cause of action, the claims against those entities also were barred. Finally, the trial justice held that the child retained the right to bring suit on her own behalf when she reached the age of majority, and up to three years thereafter. Final judgments subsequently entered on behalf of these defendants pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs and Corning, Quest, and W&I defendants each filed a timely and separate appeal.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]he sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Narragansett Electric Co. v.

Yakavonis, 966 A.2d 1231, 1233 (R.I. 2009)). “We thus are confined to the four corners of the complaint and must assume all allegations are true, resolving any doubts in plaintiff’s favor.” Id. (citing Laurence, 788 A.2d at 456). This Court will affirm a trial justice’s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss “when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiffs claim.” Tarzia v. State, 44 A.3d 1245, 1251 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Palazzo v.

The plaintiffs also contend that, in accordance', '-6- with § 9-1-41,8 the parents must bring all derivative claims at the same time that a child’s claims are advanced, regardless of when the complaint is filed. On the other hand, Corning, Quest, and the RIH and W&I defendants contend that the trial justice correctly dismissed Jean and Bunsan’s derivative claims, but argue that she erred in interpreting § 9-1-14.1(1) to allow Yendee to bring an action on her own behalf when she reaches the age of majority.', 'Examining the parties’ arguments as a whole, this Court is confronted with two issues of first impression: whether, in accordance with § 9-1-14.1(1), medical malpractice claims may be brought on a child’s behalf at any time before the minor reaches the age of majority, and thereafter by the child within three years after attaining the age of majority, or—as the lower court ruled—medical malpractice claims must be brought on behalf of a minor within three years of the incident giving rise to the cause of action, or within three years after attaining the age of majority—but at no time in between. The second question presented—which depends on our resolution of the first issue—is whether parents may bring their derivative claims at whatever time the minor’s medical negligence claims are pursued, or whether—as the trial justice concluded—parents must file all derivative claims within three years of the incident giving rise to the cause of action, even if the child’s claims are not brought until sometime thereafter.', 'In light of these important issues, we are satisfied that cause has been shown; the issues presented in the consolidated appeals concerning the hospitals and medical providers shall be assigned to this Court’s regular calendar for full briefing and argument.', 'Therefore, in accordance with Article I, Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, each appellant’s brief shall be due within forty days of the date of this opinion, followed by 8', 'In pertinent part, § 9-1-41 states: “(c) Parents are entitled to recover damages for the loss of their unemancipated minor child’s society and companionship caused by tortious injury to the minor. (d) Actions under this section shall be brought within the time limited under § 9-1-14 or 9-1-14.1, whichever is applicable, for actions for injuries to the person.”', '-7- responsive briefing.', 'We next address whether the claims advanced against defendant corporations Corning and Quest sound in ordinary negligence—and not medical malpractice—and are therefore subject to the statute of limitations contained within § 9-1-19,9 rather than § 9-1-14.1(1). At the July 7, 2011 hearing, the trial justice declared that all plaintiffs’ claims, both direct and derivative, sounded in medical malpractice and therefore all were governed by § 9-1-14.1.10 On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the claims against Corning and Quest do not sound in medical malpractice, but are claims for ordinary negligence, and are therefore subject to the statute of limitations contained in § 9-1-19. In response, defendants Corning and Quest cite Vigue v. John E. Fogarty Memorial Hospital, 481 A.2d 1, 3 (R.I. 1984), for the proposition that plaintiffs’ claims against the laboratories are for medical malpractice and should therefore be subject to the statute of limitations in § 9-1-14.1(1).', 'In Vigue, this Court, when faced with determining whether an alleged tortious act—by a nurse employed by a hospital—constituted ordinary negligence or medical malpractice, turned to the legislative definition of the term medical malpractice.

Accordingly, we are satisfied that the plaintiffs’ claims against Corning and Quest sound in ordinary negligence and are therefore governed by the statute of limitations 11', 'At the time Vigue v.

Fogarty Memorial Hospital, 481 A.2d 1 (R.I. 1984) was decided, the statutory definition of medical malpractice, set forth in G.L. 1956 § 5-37.1-1(f), contained language almost identical to the current definition of medical malpractice in G.L. 1956 § 5-37- 1(8).

After a disc jockey’s performance at a Providence nightclub concluded, the din of the attendees milling about in the street outside the club was punctuated by the sound of gunfire. The shots killed one man and injured another. The defendant, Dana Gallop, was charged with several crimes arising out of the shooting. A jury eventually convicted him of a number of offenses, and he appealed. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he denied a motion to suppress out-of-court and in-court identifications that the defendant argues were unconstitutionally suggestive. He further argues that the trial justice should not have permitted the state to use peremptory challenges that he contends violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the night of December 13, 2008, a disc jockey of some repute with the stage name Kid Capri was performing at Passions, a nightclub in Providence. The audience included many individuals from the Boston, Massachusetts area, such as defendant Dana Gallop and Anthony Parrish, who hailed from different parts of the Dorchester section of Boston. London Hardy, another man from the Boston area, also attended the concert. The concert ended, and the club began to empty around two o’clock in the morning on December 14. After the show, the streets outside the club were teeming with people.', 'Shamair Barboza, a woman who had grown up in Dorchester, was a close friend of Parrish and knew of Gallop. She testified that neighborhood groups with which the two men associated did not get along. As Barboza stood outside Passions, she saw Parrish and his friends walking towards defendant. Barboza said she saw defendant raise his sweatshirt as Parrish approached him, remove a gun from the waistband of his pants, and fire at Parrish. A medical examiner later determined that a bullet entered the middle of Parrish’s back and that the resulting wound caused Parrish’s death.', 'Hardy also attended the Kid Capri show with his girlfriend and several friends. After the show ended, Hardy was standing on the street talking to his girlfriend and her friends as they sat in a stopped car. Hardy later testified that he heard three or four gunshots and then told the women that he had been shot. Once they realized that he was serious, the women assisted him into the car. An officer detailed to the concert checked on Hardy, and paramedics then attended to his injuries. Hardy underwent surgery and recovered. Hardy testified that he did not know who shot him and that he was not acquainted with defendant.', '-2-', 'When the shooting occurred, Nakia Green occupied the driver’s-side rear seat of the car next to which Hardy was standing. Green later testified that she viewed the shooter for five to ten seconds from a distance of eight or ten feet in a well-lit area. Green said that the shooter was a light-skinned black, Hispanic, or Cape Verdean man, about five feet, nine or five feet, ten inches tall, 170 pounds, with braids and a prominent nose. 1', 'Ultimately, a police investigation led to defendant’s arrest and to his being charged with several crimes. Specifically, he was charged with (1) murder, (2) assault with a dangerous weapon, (3) commission of a crime of violence while armed, (4) commission of a crime of violence through the use of a firearm, (5) unlicensed possession of a firearm, and (6) possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence. Prior to trial, the attorney general notified defendant that, if he were convicted, the attorney general would seek an additional sentence under the habitual-offender statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21.', 'The defendant was convicted of all counts except commission of a crime of violence while armed, which the state had dismissed before trial pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice sentenced defendant to two consecutive life sentences, plus a twenty-year sentence to be served consecutively to the second life sentence. The defendant also received two ten-year sentences to run concurrently with the first life sentence. Finally, pursuant to the habitual-offender statute, the trial justice sentenced defendant to an additional twenty years, to be served after the other sentences and to be served without the possibility of parole. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. We will provide additional facts where necessary to expatiate upon the issues before us. 1', 'At trial, the parties stipulated that around the time of the shooting, defendant was six feet tall and weighed 210 pounds.', '-3-', 'II', 'Identifications', 'The defendant argues that the admission of a witness identification was impermissible because the photographic array displayed to the witness was unduly suggestive and because the witness did not have an independently reliable recollection of observing the shooter.', 'After the shooting, Providence police began an investigation that first led Det. Daniel O’Connell to Rhode Island Hospital, where paramedics had brought London Hardy and Anthony Parrish. Although Barboza and some other friends of Parrish were present at the hospital at that time, none of them provided the detective with a statement. At the Providence police station, however, Hardy’s acquaintance Green gave a statement to Det. Michael Fallon.', 'On December 22, Green agreed to view a photographic array. After traveling to Boston, O’Connell provided Green with a form containing photo-lineup instructions, which both she and O’Connell signed. 2 The form instructed a potential eyewitness that the “group of photos may or may not” include a photo of the suspect. Additionally, it informed its reader that “photographs may not always depict the true complexion of a person. It may be lighter or darker than shown in the photo.”', 'Later, at a suppression hearing, both Green and O’Connell described the process by which Green made her selection. O’Connell said that he arranged six photographs in two rows of three and then had Green approach the table on which the photos had been displayed. Green said that she used a “process of elimination” to make her ultimate selection. She said that she eliminated the photos of two “darker-skinned people” first. Green then removed the photos 2', 'The Superior Court file arrived in this Court without the photo array that Green viewed. The file was remanded to locate the missing exhibit. When the exhibit was not located, the parties filed copies of the photographs pursuant to Article I, Rule 10(e) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.', '-4- depicting men whose jawlines did not resemble the shooter. Between the two remaining photos, Green chose a single photo, the back of which she and O’Connell signed. 3 The photo that Green selected depicted defendant. O’Connell testified that, during the photo-array procedure, Green did not exhibit any uncertainty and made her selection in approximately thirty seconds. 4', 'After selecting one of the six photographs in the array, Green walked the detectives to their car. As O’Connell was inserting the photo pack into a file that had been in the police car, the file opened up to a Boston police department booking sheet for defendant. The booking sheet included both a front-view and, notably, a profile photograph of defendant.', 'Green previously had not seen the document, but when she viewed it, she said, “That’s him right there. Why didn’t you show me that picture? That’s a much better picture.” Green elaborated during the hearing on the motion to suppress, explaining that it was a better photo because of the inclusion of a profile photo and because of the fact that it was “not as white-washed.”', 'The hearing also included testimony about the photo array shown to Barboza.', 'On December 16, 2009, O’Connell had an opportunity to speak to Barboza. Barboza had not spoken to police at the hospital on the night of the shooting the prior December, but O’Connell testified that, when he spoke to her in December 2009, Barboza offered remarkable detail of the shooting. She also agreed to view a photo array. 3', 'Green’s and O’Connell’s accounts differ regarding how many photos she initially eliminated. According to O’Connell’s suppression-hearing testimony, Green rejected three photos initially and then another before finally identifying one photo between the remaining two. 4', 'During the suppression hearing, Green testified that, at that time, she did not recognize the shooter in the photographs but that she recalled the photograph that she had previously selected. She also identified defendant as the shooter, although she said that “[she] couldn’t be 90 percent. [She] couldn’t be sure.” The only differences she noted were that defendant was heavier and had a different hairstyle. Green also identified defendant at trial, again noting his hair and weight as the only differences.', '-5-', 'O’Connell gave Barboza the same photo-lineup instruction form and showed her a photographic array. From the photographs that Barboza viewed, she selected one depicting defendant. According to O’Connell, she chose that photo “without hesitation.”', 'Following the suppression hearing, the trial justice determined that the photo arrays shown to Green and Barboza were “exceedingly fair” and that they were “about as fair an example of photo-spreads as [he had] seen in a long, long time.” Although he concluded that the photo arrays were not unnecessarily suggestive, the trial justice also considered whether the witnesses had “independent recollections of the evening in question.” Specifically, the trial justice observed that Green said that she had been only ten feet away from the shooter and that she had a clear, well-illuminated view. He also stated that Green had methodically chosen defendant’s photograph with confidence. For Barboza, the trial justice was persuaded that she had an independent recollection because she had known defendant for years and because the shooter’s face was clearly visible to her at the time in question.', 'Moreover, the trial justice was satisfied that the exposure of defendant’s booking sheet to Green had been accidental. Green’s identification was, according to the trial justice, confident and without hesitation, so the trial justice determined that Green’s chance viewing of the booking sheet was “of no moment.”', 'The trial justice denied the motion to suppress, permitted testimony about the witnesses’ out-of-court identifications, and allowed the witnesses to make in-court identifications. The defendant argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when he denied the motion to suppress Green’s out-of-court and in-court identifications of defendant. 5 5', 'Gallop does not challenge the admissibility of the out-of-court identification by Shamair Barboza, although he says that he disputes the reliability of that identification.', '-6-', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews motions to suppress eyewitness identifications under a clearly erroneous standard.

Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012) (citing Texter, 923 A.2d at 573-74). First, the trial justice must determine “whether the procedure used in the identification was unnecessarily suggestive.” Id. (quoting Texter, 923 A.2d at 574). We have more precisely delineated the bounds of acceptable suggestiveness by saying that an identification procedure must have been “so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification” to be inadmissible. State v. Gatone, 698 A.2d 230, 235 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968)).', 'If, and only if, the photographic array was unnecessarily suggestive is the second step of the analysis implicated. See Brown, 42 A.3d at 1242. Then, the trial justice must “determin[e] ‘whether in the totality of the circumstances the identification was nonetheless reliable.’” Id. at 1242-43 (quoting Texter, 923 A.2d at 574).', 'The factors to be considered in making this determination are', '“[T]he opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time', 'of the crime, the witness’[s] degree of attention, the accuracy of', 'the witness’[s] prior description of the criminal, the level of', 'certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the', '-7-', 'length of time between the crime and the confrontation.” Patel,', '949 A.2d at 411 (quoting State v. Parker, 472 A.2d 1206, 1209', '(R.I. 1984)). If the trial justice concludes that the identification has independent reliability, then it will be admissible notwithstanding the suggestiveness of the procedure employed. See id. at 410, 412; State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1030 (R.I. 2007).', 'For the first step of the analysis, the assessment of a photographic array requires us to “compare the physical characteristics of each individual featured in the display to the general description of the suspect given to the police by the [witness].” Brown, 42 A.3d at 1243 (quoting Gatone, 698 A.2d at 235). “[T]he images constituting a photographic array need not be ‘look- alikes,’ but rather need only possess similar general characteristics.” Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1029 (citing Gatone, 698 A.2d at 236).', 'In this case, defendant contends that the men shown in the photographs in the array did not match the description of the suspect given by Green. Specifically, he argues that none of the photographs depicts an individual with a large nose and only three of the photographs show men who could be described as light-skinned black, Hispanic, or Cape Verdean. We disagree; the photographs in the array portrayed men who “possess[ed] similar general characteristics” to the suspect described by Green. See Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1029.', 'In Gatone, 698 A.2d at 236, we “independently examined” the photographic array and the testimony about its presentation to the witness, and we held that the individuals depicted were the same race described by the witness, “appear[ed] to be similar in age,” and “possess[ed] similar physical characteristics.” Similarly, we affirmed the denial of a motion to suppress an identification in a case in which the witness described the suspect as “dark-skinned” and “black” and the array included a number of photographs that fit that description. Brown, 42 A.3d at', '-8- 1243-44; see also Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1029-30 (upholding the denial of a motion to suppress based on the array containing photos of six white men of similar ages with similar facial hair). Here, we conclude that the individuals depicted in the photographs all have hairstyles, skin tone, and facial features that are sufficiently similar so that they did not create a likelihood of misidentification.', 'The instructions that police provided to Green before she reviewed the photographs further persuade us that the photographic array did not create “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” See Gatone, 698 A.2d at 235 (quoting Simmons, 390 U.S. at 384). Green was informed that “photographs may not always depict the true complexion of a person” and that the “group of photos may or may not” include a picture of the perpetrator of the crime. Those instructions mitigated the risk that Green would choose a photo without realizing that there may have been some level of distortion in the subjects’ complexions or that she might choose a photo simply because she believed she was expected to do so. See Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1029-30 (affirming the denial of a motion to suppress after the trial justice relied, in part, on the “disclaimer document” shown to the witness).', 'We do not agree with defendant’s argument that the manner in which the array was displayed to Green makes it unconstitutionally suggestive. The defendant contends that the simultaneous rather than sequential display of the photographs renders the array unconstitutional. As we noted when we considered a show-up identification and determined that it had been constitutional, “[i]t is important to note that in these situations the main issue before the court is the reliability of the suggestive identification itself, not its relative reliability as compared to a lineup or other less suggestive type of identification.” State v. Turner, 561 A.2d 869, 871 (R.I. 1989) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199-200 & n.6 (1972)). The procedure employed', '-9- here also must be evaluated on its own merit and not in comparison with a proposed or theoretical procedure. Even in State v. Henderson, 27 A.3d 872, 901 (N.J. 2011), on which Gallop heavily relies and in which the New Jersey Supreme Court considered hundreds of scientific studies on memory and eyewitness identification, the court concluded that the science regarding simultaneous versus sequential procedures was inconclusive.', 'The defendant also maintains that O’Connell’s awareness of the identity of the suspect made his administration of the display of the photographs impermissibly suggestive. O’Connell testified that he laid out the photographs while Green was across the room and then had her approach and view them, so we cannot say that his administration of the array created a substantial likelihood of misidentification. 6', 'We hold that the lineup procedure employed in this case was not unnecessarily suggestive. Accordingly, we need not engage in the second step of the analysis, requiring a determination of whether the witness’s independent recollection might permit the admission of her identification even if it had followed an impermissibly suggestive procedure. 7 6', 'Gallop also emphasizes the recommendations contained in the final report of the Rhode Island Task Force to Identify & Recommend Policies & Procedures to Improve the Accuracy of Eyewitness Identifications, which was created pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-1-16. One particular recommendation that defendant cites is the suggestion that the administrator of a photographic array be unaware of the identity of the suspect or conduct the array in a way that prevents the administrator from knowing the position of the suspect’s photograph in the arrangement. First, we note that the final report was issued on December 27, 2010, after the witnesses in this case had made their identifications, the trial justice had denied the motion to suppress, and the jury had convicted defendant. Additionally, while we of course see the benefit of using “best practices” in the administration of photographic arrays, we cannot say that the failure to do so necessarily renders an identification procedure constitutionally deficient. See State v. Turner, 561 A.2d 869, 871 (R.I. 1989) (explaining the need to evaluate each procedure individually and not relatively). 7', 'The defendant also argues that the display of Gallop’s booking sheet to Green confirmed her selection. Although witnesses testified about this incident during the suppression hearing, defendant did not contend in the Superior Court that this “confirmatory feedback” rendered either Green’s selection from the photographic array or later in-court identification of defendant', '- 10 -', 'III', 'Batson Challenges', 'During the jury empanelment, the state used peremptory challenges to two African- American prospective jurors. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he allowed the state to strike these two jurors. 8', 'The first, juror number 148, worked as a part-time legal secretary for a Providence law firm. Although the juror worked for a lawyer who practiced family law, the office’s other attorney is a prominent criminal-defense attorney. The juror also had earned a criminal-justice degree.', 'The state used one of its peremptory challenges to excise this juror from the panel. The trial justice asked whether there was an objection, and defense counsel responded that he had not “heard anything to disqualify her based on her answers.” The trial justice responded by noting that the juror was an African-American woman who “certainly fit[] into the Batson category,” and he asked for the state’s race-neutral reason to challenge her. The prosecutor said that her degree in criminal justice could cause other jurors to “rely on her expertise in an inappropriate inadmissible. Additionally, the trial justice found that the display of defendant’s booking sheet was accidental, which is supported by the record. In our opinion, the accidental display of defendant’s booking sheet did not make Green’s identifications inadmissible. Cf. State v. Gatone, 698 A.2d 230, 237 (R.I. 1997) (“It is well settled that an accidental encounter between a witness and a defendant that is not contrived by the police or the prosecution will not mandate suppression of the witness’s subsequent in-court identification.”). 8', 'Before either juror had been challenged, a different minority juror was excused for cause. At that time, the trial justice informed the parties,', '“I want the record to reflect that this man was an African-', 'American, maybe Liberian—I’m not sure, but certainly a person of', 'color. There are a couple others on the jury as well. If any lawyer', 'intends to excuse, [or] challenge, any minority [member] of this', 'jury, I want to know about it ahead of time in case there’s an', 'objection from the other side. That includes the defense intention', 'to challenge, because the [s]tate can object to that just as much as', 'the defense can object to the [s]tate’s challenge.”', '- 11 - way.” As an additional reason, the state said that the juror’s work as a legal secretary in a law firm that includes a criminal-defense attorney made her “inherently defense-oriented.” Defense counsel offered no further objection to the prosecutor’s proffered reasons. The trial justice considered whether the state offered a “credible, rational reason” and determined that it had. He thus allowed the challenge.', 'The second juror at issue, number 100, was among the first jurors seated in the jury box. It appears from the record that, when her name was initially called, the juror’s response of “here” was not heard by the sheriff, who repeated the judge’s instruction to respond. During voir dire, juror number 100 informed the court that she was unemployed and that she had last worked ten years earlier. When asked how she supported herself, the juror responded that she “live[d] at home with [her] family. Mother and brother.”', 'Juror 100 also was challenged by the state. The prosecutor offered her reasons: the juror had been inattentive and had been unemployed for a significant period of time. The defendant objected but without any elaboration whatsoever. The trial justice said', '“I’m satisfied that this is a clearly [race] neutral reason, and I’m', 'satisfied that it is a rational one, reasonable one. And I credit the', 'excuse offered by the [s]tate and do not find it to be a violation of', 'Batson.” As he had with regard to juror number 148, the trial justice excused juror number 100.', 'Before this Court, Gallop contends that each of these jurors was struck from the panel on the basis of her race, violating Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). Therefore, defendant argues, he was denied equal protection of the law under the United States Constitution.', '- 12 -', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'Because of the nature of the inquiry in a Batson analysis, a trial justice’s decision is “accorded great deference.” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 472 (R.I. 2013) (Pona II) (quoting State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 935 (R.I. 1998)). Thus, the “ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous.” Id. (quoting Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 477 (2008)).', 'B', 'Discussion', '“The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ‘guarantees the defendant that the [s]tate will not exclude members of his [or her] race from the jury venire on account of race[.]’” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting State v. Pona, 926 A.2d 592, 601 (R.I. 2007) (Pona I)). The United States Supreme Court has “delineated a tripartite test for determining whether a criminal defendant has been denied equal protection of the laws by the state’s use of a peremptory challenge.” Pona I, 926 A.2d at 601 (citing Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-98).', 'First, a defendant is required to “establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination[.]” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting Pona I, 926 A.2d at 601). This step of the analysis will become moot if the trial justice moves beyond it to consider the second and third steps. See State v. Austin, 642 A.2d 673, 678 (R.I. 1994) (citing Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 359 (1991) (plurality opinion) (“Once a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question', '- 13 - of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.”)).', 'The second step of a Batson analysis requires “the prosecution to articulate its race- neutral reason(s) for challenging that particular juror.” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935). The reason offered “need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause.” Pona I, 926 A.2d at 602 (quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 97). During the second step, “the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor’s explanation.” Id. (quoting Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 360).', 'The third step of the Batson test requires the trial justice “to determine whether the defendant has carried his or her burden of proving purposeful discrimination.” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935). This determination is the “decisive question”: “whether counsel’s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.” Id. (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935). “[T]he best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.” Id. (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935).', 'Here, defendant contends that the state’s challenges of jurors number 148 and 100 violated Batson. Because the trial justice considered the race-neutral reasons and ultimately ruled on the challenges, the question of whether defendant established a prima facie case is moot. See Pona II, 66 A.3d at 473 (citing Pona I, 926 A.2d at 607). Gallop argues, however, that the prosecutor’s reasons for exercising those challenges were pretextual and hid the true motivation: the prospective jurors’ race.', 'Regarding juror number 148, we have little difficulty concluding that the trial justice’s decision that the challenges were exercised for race-neutral reasons was not clearly erroneous. An attorney’s genuine belief that a juror’s experience might cause him or her to favor the', '- 14 - opposing party would certainly qualify as race neutral. 9 Nothing raised by defendant at trial or apparent from the record leads us to conclude that the reason was pretextual. See Pona II, 66 A.3d at 473 (“The prosecutor’s reason was not facially implausible or unpersuasive so as to compel a finding that it was pretextual.” (citing Austin, 642 A.2d at 678)).', 'The defendant points to juror number 148’s assurances that neither her criminal-justice degree nor her employment in the same office as a criminal-defense attorney would compromise her ability to follow the trial justice’s instructions or be an impartial juror. A juror’s ability to be impartial despite experience that might suggest otherwise is an appropriate concern when contemplating excusing the juror for cause. As we said above, however, a peremptory challenge may be based on a reason that does not rise to the level of a challenge for cause. See Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 362-63 (“While the reason offered by the prosecutor for a peremptory strike need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause, * * * the fact that it corresponds to a valid for-cause challenge will demonstrate its race-neutral character.”). We are therefore of the firm opinion that the challenge to juror number 148 was not unconstitutional.', 'The defendant attacks the excusal of juror number 100 by contending that her alleged inattentiveness is not supported by the record and that other, nonminority jurors also were not employed at the time of voir dire but that they were not challenged. Gallop also contends that unemployment is not a race-neutral reason at all because minorities are more likely to be unemployed. Neither of these arguments, however, was made to the trial justice at the time he was considering the propriety of the peremptory challenge. Rather, the prosecutor said that she would be challenging the juror and immediately offered her race-neutral reasons. Defense counsel, when prompted, said merely, “I object to that, Your Honor.” 9', 'Indeed, defendant subsequently used a peremptory challenge to excuse a prospective juror who had previous law-enforcement experience.', '- 15 -', 'In Pona I, 926 A.2d at 610, we recognized that comparative juror analysis has “practical utility * * * at uncovering pretext,” but we nonetheless declined to consider such an argument that was made for the first time on appeal. “[T]he ultimate burden of persuasion regarding the racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the [peremptory] strike.” Id. at 608-09 n.15 (quoting Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 768 (1995)). Gallop failed to meet this burden because he offered only a general objection to the state’s reasons and he offered nothing as to how the juror had been attentive or how the proffered reasons were equally applicable to nonminority jurors and therefore pretextual. Accordingly, we have no difficulty in holding that the challenge to juror number 100 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.

This case concerns the parameters of the General Assembly’s duty to promote public education, which is set forth in the Education Clause, article 12, section 1 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'Specifically, the plaintiffs challenge the legislatively enacted school funding formula, which, they allege, fails to allocate adequate resources to less affluent communities. These plaintiffs maintain that said formula, together with a confluence of statutory mandates, Rhode Island Department of Education regulations, educational standards, and the low tax capacity of certain urban municipalities, operate to inhibit students in their respective cities from obtaining a quality education.', 'The plaintiffs in this case are the Woonsocket and Pawtucket School Committees and their respective Superintendents, and unnamed students enrolled in Woonsocket and Pawtucket public schools, as well as their unnamed parents (collectively, plaintiffs).', 'These various plaintiffs brought suit against the legislative and executive branches of Rhode Island’s state government, specifically: the Governor, the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of', '-1- Representatives, the General Assembly, and the State Treasurer (collectively, defendants).

The plaintiffs assert that each city and town in Rhode Island contained at least one public school by the end of the eighteenth century and that the General Assembly began legislating in this arena in 1828.', 'The plaintiffs note that Rhode Island’s Constitution of 1842 2 included an education clause, article 12, section 1, which read as follows:', '“The diffusion of knowledge, as well as of virtue among the', 'people, being essential to the preservation of their rights and', 'liberties, it shall be the duty of the general assembly to promote', 'public schools, and to adopt all means which they may deem', 'necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and', 'opportunities of education.” 1', 'As we rest our opinion upon the Education Clause, we shall not address plaintiffs’ compliance with Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, commanding that a pleading contain “a short and plain statement of the claim.” 2', 'The 1842 Constitution replaced the Royal Charter of 1663, granted by Charles II, as the state’s organic law.

We shall refer to it as the 1842 Constitution.', '-2- The plaintiffs assert that “[i]n the decades that followed [the 1842 Constitution] the General Assembly established, as a matter of state law, that public schools would be available to all at no charge.” The General Assembly enacted compulsory school attendance laws beginning in 1893, with various additions and changes to these laws continuing through 2007. The complaint outlines the creation of the State Board of Education in 1870, the subsequent regulation of teachers, and the creation of high schools.', 'The plaintiffs allege that “[i]n 1960, the General Assembly sought to systematically define all of the elements of an appropriate education” and passed laws that required school districts to ensure a sufficient budget to support this basic educational program. The General Assembly delegated to the Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education (Board of Regents) the responsibility of defining the mandated minimum program, and the Board of Regents in turn directed the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) to prepare a Basic Education Program Manual (BEP Manual) in the 1980s. The BEP Manual set forth a basic educational program that was to be available to each student, regardless of where in the state the student attended school.', 'The plaintiffs next address how the General Assembly has “codified a series of minimum mandatory performance standards in core subjects that each child in Rhode Island must attain.” Pursuant to 1997 legislation (P.L. 1997, ch. 30, Art. 31, codified at G.L. 1956 chapter 7.1 of title 16) referred to as “Article 31,” the General Assembly directed the Board of Regents to develop an assessment program in order to measure students’ educational progress against a standard of “proficiency.” In 2001, the federal “No Child Left Behind Act” also required states to develop plans that incorporated challenging academic standards into the content of each student’s education. In response to Article 31 and the No Child Left Behind Act, the Board of Regents', '-3- created grade-level standards for all Rhode Island students in the core subjects of reading, written and oral communication, mathematics, science, and civics. Between 2003 and 2008, the Board of Regents enacted “literacy regulations,” which included high-school graduation requirements, statewide curricula, English-language-learner regulations, and regulations aimed at reducing high-school dropout rates.', 'Rhode Island also adopted the New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP), which is a yearly standardized test that assesses all students in reading, mathematics, and writing, with selected grades assessed in science.', 'The NECAP tests measure children’s content knowledge against RIDE’s standards for what each student should know according to his or her grade level. NECAP scores are classified into four levels: proficient with distinction, proficient, partially proficient, and substantially below proficient.', 'In 2009, the Board of Regents promulgated revisions to the BEP Manual, requiring school districts to “provide a comprehensive program of study in English language arts, mathematics, social studies, the sciences, visual arts & design and the performing arts, engineering and technology, comprehensive health, and world language throughout the PK-12 system.” In January 2011, RIDE promulgated a draft set of proposed revisions to its 2008 high- school regulations, which articulated specific high-school graduation requirements.', 'These requirements provided in part that, beginning with the class of 2012, students would be required to achieve NECAP scores of “partially proficient” in order to earn a diploma. After teachers and students expressed concern that the diploma requirements would harm the future of children unable to attain a sufficiently high score on the NECAP assessments, the Board of Regents approved a revised regulation that postponed the NECAP assessment graduation requirement until the class of 2014.', '-4-', 'In the next section of their complaint, plaintiffs address the lack of parity between educational standards and funding. The plaintiffs express support for the policies of RIDE and the Board of Regents aimed at “enact[ing] minimum education program standards for all of Rhode Island’s children”; plaintiffs’ claim for judicial relief centers on “the General Assembly’s failure to allocate adequate resources to permit the realization of those standards.” The plaintiffs assert that, beginning in 1991, the General Assembly’s funding policy has “lack[ed] a rational relationship to community need, and ha[s] increased the burdens on urban communities to an unsustainable level, depriving them of the resources needed to educate their children to the minimum level mandated by the State.”', 'The plaintiffs begin this portion of the complaint with a discussion of the “1960 funding formula,” which provided for school districts to set their own budgets, with the state paying a proportion (the “share ratio”) of these budgets based on each district’s relative property-tax wealth per student. This funding formula was titled the “operations aid” program. The formula was amended in 1967 and 1988 to increase the state’s share of funding; in 1991, however, the state failed to provide full funding for the operations aid program and imposed a reduction of $26.3 million pro rata among the districts. 3 The plaintiffs assert that the operations aid funding from 1997 through 2005 “was not proportionate to a district’s student population, relative wealth, or any measurable criterion” and that, “[b]y 2004-5, the state share for education remained at 43%, one of the seven lowest in the country.”', 'In 1995, the General Assembly enacted the “Caruolo Act” (P.L. 1995, ch. 173, § 1), codified at G.L. 1956 § 16-2-21.4, which “created a remedy in Superior Court for school districts 3', 'In response to this reduction, the municipalities of Pawtucket, Woonsocket, and West Warwick brought suit against the state, seeking to remedy disparities in the school funding system. The plaintiffs in that case prevailed in the Superior Court, but the judgment was reversed on appeal. See City of Pawtucket v. Sundlun, 662 A.2d 40 (R.I. 1995), discussed infra.', '-5- to sue municipal governments when the schools lacked adequate resources to provide the minimum education required under the [BEP Manual].” The plaintiffs allege, however, that the Caruolo Act could not achieve its purported goal of vindicating children’s rights to adequately funded education because communities such as Woonsocket and Pawtucket “simply lack[] the capacity to raise sufficient local funds to provide a quality education program for [their] children.”', 'In 2006, the General Assembly enacted the “Paiva-Weed Act” (P.L. 2006, ch. 253, § 5), amending § 16-2-21, which “placed limits on annual increases in municipal taxes.”', 'The plaintiffs assert that the Paiva-Weed Act placed an initial cap of 5.5 percent on municipal taxes in 2006, with a scheduled cap of 4 percent in 2012-2013. The plaintiffs allege that, pursuant to the Paiva-Weed Act, “school departments are forbidden even to request from their municipalities any local contributions in the excess of a specified percentage increase.” Further, “[t]he Paiva- Weed Act required courts to ‘consider the percentage caps on school district budgets * * * ’ when issuing a decree granting relief under the Caruolo Act.”', 'The General Assembly enacted a new educational funding formula in 2010, which, according to plaintiffs, “fails to provide adequate resources to allow children, especially in poor, urban communities, to obtain a quality education that provides a reasonable opportunity for each child to meet the academic standards established by RIDE.” The 2010 funding formula allocates costs between the local communities and the state based on a mathematical ratio that considers each community’s relative share of property value per pupil and median family income. The plaintiffs assert that the 2010 formula harms communities with weak property-tax bases, such as Pawtucket and Woonsocket. Furthermore, the General Assembly chose to implement the 2010 funding formula over a period of years, meaning that “it will be a long time before underfunded', '-6- communities, including Pawtucket and Woonsocket, receive State aid that is adequate even under the General Assembly’s flawed methodology.”', 'The plaintiffs devote the next portion of their complaint to a description of the educational consequences of the General Assembly’s inadequate funding formulas. They assert that “[a]s a result of the General Assembly’s commendable action to establish minimum standards, the Woonsocket and Pawtucket school committees are faced with increasing funding requirements,” and yet they “lack the resources to meet these standards.” Specifically, plaintiffs assert that the 2008-2009 NECAP scores for Woonsocket’s and Pawtucket’s elementary, middle, and high-school students were woefully below state averages and showed extremely low levels of proficiency in reading, writing, mathematics, and science. The NECAP scores also showed an achievement gap between white and nonwhite students, and the schools were unable to comply with the Board of Regents’ regulations governing educational programs for students learning English as a second language.', 'The state has classified some of these schools as making “insufficient progress” for failing to meet academic targets in core subject areas.', 'The plaintiffs assert that all schools in Woonsocket and Pawtucket are mandated pursuant to state regulations to provide additional support for students whose reading and mathematics proficiency is below grade level; however, the schools lack the funding necessary to comply with these mandates. The schools also suffer from inferior facilities and a lack of adequate materials. For example, plaintiffs assert that Pawtucket’s Shea High School has unmanageable climate control, mold problems, leaks, broken windows, and science labs lacking running water or gas. While the school enrolls children from fifty different countries who speak twenty-five different languages, it has only one translator. The school’s social studies textbooks end with the Clinton presidency, and the school runs out of paper part way through the academic year. The plaintiffs', '-7- assert that if the Board of Regents’ regulations come into effect, imposing NECAP scores of partially proficient as a graduation requirement, 64 percent of Shea High School’s students will not qualify for a diploma.', 'The plaintiffs assert that “[t]he lack of educational opportunities available to children in Rhode Island’s urban communities, including Woonsocket and Pawtucket, contribute significantly to the State’s position of having some of the lowest performing public schools in the country.”', 'Count 1 of plaintiffs’ complaint alleges a violation of the Education Clause, article 12, section 1 of the Rhode Island Constitution. The plaintiffs assert that the General Assembly has “enacted minimum academic standards that apply to all children in Rhode Island” pursuant to its constitutional duty to promote public schools. According to plaintiffs, “the General Assembly has repeatedly failed to provide adequate resources to implement those standards, even while recognizing this inadequacy and articulating many viable solutions.” The plaintiffs assert that the Paiva-Weed Act “prevent[s] municipal governments from providing sufficient local resources” and limits the Caruolo Act in such a way that “compromise[s] the ability of school districts to ensure a proper allocation of local resources to educate children, especially in a time of inadequate State resources.”', 'Count 2 sets forth the language of article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution 4 and alleges that “[p]laintiffs have a substantive due process right to public education,” which has 4', 'Article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides:', '“Laws for good of whole — Burdens to be equally distributed —', 'Due process — Equal protection — Discrimination — No right to', 'abortion granted. — All free governments are instituted for the', 'protection, safety, and happiness of the people.

No person', '-8- “been denied * * * due to the General Assembly’s failure to provide adequate school aid.” This count also sets forth the language of article 1, section 5 of the Rhode Island Constitution. 5 Although count 2 is titled “Substantive Due Process,” the hearing justice found that plaintiffs were “also alleging violations of equal protection,” because article 1, section 2 refers to both due process and equal protection, and because plaintiffs’ prayer for relief states a deprivation of the right to equal treatment under the law.', 'Count 3 of plaintiffs’ complaint was withdrawn by agreement of the parties. Count 4 asserts a claim for injunctive relief, and count 5 presents a general assertion that the 2010 funding formula is inadequate to meet the needs of the children of Woonsocket and Pawtucket. Count 5 also asserts that allocations of state aid to Pawtucket and Woonsocket in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 are inadequate according to the definition of adequacy contained in the 2010 funding formula. 6', 'In their prayer for relief, plaintiffs seek: (1) a declaration that the student plaintiffs have a right to receive an adequate education pursuant to article 12 and the Rhode Island General Laws;', 'shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of', 'law, nor shall any person be denied equal protection of the laws.', 'No otherwise qualified person shall, solely by reason of race,', 'gender or handicap be subject to discrimination by the state, its', 'agents or any person or entity doing business with the state.', 'Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant or secure any', 'right relating to abortion or the funding thereof.” 5', 'Article 1, section 5 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides:', '“Entitlement to remedies for injuries and wrongs — Right to', 'justice. — Every person within this state ought to find a certain', 'remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs', 'which may be received in one’s person, property, or character.', 'Every person ought to obtain right and justice freely, and without', 'purchase, completely and without denial; promptly and without', 'delay; conformably to the laws.” 6', 'The hearing justice analyzed counts 1 and 5 as one claim, because they both implicate the General Assembly’s authority to regulate public education financing.', '-9- (2) a finding that the present system of education financing deprives plaintiffs of their right to an adequate education; (3) a finding that the present system of education financing systematically deprives plaintiffs of their right to equal treatment under the law in violation of article 1, section 2; (4) a finding that the Paiva-Weed Act places unconstitutional restrictions on the ability of communities to raise local taxes for public education; (5) a declaration that the 2010-2011 through 2016-2017 allocations of aid to Pawtucket and Woonsocket are inadequate according to the 2010 funding formula; (6) an injunction against further constitutional violations; (7) an injunction directing defendants to devise and implement a funding program that complies with constitutional standards; and (8) attorneys’ fees and costs.', 'The defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) 7 and 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, defendants argued that this Court’s decision in City of Pawtucket v. Sundlun, 662 A.2d 40 (R.I. 1995), bars relitigation of the constitutionality of the General Assembly’s decisions regarding school funding, and that the issue presented is a nonjusticiable political question—the consideration of which would constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. 8 Hearings were held on April 24, 2012 and June 19, 2012, and the hearing justice issued a thirty-one-page decision granting defendants’ motion on July 12, 2012.

The hearing justice did not reach these issues in her decision. Because we now find that plaintiffs’ complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we too need not address these issues.

Sundlun', 'In Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 42, we had the opportunity to review and interpret article 12, section 1, in order to determine “the means by which the General Assembly fulfills its constitutional mandate to provide public education * * * .” Sundlun was a case initiated by students, taxpayers, and government representatives from three Rhode Island communities, including Pawtucket and Woonsocket, who objected to the state’s 1991 appropriation for', '- 12 - elementary and secondary education. Id. The plaintiffs asserted that “the state’s method of funding public education was violative of the Rhode Island Constitution”; they asked the court to direct defendants, who included the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, “to devise, enact, and implement a system of aid to education that would fairly levy the taxes necessary to provide equal educational opportunities to students and that would assign educational resources as uniformly as was practical.” Id. at 43. The case was tried in Superior Court, and the trial justice issued a judgment declaring that the school finance system violated the Education Clause as well as the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Rhode Island Constitution. Id. at 43.', 'We reversed that decision on appeal, rejecting the Superior Court’s finding that the Education Clause provides a “fundamental and constitutional right for each child to * * * an opportunity to receive an equal, adequate, and meaningful education.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 55, 63. We perceived that the trial justice’s interpretation of the Education Clause “contradict[ed] the historical record and the express language of article 12” and “fail[ed] to recognize the role of the Judiciary in our tripartite system of government.” Id. at 55.', 'In explaining our decision in Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 45-49, we set forth a detailed historical context for article 12, section 1. After reviewing the statutory and constitutional development of public education in Rhode Island, we concluded that, “given the context of the times in which it was adopted, article 12, section 1, does not appear to have imposed on the General Assembly any new, measurable, or judicially enforceable duties to support education beyond those then extant.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 49. The duties that existed with regard to public education when the Constitution was ratified in 1842 were slim—the state began to provide funding for public schools in 1828, but this merely supplemented local contributions, the', '- 13 - amounts of which were determined by each community. Id. at 46. It was not until 1882, forty years after the adoption of the Constitution, that the General Assembly created a state system of education by mandating that every town establish a public school. Id. at 48. As we noted in Sundlun, “[t]o suggest that the 1842 Constitution imposed upon the General Assembly a duty to compensate for a town’s inability to raise local taxes is wholly unreasonable, given that towns were not required to fund such endeavors at all.” Id. at 49.', 'The portion of the Education Clause concerning education was not substantively revised during the constitutional convention of 1986, despite numerous efforts to amend the language in order to provide what was thought to be a more equitable school funding system. Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 49. We noted in Sundlun:', '“The convention’s adoption of article 12, section 1,', 'signifies that the framers of the 1986 Constitution did not intend to', 'alter the state’s approach to funding education or to impose new', 'constitutional requirements upon the General Assembly in respect', 'to education. * * * The framers * * * had the opportunity to', 'radically alter the nature of the state’s role in public education.', 'They chose not to do so.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 50.', 'Thus, in Sundlun we addressed the issue of whether the General Assembly is constitutionally obligated to establish a system of public schools that provides the opportunity for an equitable, adequate education for all children in the state. After expounding on the history of the constitutional treatment of public education, we determined that the General Assembly is not constitutionally required to provide for such a system. Having made this determination, however, we were left to define the substantive rights, if any, created by the language of article 12, section 1.', 'After examining the meaning of the word “promote” in its historical and contemporary contexts, we concluded:', '“[T]he word ‘promote’ in article 12, section 1, does not mean', '‘found’ or ‘establish.’ The meaning of the word in its historical', '- 14 -', 'context clearly precludes such a definition, first, because the towns', 'themselves ‘founded’ or ‘established’ their public schools, not the', 'General Assembly, and, second, because the State Constitution of', '1842 did not require the founding or establishing of a public school', 'in every town. The historical evidence demonstrates that since the', 'time article 12 was adopted, the establishment of schools has been', 'left to the local communities although financial and other', 'assistance were provided by the state.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 56.', 'We then went on to discuss the remaining language of article 12, section 1, which states that it shall be the duty of the General Assembly “to adopt all means which it may deem necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of education * * * .” We determined that this portion of the Education Clause vested the General Assembly with plenary power in the realm of public education: “We concur with plaintiffs that the right to an education is a constitutional right in this state, but we stress that article 12 assigns to the General Assembly the responsibility for that right.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 57.', '2. Repeal of the Continuing Powers Clause', 'We also cited in Sundlun to the now-repealed article 6, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution—the so-called “Continuing Powers Clause,” which read as follows: “The general assembly shall continue to exercise the powers it has heretofore exercised, unless prohibited in this Constitution.” See Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 50. We stated:', '“Among the powers the General Assembly had exercised prior to', 'the adoption of the 1986 Constitution was the power to promote', 'public education through a statutory funding scheme and through', 'reliance on local property taxation. The ratification of article 6,', 'section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution of 1986 represented a', 'knowing and an express endorsement of the Legislature’s primacy', 'over education. * * * It is thus clear that the General Assembly’s', 'plenary and exclusive power over public education in Rhode Island', 'has not changed since the adoption of the State Constitution in', '1842.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 50.', '- 15 -', 'The plaintiffs’ main contention on appeal is that, because the Rhode Island electorate has since repealed article 6, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, this Court now has “the Constitutional responsibility to review legislative action more closely” than we did when we decided Sundlun. The plaintiffs argue that “Sundlun followed more than a century of precedents that interpreted the ‘continuing powers’ clause to support Rhode Island’s constitutional doctrine of legislative supremacy” and that “[t]he Sundlun [c]ourt relied upon the ‘continuing powers’ clause in establishing a highly deferential standard of judicial review.” The defendants disagree, arguing that the repeal of article 6, section 10 did not affect article 12, section 1, which grants plenary power over education to the General Assembly.', 'The plaintiffs are correct in their assertion that our state government has undergone significant changes since we decided Sundlun. In 2004, Rhode Island’s electorate approved four amendments to the state constitution, commonly referred to as the “separation of powers amendments.”', 'These amendments clearly established, for the first time in Rhode Island’s history, three separate and distinct departments of government.', 'One of these amendments consisted of repealing the Continuing Powers Clause, article 6, section 10.', 'We addressed the implications of the separation of powers amendments in In re Request for Advisory Opinion from the House of Representatives (Coastal Resources Management Council), 961 A.2d 930 (R.I. 2008) (hereinafter “CRMC”). That request for an advisory opinion required us to review, in light of the separation of powers amendments, legislation that permitted members of the General Assembly to sit as members of the Coastal Resources Management Council.

We disagree. We did note in Sundlun that, prior to the adoption of the 1986 Constitution, the General Assembly exercised “the power to promote public education through a statutory funding scheme and through reliance on local property taxation,” and we stated that the Continuing Powers Clause “represented a knowing and an express endorsement of the Legislature’s primacy over education.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 50. We cannot say, however, that our decision in Sundlun depended on this language. The bulk of our written opinion consisted of an historical analysis of Rhode Island’s public', '- 17 - education system, the General Assembly’s related legislative acts, and an examination of the language of article 12, section 1, within its historical context. See id. at 45-57.', 'Furthermore, as we noted in CRMC, “the separation of powers amendments did not * * * limit or abolish the power of the General Assembly in any other area where we have previously found its jurisdiction to be plenary.[]” CRMC, 961 A.2d at 935-36. Plenary power means that “all * * * determinations [are left] to the General Assembly’s broad discretion to adopt the means it deems ‘necessary and proper’ in complying with the constitutional directive.” Id. at 938 (quoting Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 56).', 'Our prior case law reveals that the Education Clause has always been interpreted in a manner that grants the General Assembly broad discretion in carrying out its constitutional duty to promote public education in Rhode Island, and this interpretation has not been based on the Continuing Powers Clause. See, e.g., Brown v. Elston, 445 A.2d 279, 285 (R.I. 1982) (reaffirming that article 12 “vests the State Legislature with sole responsibility in the field of education”); Coventry School Committee v. Richtarik, 122 R.I. 707, 712, 411 A.2d 912, 914 (1980) (reiterating that public education is the responsibility of the General Assembly, and that school committees act as agents of the state when discharging their responsibilities); Members of Jamestown School Committee v.

Applying Sundlun and CRMC to Plaintiffs’ Education Clause Claim', 'It is appropriate at this juncture to note that, “[u]nder the doctrine of stare decisis, ‘courts should adopt the reasoning of earlier judicial decisions if the same points arise again in litigation.’” State v.

We have previously stated that “this Court always makes a concerted effort to adhere to existing legal precedent.” Pastore v. Samson, 900 A.2d 1067, 1077 (R.I. 2006). We will, however, bear in mind that “stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” State v. Musumeci, 717 A.2d 56, 64-65 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119 (1940)). We also recognize that, as an advisory opinion, CRMC has no precedential value. See Irons v. Rhode Island Ethics Commission, 973 A.2d 1124, 1132 n.15 (R.I. 2009). Moreover, our statement therein concerning the General Assembly’s plenary authority with respect to its duties in the domain of education is clearly dictum. Nevertheless, we find it to be highly persuasive, and, now that we are confronted with the Education Clause directly, we find it to be an accurate statement of constitutional law.', 'The hearing justice applied Sundlun and CRMC to the facts alleged in the instant case and found that these prior decisions warranted dismissal of plaintiffs’ Education Clause claim. We concur with the hearing justice’s findings in this regard. The plaintiffs object to the General Assembly’s system for regulating and funding public education, claiming that the state has', '- 19 - harmed children by “replacing local control with State-level mandates” while imposing a funding system that prevents municipalities from attaining the resources necessary to meet the requirements. In our opinion, the factual allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint make a strong case to suggest that the current funding system is not beneficial to students in Pawtucket and Woonsocket, especially when compared to other municipalities. We are sensitive to plaintiffs’ concerns, and yet our prior case law clearly declares that the General Assembly has exclusive authority to regulate the allocation of resources for public education.', 'This is not to say, however, that there could not be a situation in which the General Assembly violates its “constitutional mandate to support and promote education so as to warrant a judicial response.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 57. We agree with our prior holding in Sundlun that the Rhode Island Constitution imposes an affirmative duty upon the General Assembly to promote public schools. It is not our function, however, to explore hypothetical scenarios beyond the facts that are currently before us on review.', 'B', 'Separation of Powers', 'The hearing justice also based her decision to dismiss plaintiffs’ Education Clause claim on the separation of powers doctrine. This doctrine is set forth in article 5 of the Rhode Island Constitution, which states: “The powers of the government shall be distributed into three separate and distinct departments: the legislative, executive and judicial.” We have previously held that “[t]he separation of powers doctrine prohibits the usurpation of the power of one branch of government by a coordinate branch of government.” Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565, 579 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Town of East Greenwich v. O’Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 107 (R.I. 1992)). “Functionally, the doctrine may be violated in two ways.', 'One branch may interfere', '- 20 - impermissibly with the other’s performance of its constitutionally assigned function. * * * Alternatively, the doctrine may be violated when one branch assumes a function that more properly is entrusted to another.” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 58 (quoting I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 963 (1983) (Powell, J., concurring)).', 'In Sundlun, we concluded that the plaintiffs’ legal and factual claims had urged a violation of the separation of powers in two respects: they asked us to “interfere with the plenary constitutional power of the General Assembly in education”; and they “urg[ed] that we order ‘equity’ in [educational] funding sufficient to ‘achieve learner outcomes.’” Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 58. The plaintiffs in that case had specifically asked the court to “devise, enact, and implement a system of aid to education that would fairly levy the taxes necessary to provide equal educational opportunities to students and that would assign educational resources as uniformly as was practical.” Id. at 43. We were deeply troubled by the trial justice’s resolution of the plaintiffs’ claims, which consisted of adopting a judicially unmanageable standard—“the right to receive an ‘equal, adequate, and meaningful education.’” Id. at 58.', 'Here, plaintiffs have focused their argument on the “duty to promote” portion of the Education Clause, and they have framed their appeal “in terms of whether this Court has any role whatever in reviewing the General Assembly’s duty to promote public schools under [article 12, section 1].” Instead of asking us to formulate a new system of educational funding, plaintiffs have asked us to declare that the legal framework established by the General Assembly for regulating and funding public education creates unattainable mandates and, therefore, fails to “promote” public schools. Functionally, however, these two claims represent a request for the same impermissible goal: imposing our own judgment over that of the Legislature in order to determine whether a particular policy benefits public education. We decline to interfere with the', '- 21 - General Assembly’s prerogative to fashion the policies that it, as a collective representative of the people, deems most appropriate for the establishment and maintenance of the state’s public schools. 9', 'We emphasize that we are deeply concerned by the conditions of the schools in Pawtucket and Woonsocket as alleged by plaintiffs, as well as by the alleged predicaments of those municipalities regarding their inabilities to allocate the funding required to meet state mandates. Installing a means of providing adequate educational opportunities to every child in the state is not only an admirable goal; it is “perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.” San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 29 (1973) (quoting Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954)).', 'An educated populace is an essential element of our system of government, necessary for the continued protection of our rights and liberties. The framers of our constitution clearly reflected these ideas when they drafted article 12, section 1. We, however, are not the branch of government that the framers charged with implementing a system of education. The plaintiffs’ complaint is more appropriately addressed to the General Assembly, which has been charged with both the power and the duty to address their concerns. 10 9', 'Indeed, the arena of education policy presents many difficult dilemmas that are not easily resolved. Reasonable minds could reach many different conclusions regarding how best to accomplish the goal of educating our state’s children. For example, South Korea and Finland are known to produce some of the best educational outcomes in the world; they accomplish these outcomes, however, through two entirely different educational frameworks. See Best Education In the World: Finland, South Korea Top Country Rankings, U.S. Rated Average, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/best-education-in-the- wor_n_2199795.html?view=print&comm_ref=false (last visited March 4, 2014). We, the unelected judiciary, are not suited to make these difficult policy decisions for the people of Rhode Island. 10', 'The plaintiffs and defendants also raised the issue of whether this case presents a nonjusticiable political question. Because we have decided the matter on the grounds of our', '- 22 -', 'C', 'Substantive Due Process', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the 2010 funding formula violates substantive due process because it “is an arbitrary and capricious political solution” that impairs plaintiffs’ “fundamental right to adequately funded education in the basic core subjects.” Substantive due process is found in article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution, which provides in pertinent part: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied equal protection of the laws.”', 'The first inquiry in a substantive due process analysis is whether the challenged government action affects a fundamental right. Riley, 941 A.2d at 205-06. We have previously held that the Rhode Island Constitution does not provide a fundamental right to education, and we do not presently perceive any reason to question this holding. See Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 55. We have also held, however, that “[t]he substantive component of due process ‘guards against arbitrary and capricious government action.’” East Bay Community Development Corp. v. Zoning Board of Review of Barrington, 901 A.2d 1136, 1150 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Brunelle v. Town of South Kingstown, 700 A.2d 1075, 1084 (R.I. 1997)). Thus, when no fundamental right is at issue, a party seeking to establish a substantive due process violation must show that the challenged statute or action is “clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.” Id. (quoting Cherenzia v. Lynch, 847 A.2d 818, 826 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Here, count 2 of the plaintiffs’ complaint appears only to assert a claim that the General Assembly’s failure to provide adequate funding has impaired their perceived right to an previous precedent and the separation of powers doctrine, we decline to address the political question issue.', '- 23 - education. On appeal, however, the plaintiffs focus their due process argument on the alleged arbitrariness and capriciousness of the 2010 funding formula. The hearing justice addressed both of these potential substantive due process claims and found the plaintiffs’ complaint insufficient to establish either one. We agree with the hearing justice’s conclusions in this regard. Although the plaintiffs spare no ink in outlining the alleged inadequacies of the 2010 funding formula, they do not present facts to suggest that this legislative enactment is devoid of any “substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.” See East Bay Community Development Corp., 901 A.2d at 1150 (quoting Cherenzia, 847 A.2d at 826).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Sandra Carney, appeals an order of the Family Court in favor of the plaintiff, her former husband, Stephen Carney, Jr. 1 On February 26, 2014, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record as well as the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the Family Court, and we remand the case to that tribunal for further findings of fact. 1', 'We refer to the parties by their first names for clarity and convenience to the reader. No disrespect is intended.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 22, 2006, a justice of the Family Court entered final judgment on the divorce between Stephen and Sandra Carney, ending a marriage of nearly seventeen years. When final judgment entered, the couple were the parents of two boys, aged four and eight. The parties had entered into a marriage settlement agreement (MSA), which the Family Court had approved and incorporated by reference, but not merged, into the final judgment.', 'A dispute over the interpretation of a particular paragraph of this agreement has led the parties to this Court.', 'At the time of divorce, the parties were joint owners of their home at 12 Starbrook Drive in Barrington. Under the terms of the MSA, Stephen agreed to convey his interest in the marital domicile to Sandra via quitclaim deed. In return, Sandra agreed that she would be responsible for all costs associated with the house; she also agreed to refinance the property so that Stephen would be released from any obligation on the promissory note financing the property and the mortgage securing the note. Particular to the issues confronting us in this appeal, paragraph seven of the MSA contained the following provision:', '“Further still it is agreed that the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff', 'as equitable distribution the sum of $100,000.00 at the end of', 'calendar year 2024. Provided however, in the event that the', 'defendant/wife shall cohabit for more than sixty (60) consecutive', 'days with a member of the opposite sex or, in the event she', 'remarries she shall have the obligation to pay to the', 'plaintiff/husband the aforementioned sum of $100,000.00 at that', 'time.

In his motion, Stephen argued that Sandra had failed to comply with the MSA because she did not pay the equitable distribution to him upon the sale of the former marital domicile. Sandra then filed her own motion, in which she alleged that, in violation of the MSA, Stephen had failed to pay alimony, contribute to the college education funds for their two children, and cover expenses for child care and camp.', 'After conducting a hearing, a justice of the Family Court issued an order on February 10, 2012, that disposed of several points of contention between the parties and outlined the remaining issues, including those before us on appeal, for which the court needed either further documentation or hearing. On May 30, 2012, the trial justice heard arguments on those issues. After concluding that the parties would not be able to resolve their differences by agreement, the trial justice interpreted paragraph seven of the MSA to mean that when the agreement was executed, it was the intent of the parties that Sandra and the two children would remain in the marital domicile and that the property would not be sold during the minority of the children. 2', 'Notably, the couple’s youngest son will attain the age of twenty-two in the year 2024. 3', 'Stephen employed several procedural maneuvers to prevent the sale of the former marital domicile, all of which proved to be unsuccessful.', '-3-', 'The trial justice then focused on the two triggering events that would provide for immediate payment to Stephen, namely, if Sandra were to remarry or cohabit. The trial justice also determined that the third provision of paragraph seven, which laid out a formula for payment to Stephen in the event of the sale of the property, functioned as another triggering event that would entitle Stephen to payment immediately. The trial justice reasoned that the parties intended immediate equitable distribution in the event of a sale occurring before 2024 because it would have been illogical for them to assume that the value of the property would be only $475,000 in 2024 “[g]iven what we know about real estate[.]” Next, the trial justice applied the formula and concluded that the amount Sandra was to pay Stephen was one-half of the difference between the sale price of $356,250 and $475,000, which would result in a payment to Stephen of $59,375. The trial justice gave Sandra until September 2012 to produce that amount. Finally, the trial justice concluded during the hearing that the responsibility for paying for the children’s “enrichment activities” would be divided evenly between the parties. The trial justice issued an order memorializing her findings on October 2, 2012. Sandra timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A marriage settlement agreement “that is not merged into a divorce judgment retains the characteristics of a contract.” Riffenburg v. Riffenburg, 585 A.2d 627, 630 (R.I. 1991). “The existence of ambiguity in a contract is a question of law.” Paul v. Paul, 986 A.2d 989, 993 (R.I. 2010) (citing Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 558 (R.I. 2009)). “[T]he holding of a trial court (including the Family Court) about the existence or nonexistence of ambiguity in the terms of the contract is freely reviewable by this Court.” Id.', '-4- (quoting Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 738 n.8 (R.I. 2005)). Therefore, the trial justice’s conclusions on questions of law are reviewed de novo. Beacon Mutual Insurance Co. v.

Conversely, we afford deference to the trial justice’s findings of fact and will disturb them only if she “misconceived the relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Horton v.

First, she contends that the trial justice erred when she determined that Sandra was required to pay Stephen when the property was sold, and not in 2024. Second, Sandra maintains that the trial justice erred in calculating the amount of money she owes to Stephen from the sale of the property. Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice improperly modified the terms of the MSA when she ordered the parties to equally share in the costs of extracurricular and child-enrichment activity expenses.', 'A', 'Is the MSA ambiguous?', 'Before this Court, Sandra argues that the trial justice misconstrued the language of the MSA when she found paragraph seven to be ambiguous and when she ordered Sandra to pay Stephen upon the sale of the property.', 'Although the trial justice did not use the term “ambiguous” in her ruling, her analysis of the parties’ intent can lead to no other conclusion. To the contrary, Sandra maintains that the language of paragraph seven states clearly and', '-5- unambiguously that the equitable-distribution payment owed to Stephen is not to be disbursed until 2024 unless either of the two triggering events occurs before then. Sandra supports this contention by indicating that paragraph seven encompasses but two events that would accelerate payment to Stephen prior to 2024, neither of which involves the sale of the property. Therefore, Sandra reasons, she may sell the property whenever she wishes and, unless she remarries or cohabits, is free from paying Stephen the equitable distribution set forth in the MSA until “the end of calendar year 2024.”', 'Conversely, Stephen argues that the language in the MSA about the timing of the payment of the equitable distribution is ambiguous.', 'He maintains that because the MSA provides for acceleration of the payment in two circumstances that are economically beneficial to Sandra (cohabitation or remarriage), sale of the property also would provide an economic benefit, and it therefore should be construed as a third triggering event.', '“A reviewing court has no need to construe contractual provisions unless those terms are ambiguous.” A.F. Lusi Construction, Inc. v. Peerless Insurance Co., 847 A.2d 254, 258 (R.I. 2004). We have consistently held that a contract provision is ambiguous if it is “reasonably susceptible of different constructions.”', 'Paul, 986 A.2d at 993 (quoting Andrukiewicz v. Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d 235, 238 (R.I. 2004)). We determine ambiguity by “view[ing] the agreement in its entirety and giv[ing] to its language its ‘plain, ordinary and usual meaning.’” Vickers Antone v. Vickers, 610 A.2d 120, 123 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Streicker, 583 A.2d 550, 552 (R.I. 1990)). Such amphibology is not in the eye of the beholder “[with] ambiguity lurk[ing] in every word, sentence, and paragraph in the eyes of a skilled advocate * * * but whether the language has only one reasonable meaning when construed, not in a hypertechnical fashion, but in an ordinary, common sense manner.” Paul, 986 A.2d at 993', '-6- (quoting Garden City Treatment Center, Inc. v. Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004)).', 'After reviewing paragraph seven of the MSA, and after giving the terms employed their plain and ordinary meanings, we are of the opinion that paragraph seven is susceptible of two reasonable meanings and therefore is ambiguous. See Paul, 986 A.2d at 994. It would be reasonable to so conclude because there are only two triggering events specified that would accelerate the payment to Stephen and that any other discussion in the MSA about the distribution, including the formula, would affect only the amount of the payment and not the timing of its distribution. On the other hand, paragraph seven provides a distribution formula in the event the property is sold, but lists no events or occurrences that would permit a sale. Certainly, however, the term “when sold” appears to contemplate the possibility of a sale before 2024. Because the MSA does not specify when Sandra is to pay Stephen in the event of a sale, one could reasonably conclude that Stephen would receive the equitable distribution upon the sale of the property.', 'In our opinion, paragraph seven is not susceptible to merely “one reasonable meaning” when read in a “common sense manner” and it is, therefore, ambiguous. See Garden City Treatment Center, Inc., 852 A.2d at 542 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Textron, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 638 A.2d 537, 541 (R.I. 1994)).', 'Once a contract has been found to be ambiguous as a matter of law, the intent of the parties must be determined. This is a finding of fact. See O’Connell v. Finlay, 583 A.2d 546, 549 (R.I. 1990). “In construing an ambiguous contract provision, it is necessary to examine both the circumstances surrounding the development of the ambiguous terms and the intention of the parties.” Flynn v. Flynn, 615 A.2d 119, 121 (R.I. 1992). According to Rule 52(a) of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, the court “shall find the facts specially and', '-7- state separately its conclusions of law.” Cf. Connor v. Schlemmer, 996 A.2d 98, 109 (R.I. 2010) (citing Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the similar requirement of the Superior Court to make findings of fact). Here, the trial justice apparently assumed that it was the intent of the parties that their children remain in the marital domicile until 2024, when their youngest child would turn twenty-two years old. The trial justice also concluded that a logical reading of the provision would require an immediate payment to Stephen if the property was sold because the parties would not have believed that the property would be worth less than $475,000 in 2024, given that real estate historically appreciates. Even though we defer to the trial justice’s findings of fact, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not make sufficient factual findings on the record with respect to the intent of the parties, and the matter consequently cannot be accorded deference. Therefore, we remand the case to the Family Court to make findings of fact about the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the agreement with respect to the timing of the payment of the equitable distribution. In so doing, the trial justice may hear additional testimony or supplement the record with further documentation.', 'B', 'The Calculation of the Equitable Distribution', 'Secondly, Sandra argues that the trial justice erred in her calculations about the amount that defendant owed to plaintiff when the house was sold. The trial justice determined that Sandra was indebted to Stephen in the amount of $59,375, which is one-half of the difference between the sale price and $475,000. Sandra maintains that the unambiguous language of the', '-8- MSA can mean only that the amount owed to Stephen is $40,625. 4 On this point, we agree with defendant that the trial justice erred in her calculations.', 'The MSA says that Sandra will pay Stephen the sum of $100,000 as his equitable distribution for the marital domicile in 2024. Next, the MSA provides that, should the sale price of the property be for less than $475,000, Stephen’s equitable distribution “shall be reduced by 50% of the difference between the sale price and the sum of $475,000.00.” The trial justice stated that the “only logical interpretation and plain meaning” of that language would be to deduct the sale price of $356,250 from $475,000 and take fifty percent of the resulting number, which produces $59,375. We disagree. “When contract language is clear and unambiguous, words contained therein will be given their usual and ordinary meaning and the parties will be bound by such meaning.” Singer v. Singer, 692 A.2d 691, 692 (R.I. 1997) (mem.). In our opinion, the trial justice was correct in her conclusion that the language is unambiguous. However, we disagree with her application of the formula expressed by that unambiguous language. See McCulloch v. McCulloch, 69 A.3d 810, 829-30 (R.I. 2013).', 'In our view, the only reasonable interpretation of the contractual provision is that Stephen’s equitable distribution amounts to $40,625. That sum is arrived at by taking fifty percent of the difference between the sale price ($356,250) and $475,000, the result of which is $59,375. At that point, the formula is clear that the $100,000 is reduced by $59,375. The resulting total is $40,625. The trial justice appears to have simply divided the difference in half which overlooks the final step in the calculation. We have consistently held that “every word of the contract should be given meaning and effect; an interpretation that reduces certain words to 4', 'We note that in the briefings filed with this Court, Stephen acknowledges defendant’s argument, but does not respond or provide a counterargument to Sandra’s contention. However, during oral argument, Stephen maintained that the trial justice correctly applied the formula.', '-9- the status of surplusage should be rejected.” Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d at 239. Therefore, the trial justice erred in her calculation, and Sandra is obligated to pay to Stephen the amount equaling $40,625 as his equitable distribution for the property. The timing of the payment, however, is dependent upon the trial justice’s findings of fact following remand.', 'C', 'The Modification of the MSA', 'Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she ordered the parties to share equally in the payment of extracurricular activities and child-care expenses because this order improperly modified the terms of the MSA. 5 However, it is our opinion that this issue has not been properly preserved for our review. It is well settled under our raise-or-waive rule that “issues that are raised for the first time on appeal will not be reviewed by this Court.” DeAngelis v. DeAngelis, 923 A.2d 1274, 1280 (R.I. 2007). During the hearing on May 30, the trial justice said on the record that the parties had reached an agreement that the enrichment activities would be split by Sandra and Stephen equally. Sandra did not object to the trial justice’s open-court assertion that the parties had agreed to share in these costs equally, nor was any objection raised when an order to that effect was entered. Consequently, this issue has been waived, and we will not address it on appeal.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the Family Court.

Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Metropolitan or defendant) appeals from the denial of its motion to dismiss an appeal filed by David F. Miller (Miller or plaintiff). Metropolitan argues that the plaintiff’s appeal was untimely pursuant to Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure and should, therefore, be dismissed. The plaintiff counters that the appeal was not only timely, but also that the order from which he appealed had merged into a previously appealed order and, therefore, the defendant’s motion to dismiss was moot. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint against Amica Mutual Insurance Company, Amica Property and Casualty Insurance Company (collectively Amica), and Metropolitan in July 2006. 1 The plaintiff’s complaint alleged multiple counts: tortious interference with contractual relations; tortious interference with prospective contractual relations; malicious prosecution; abuse of process; continued tortious interference with contractual relations; continued tortious interference with prospective contractual relations; and violation of the Rhode Island Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The defendants were granted partial summary judgment in 2010 on all counts except abuse of process.', 'The case proceeded to trial in May 2012 on plaintiff’s abuse-of-process claims against Metropolitan and Amica. After plaintiff rested, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial justice denied the motion. The defendants again moved for judgment as a matter of law following the presentation of all evidence, and the motion was once again denied. The case was submitted to the jury, along with two separate verdict forms, one for Metropolitan and one for Amica. The jury found Metropolitan and Amica liable for abuse of process and awarded $449,544.66 in compensatory damages against each defendant, as well as $500,000 in punitive damages against Amica and $750,000 in punitive damages against Metropolitan. On May 31, 2012, judgments were entered in favor of plaintiff against Metropolitan in the amount of $1,758,950.65, including 1', 'The complaint also included Miller’s Auto Body, Inc. as a plaintiff and Allstate Insurance Company, Inc. as a defendant.

The trial justice denied Metropolitan’s motions but granted Amica’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the ground of insufficient evidence. The trial justice also conditionally granted Amica’s motion for a new trial in the event that his ruling on the motion for judgment as a matter of law was found to be erroneous. Two orders reflecting these decisions were entered on August 20, 2012, one for Metropolitan and one for Amica.', 'On August 27, 2012, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, listing Amica as the only defendant and citing the August 20, 2012 order in favor of Amica as the subject of the appeal. On August 31, 2012, Metropolitan filed a notice of appeal from the May 31, 2012 judgment and the August 20, 2012 “new trial/Rule 50 order.” In the space provided for the names of plaintiff and defendant on this notice of appeal, Metropolitan referred to an exhibit attached to its notice, which listed Metropolitan, Amica, and Allstate Insurance Co. as defendants. On September 18, 2012, plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal from the May 31, 2012 judgment, “only as it constitutes a final judgment as to Counts I, II, V, and VI of Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint.” 2 Metropolitan then filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s September 18 cross-appeal, arguing that the appeal was untimely because it was not filed within the extended twenty-day appeal period following plaintiff’s August 27 notice of appeal. 2', 'These counts were: tortious interference with contractual relations; tortious interference with prospective contractual relations; continued tortious interference with contractual relations; and continued tortious interference with prospective contractual relations. These counts were dismissed as to all defendants on a motion for partial summary judgment, which was granted in 2010.', '-3-', 'The trial justice denied Metropolitan’s motion to dismiss plaintiff’s September 18 cross- appeal. The trial justice reasoned that plaintiff’s cross-appeal was timely because it was filed within twenty days of Metropolitan’s August 31 notice of appeal. The trial justice reasoned in the alternative that plaintiff’s September 18 notice of appeal may have been unnecessary, because the order from which he appealed could have merged into the order that was the subject of his August 27 notice of appeal. Metropolitan appealed from the trial justice’s order denying its motion to dismiss plaintiff’s September 18 cross-appeal; it is this latter order that is currently under review before this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We generally use an abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing a Superior Court’s decision on a motion to dismiss an appeal.

Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1253 (R.I. 2010).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The gravamen of Metropolitan’s motion to dismiss plaintiff’s September 18 notice of appeal centered on the argument that the appeal was untimely pursuant to Rule 4(a). Rule 4(a) provides in pertinent part:', '“In a civil case the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 shall be', 'filed with the clerk of the trial court within twenty (20) days of the', 'date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from', '* * * . If a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, any other', '-4-', 'party may file a notice of appeal within twenty (20) days of the', 'date on which the first notice of appeal was filed, or within the', 'time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision, whichever period', 'last expires.”', 'The initial twenty-day appeal period in this case ran from August 21, 2012 to September 10, 2012. 3 The plaintiff’s August 27 notice of appeal was filed within this period. Pursuant to Rule 4(a), plaintiff’s August 27 notice of appeal triggered a new twenty-day period during which “any other party” could file a notice of appeal; this period ran from August 28, 2012 to September 17, 2012. 4 Metropolitan’s August 31 notice of appeal was filed within both the first and second twenty-day appeal periods. The plaintiff’s September 18 notice of cross-appeal, however, was not filed within either of these twenty-day periods.', 'The plaintiff argues that his September 18 notice of cross-appeal was timely because a new twenty-day appeal period began to run upon the filing of Metropolitan’s August 31 notice of appeal. This period would have run from September 1, 2012 to September 20, 2012. The plaintiff asserts that Metropolitan’s August 31 appeal triggered a new twenty-day period pursuant to Rule 4(a) because “[t]his was the first notice of an appeal that was adverse to [plaintiff’s] interest.” Metropolitan disagrees; it contends that “[b]ecause [its August 31] notice of appeal was the second notice of appeal filed in this matter, [it] did not alter or affect the extended appeal period under Rule 4(a).” Thus, according to Metropolitan, the twenty-day appeal period triggered by plaintiff’s August 27 notice of appeal, ending on September 17, was the only “extended appeal period” provided in this case pursuant to Rule 4(a), and any appeals filed after September 17 would be untimely. 3', 'Counting August 21 as day one, September 9 would have been day twenty. However, September 9, 2012 was a Sunday, which means that the appeal period was extended by one day. See Article I, Rule 20(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. 4', 'Once again, the twenty-day period would have ended on September 16, 2012 but was extended by one day because September 16 was a Sunday.', '-5-', 'The trial justice accepted plaintiff’s construction of Rule 4(a), electing to treat plaintiff’s August 27 appeal and Metropolitan’s August 31 appeal as “distinct appeals,” and allowing a “20- day period to run after a filing as to each particular document that [was] filed in this particular matter.” The trial justice relied in part on a case that construed the federal counterpart to our Rule 4(a), which interpreted the phrase “first notice of appeal” to mean the first notice filed by an adverse party. See Lee v. Coahoma County, Mississippi, 937 F.2d 220, 223 (5th Cir. 1991).', 'We have previously stated that “where the federal rule and our state rule of procedure are substantially similar, we will look to the federal courts for guidance [and] interpretation of our own rule.” Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838, 840 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Smith v. Johns-Manville Corp., 489 A.2d 336, 339 (R.I. 1985)). Rule 4(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure mirrors our Rule 4(a) in all material respects. 5 The Committee Note to the initial version of the federal rule “indicated that the provision would remedy the difficulties that arose when a party who had no wish to appeal unless its adversary appealed learned of the adversary’s appeal only after the running of the original appeal time.” 16A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 3950.7 (4th ed.).', 'After reviewing this historical context, we agree with the court in Lee, cited by the trial justice in the instant case, that “Rule 4(a)(3)’s purpose [is] to allow all parties an opportunity to see and respond to the actions of their adversaries.” Lee, 937 F.2d at 223. Applying this rationale to our own Rule 4(a), it is clear that the rule should be interpreted to provide a twenty-day appeal period after the first timely notice of appeal from an adverse party. 5', 'Rule 4(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides as follows: “Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.”', '-6-', 'In the procedural posture of this particular case, plaintiff’s August 27 notice and Metropolitan’s August 31 notice must be conceptualized as two distinct appeals. The trial justice issued two separate orders on August 20: one for Amica and one for Metropolitan, with opposite results. The plaintiff’s August 27 notice of appeal listed only Amica as defendant, with “August 20, 2012” as the “Date of Judgment/Order Appealed From,” and the box labeled “Defendant(s)” was checked for the prevailing party. This notice of appeal indicates an intention to appeal only the trial court’s decision in favor of Amica; furthermore, the parties agree that this appeal did not involve Metropolitan. 6', 'Thus, it was not until Metropolitan’s August 31 notice of appeal that plaintiff even became aware that Metropolitan would also be involved in appellate proceedings in this case. The procedural posture of this scenario put plaintiff into the category of “a party who had no wish to appeal unless [his] adversary appealed,” with Metropolitan being the adverse party. See 16A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 3950.7 (4th ed.). Therefore, the purpose behind Rule 4(a) supports an interpretation that provides an additional twenty-day appeal period triggered by an appeal—such as Metropolitan’s—that constitutes the first appeal adverse to a potential cross- appellant’s interests.', 'In Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 291 n.12 (R.I. 2007), we noted that the introductory language of this Court’s Rules of Appellate Procedure “states that the rules are to be construed so as ‘to promote the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every matter that comes before the Supreme Court.’” Although the twenty-day appeal period is jurisdictional and may not be waived absent a finding of excusable neglect, see Wachovia Bank v. Hershberger, 6', 'Indeed, Metropolitan asserts that plaintiff “did not even serve a copy of the August 27 notice of appeal on Metropolitan’s counsel at the time it was filed.”', '-7- 911 A.2d 278, 280 (R.I. 2006) (mem.), we are constrained to conclude that a literal interpretation of Rule 4(a) in this context would lead to an unjust, illogical, and indeed absurd, result.', 'In this case, plaintiff was the first party to file an appeal. A strict reading of the rule permits only “any other party” to receive the benefit of a second twenty-day appeal period. 7 Even if we were to interpret Rule 4(a) as granting the original appellant an additional twenty-day period triggered by his own notice of appeal, one party could foreclose another from filing a cross-appeal simply by waiting until the final day of the second appeal period to file his notice of appeal. For example, if we construe Rule 4(a) in the manner suggested by Metropolitan, the following scenario would have been possible: if Metropolitan had waited until September 17 (the final day of the twenty-day appeal period beginning with plaintiff’s August 27 appeal) to file its appeal, then plaintiff, upon receiving notice of this appeal, would have been unable to assert a timely cross-appeal regarding the pretrial order decided in favor of Metropolitan. 8', 'This interpretation of Rule 4(a) would have forced the plaintiff to file a preemptive appeal against Metropolitan, in order to protect his interests in the event that Metropolitan chose 7', 'Procedural rules, like statutes and ordinances, should not be understood in a manner that can only be described as “myopic literalism.” Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 425 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012)). Keeping that principle in mind, we are convinced that Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure should “be read in its proper context, not viewed in isolation.” In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 149 (R.I. 2006) (citing McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136, 139 (1991)). In our opinion, the “proper context” of Rule 4(a) militates against the narrow reading for which Metropolitan has advocated. 8', 'It appears that plaintiff in this case had to file a cross-appeal in order to challenge the trial justice’s pretrial ruling in favor of Metropolitan. See David A. Wollin, Rhode Island Appellate Procedure § 4:5, 4-11 (West 2004) (“A cross appeal is not necessary when the appellee simply wants to defend the judgment obtained below, even if it is on grounds different from those on which the judgment was based. However, if the prevailing party in the trial court wishes to overturn one of the lower court’s rulings below, a cross appeal must be filed.”). Furthermore, if Metropolitan had not filed any notice of appeal in this case, it would have been unfairly prejudicial to allow plaintiff to challenge—in the context of his appeal against Amica—the pretrial order decided in favor of Metropolitan.', '-8- to file its own notice of appeal at the end of the second twenty-day appeal period. We decline to interpret Rule 4(a) in a manner that would allow a party to gain an unfair tactical advantage by simply waiting until the twentieth day to file its notice of appeal and which, consequently, would produce unnecessary, preemptive appeals. Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiff’s September 18 notice of cross-appeal was timely because it was filed within the twenty-day period triggered by Metropolitan’s August 31 notice of appeal, which was the first notice in this matter filed by a party adverse to the plaintiff’s interests. 9', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Goldberg and Justice Indeglia did not participate. 9', 'The plaintiff also asserts that the doctrine of merger should apply to this case, rendering his September 18 cross-appeal superfluous and Metropolitan’s motion to dismiss his cross-appeal moot. Because we have determined that plaintiff’s September 18 cross-appeal was timely filed pursuant to Rule 4(a), we need not address the issue of merger.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'David F.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Pursuant to multiple contracts beginning in 1998, Joseph Pilosa operated a service for the transportation of human remains from various locations in the state to the Office of Medical Examiners (OME), which is a subdivision of the Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH). 2 Pilosa’s transportation company was called JPL Livery Services (JPL), and Pilosa served as its president. The contract at issue in this case covered a five-year period from July 1, 2005 until June 30, 2010, and it provided a “cost per case” price of $125 for transports from the greater Providence area, and $130 for all other areas of the state.', 'The state selected JPL as its livery service provider through a bidding process. The terms of JPL’s contract with the state were set forth in two documents: the notice of price agreement award, which listed basic contract terms such as price and termination criteria, and the bid solicitation, which provided specific requirements for JPL’s performance of the service contract and which was incorporated by reference into the notice of price agreement award. The notice of price agreement award contained the following language: 2', 'This livery service consisted of responding to a call from the OME that provided the location of a decedent, driving to that location, assisting the on-scene investigator with handling the body and sometimes placing a toe tag on the body for identification, inserting the body into a bag, and then removing the bagged body and transporting it to the OME.', '-2-', '“This is a multi-year bid/contract. Per Rhode Island state law 37-', '2-33, contract obligations beyond the current fiscal year are subject', 'to availability of funds. Continuation of the contract beyond the', 'initial fiscal year will be at the discretion of the state. Termination', 'may be effected by the state based upon determining factors such', 'as unsatisfactory performance or the determination by the state to', 'discontinue the goods/services, or to revise the scope and need for', 'the type of goods/services; also management owner determinations', 'that may preclude the need for goods/services.', '“Delivery of goods or services as requested by agency.” The bid solicitation also provided that JPL’s livery services were “to be provided to the [OME] on a 24/7/365 basis as requested by the [OME] staff.” From July 2005 until March 2006, JPL was the OME’s sole livery service provider. Pilosa testified at trial that JPL had also been the sole transportation provider pursuant to a previous contract beginning in the year 2000.', 'In October 2005, Robert O’Donnell was hired as Medicolegal Administrator of the OME, which put him “in charge of [the OME’s] daily operations.” O’Donnell held a meeting with Pilosa in March 2006, in which Pilosa was informed that O’Donnell would be limiting the number of transports to be conducted by JPL. O’Donnell told Pilosa that personnel from the OME, as well as agents and scene investigators, would assume transportation duties between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Saturday. O’Donnell explained at trial that the DOH was “looking for ways to reduce [the OME’s] budget,” and he determined that it would be less expensive for the state to use its own personnel rather than pay JPL’s “cost per case” transport fee. After this meeting, the state significantly reduced its use of JPL’s services.', 'JPL filed suit against the state, the Director of the DOH, the Chief Medical Examiner, and O’Donnell in May 2006, alleging that O’Donnell breached the contract when he decreased JPL’s transportation services and began using OME employees to fill in the gaps. JPL sought a', '-3- temporary restraining order, 3 injunctive relief, and compensatory damages. JPL continued to provide livery services for the state while the litigation was pending.', 'The contract also required JPL to provide the state with certain documentation regarding JPL’s employees, vehicles, and insurance policies. Specifically, the contract mandated that JPL provide “proof of valid driver[’]s licenses for all employees,” “proof of workers[’] compensation insurance,” and “proof of background checks done on all employees.” The contract further required JPL to “provide to the [OME] any changes in personnel,” and to “immediately” provide the above documentation for new employees. JPL was also required to provide license plate numbers and proof of insurance for its vehicles and to submit annual insurance renewal certificates for its insurance policies. Additionally, the contract contained criteria for the manner in which JPL was to conduct its transportation services, including a time limit for responding to a scene after receiving a call from the OME. The contract also specified that, “[u]pon removal of a decedent from the scene location, [JPL] will proceed directly to the [OME] office unless directed to do otherwise by the Medical Examiner.”', 'In 2007, DOH personnel authored several letters indicating various issues with JPL’s transportation services. Pilosa received a letter from O’Donnell dated January 25, 2007, in which O’Donnell referred to an incident involving “[JPL] employees stopping after picking up a decedent for the [OME] and not responding directly to [OME].” Pilosa also received a letter from O’Donnell dated March 22, 2007, which referenced an incident where one of Pilosa’s employees had made an error in writing a decedent’s name on a toe tag.', 'The Chief Medical Examiner wrote a letter to Pilosa dated April 27, 2007, in which he indicated that JPL’s “liability contract” and “workers[’] compensation insurance contract” were 3', 'JPL’s motion for a temporary restraining order was denied.', '-4- outdated. This letter also requested license plate numbers and proof of insurance for JPL’s vehicles, as well as a list of “all past and present [JPL] employees under the current contract,” and documentation including driver’s licenses, background checks, and records of employee training. This letter requested that JPL provide the missing documents by May 4, 2007. JPL’s attorney then received a letter dated May 25, 2007, from the Acting Assistant Director of Health, which referred to the information requested in the April 27, 2007 letter and stated that “[t]he purchase order and contract for services require that this information be provided to the [DOH] on an annual basis,” and that, “[a]s of this date, the Medical Examiner has not received any information from Mr. Pilosa * * * .”', 'O’Donnell sent a letter to the Assistant Director for Special Projects within the state’s Department of Administration (DOA), dated June 29, 2007, which asserted a “formal complaint against [JPL] * * * based on poor performance and not meeting the requirements of [the contract].” Specifically, O’Donnell wrote that a JPL employee had been arrested in May 2005 for stealing a credit card from a decedent, and another decedent’s son had filed a complaint in 2006 regarding money that went missing from his father’s wallet while JPL employees were transporting the body.', 'O’Donnell also referred to incidents listed in his letters to Pilosa, including JPL incorrectly labeling a decedent and JPL failing to timely provide required documentation. O’Donnell wrote in the final paragraph of the letter: “Based on the above information * * * we are formally requesting that the contract with JPL * * * be terminated immediately. The lack of response raises very serious concerns about the integrity of services provided by the contractor and the potential for harm to the citizens of Rhode Island.”', '-5-', 'JPL’s counsel then received a letter dated July 19, 2007, from Jerome Moynihan, who was the Administrator of Purchasing Systems within the DOA, 4 in which Moynihan stated that “DOH maintains that JPL failed to timely provide to DOH required updates on JPL’s insurance coverage, bond status, vehicle registration information and criminal background checks for JPL employees.” Moynihan also stated in this letter, however, that “DOA is aware that JPL is now in substantial compliance with DOH’s request for production and documentation.” Moynihan warned that “any future failure by JPL to comply with the terms of its contract with the State shall result in punitive action being taken, including but not limited to, termination of JPL’s contract with the State.” Moynihan testified at trial that he viewed this letter as an “an olive branch,” meaning that JPL would be allowed “time to remediate” past faults regarding its contractual obligations.', 'Roughly four months later, Pilosa received another letter from the Chief Medical Examiner, Thomas Gilson, MD, dated November 30, 2007, which listed nine JPL employees for whom the state had not received required documentation, including driver’s licenses and background checks. Doctor Gilson also requested documentation of JPL’s current liability insurance coverage. This letter warned that, “[i]f the [OME] is not in receipt of the above documentation by December 6, 2007, [OME] will seek termination of your contract. Further, be advised that any other non-compliance and/or violation of the terms of the contract will result in termination without additional warning.”', 'Pilosa also received a letter from Dr. Gilson dated December 5, 2007, in which Dr. Gilson complained that Pilosa had transported a deceased two-year-old child from a hospital in 4', 'Moynihan testified that as Administrator of Purchasing Systems, he would receive requisitions from the DOH outlining a need for services and was responsible for soliciting bids to fill these needs.', '-6- his arms, and that “[t]his transport involved passing by the cafeteria window, which upset several people there.” This letter also stated that “[t]his conduct is unacceptable and has been addressed with you previously by the prior Chief Medical Examiner when a similar complaint was lodged by South County Hospital.” At trial, Pilosa denied having passed by a cafeteria while carrying this body from the hospital, and he stated that it was his practice to not place the bodies of small children and infants on adult-sized stretchers. 5', 'The state terminated JPL’s contract on December 10, 2007. Pilosa received notice of the termination in a letter from Moynihan, which stated that, “[p]ursuant to the bid award, the State of Rhode Island may, with or without cause, terminate services within the sole discretion of the State.” The letter also stated that, notwithstanding this discretion, “the State has determined that JPL is in serious violation of the terms of the award.” The letter enumerated three specific violations: background checks on six of the nine JPL employees listed in Dr. Gilson’s November 2007 letter revealed criminal records; JPL had taken more than its allotted one hour to arrive at the locations of decedents on two occasions in August 2007; and JPL had violated established protocol by transporting a child in arms rather than on a carrier under a protective covering, as mentioned in the December 2007 letter.', 'JPL filed a second lawsuit in December 2008 against the DOA and the DOH, alleging that the state breached the contract by terminating the agreement in bad faith and without cause. 6 The two cases were consolidated in August 2010 and tried without a jury for six days in March 5', 'As for the letter’s reference to a similar complaint lodged in the past, Pilosa explained that a hospital employee had previously complained because Pilosa had not backed his truck into the proper loading area, which Pilosa explained was due to the fact that there was a laundry cart in the area that was too heavy to move. 6', 'JPL also filed an amended verified complaint for the 2006 lawsuit in May 2010, which added Rosemary Booth Gallogly and Jerome D. Moynihan as defendants.', '-7- and April 2012. The trial consisted primarily of the testimonies of Pilosa, O’Donnell, and Moynihan.', 'Before trial, the state made a motion in limine to prohibit plaintiff from mentioning or introducing evidence to suggest that the contract was an exclusive agreement between the state and JPL. The trial justice preliminarily denied the motion and then issued a bench decision granting the motion on the fifth day of trial. She found that the language of the contract was clear and unambiguous, and that there was “no language [in the contract] to suggest the DOH was required to exclusively use JPL for its transportation needs.” The trial justice further found:', '“[T]he contract clearly states that JPL was to pick up and deliver', 'the decedents’ bodies only when the DOH requested it to do so. A', 'plain reading of that language suggests that were the DOH to', 'decide it wanted to use other vendors for its transportation', 'requirements or to have its own employees make these deliveries,', 'as it was done here, the DOH could do so.” Accordingly, the trial justice ruled that JPL was prohibited from introducing parol or extrinsic evidence to suggest that the parties intended the contract to be exclusive.', 'At the conclusion of plaintiff’s case, the DOH and the DOA moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 52 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial justice reserved her decision and at the conclusion of testimony instructed the parties to file post- trial memoranda. On December 26, 2012, the trial justice issued an eighteen-page decision finding that “the State lawfully terminated its contract with JPL in good faith and that the State did not breach the same contract by using its own employees for livery services prior to termination.” Judgment for defendants was entered on January 2, 2013, and plaintiff timely appealed.', '-8-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires a trial justice in a nonjury case to “find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon * * * .” The trial justice, however, “need not engage in extensive analysis to comply with this requirement.” Connor v.

Cullen, 15 A.3d at 977.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'JPL’s Exclusivity Argument', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erroneously interpreted the contract to allow for the OME’s use of its own personnel, rather than solely JPL’s personnel, for transporting human remains. In this vein, plaintiff contends that the trial justice should not have granted the state’s motion in limine regarding extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent to form an exclusive agreement. The state, on the other hand, argues that the trial justice correctly discerned that the plain meaning of the contractual language “as requested” did not create an exclusive agreement.', 'The determination of whether a contract’s terms are ambiguous is a question of law to be decided by the court. Furtado v. Goncalves, 63 A.3d 533, 537 (R.I. 2013). We review questions of law de novo. Cullen, 15 A.3d at 977.

Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 128 (R.I. 2012)).

Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Here, the contract provided in both the notice of price agreement award and the bid solicitation that JPL’s services were to be provided “as requested” by the state. The plain and ordinary meaning of this phrase indicates that JPL was obligated only to transport human remains when the state desired it to do so. This language is not ambiguous, and we find nothing else in the contract to suggest that the state was required to rely solely on JPL for its livery needs. The state, therefore, did not breach or alter the terms of the contract when it began using its own personnel for some of its transportation needs in March 2006. Because the contractual language is clear and unambiguous, plaintiff’s subjective intent as to whether the agreement was exclusive has no bearing on the outcome of this issue. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s grant of the state’s motion in limine regarding extrinsic evidence of intent, as well as her ruling that the contract was not an exclusive agreement.', 'B', 'Termination of the Contract at the State’s Discretion', 'The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice made an error of law when she interpreted the contract’s termination language. According to plaintiff, the contract allowed for unilateral termination only “at certain times, and for specific reasons.” Specifically, plaintiff states that the contract could be terminated for “untimely insurance filings” or for “lack of funds,” circumstances which, according to plaintiff, did not form the basis for the state’s termination in December 2007. The notice of price agreement award contains two paragraphs that discuss termination of the contract. The plaintiff emphasizes the following two sentences from these paragraphs:', '- 11 -', '“Continuation of the contract beyond the initial fiscal year will be', 'at the discretion of the state. Termination may be effected by the', 'state based upon determining factors such as unsatisfactory', 'performance or the determination by the state to discontinue the', 'goods/services, or to revise the scope and need for the type of', 'goods/services; also management owner determinations that may', 'preclude the need for goods/services.”', 'The plaintiff argues that “the only way to interpret” this language is “to create a limited time and cause requirement that resembles a probationary period.” The plaintiff contends that the state could avail itself of this termination clause only within the first fiscal year of the contract. According to plaintiff, the trial justice’s interpretation of the contract allowed the state to “unilaterally void the contract at any time and for any reason, or for no reason whatsoever,” rendering the agreement illusory. The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice’s interpretation caused another clause in the contract, which reads “This is a multi-year bid/contract,” to be mere “surplusage” because the state could cancel at any time. The plaintiff further contends that “[i]n order to properly terminate [JPL] for reasons or at times other than as specified in the Contract, the State should have been required to establish ‘material breach.’” The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by applying a “good faith” standard rather than a material breach standard.', 'The state, for its part, argues that the trial justice correctly interpreted the contract to allow for lawful termination at the state’s discretion after the initial fiscal year. The state further argues that each of its articulated reasons for the termination—unsatisfactory performance and failure to provide documentation—provided an independent justification for termination. The state also contends that the trial justice correctly found that the state exceeded its good faith obligations because it articulated reasons for terminating the contract, and because plaintiff failed to prove that the state acted in bad faith.', '- 12 -', 'We begin by addressing plaintiff’s allegation that the trial justice’s interpretation of the contract rendered it illusory. “It is a fundamental principle of contract law that a bilateral contract requires mutuality of obligation.” Centerville Builders, Inc. v. Wynne, 683 A.2d 1340, 1341 (R.I. 1996). “This mutuality is achieved when both parties are ‘legally bound through the making of reciprocal promises.’” Id. (quoting Crellin Technologies, Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying Rhode Island law)). The words of a promise “are illusory if they are conditional on some fact or event that is wholly under the promisor’s control and bringing it about is left wholly to the promisor’s own will and discretion,” such that “the words used do not in fact purport to limit future action in any way.” 2 Corbin on Contracts, § 5.32 at 175, 176 (1995). Generally, “termination clauses supported by adequate consideration are not illusory, but if a termination clause allows a party to terminate at any time at will without more, that promise is illusory.” Holliston Mills, Inc. v. Citizens Trust Co., 604 A.2d 331, 335 (R.I. 1992).', 'In this case, JPL agreed to provide transportation services upon the state’s request. In return, the state agreed to compensate JPL at the contractual rate. In addition, JPL agreed to abide by the state’s requirements set forth in the contract for the manner in which it was to conduct its transportation services, and JPL agreed to provide the state with certain documentation. The state’s termination rights were also a part of this bargain. Pursuant to the contract’s unambiguous language, the state retained the discretion to discontinue the contract after the initial fiscal year, with “unsatisfactory performance” listed as one potential cause for termination. Thus, we agree with the trial justice’s finding that, “according to the clear language of the Contract, it was the intention of the parties to allow the State to end requests for livery services and to terminate the contractual relationship with JPL under appropriate conditions.”', '- 13 -', 'We are of the opinion that the contract’s termination language does not render the agreement illusory, because the state was not permitted “to terminate at any time at will without more.” See Holliston Mills, Inc., 604 A.2d at 335. Rather, the state was obligated to maintain the contractual relationship throughout the first fiscal year and was further obligated to continue to compensate JPL for its services at the agreed-upon rate as long as the contract remained in force thereafter. We think it is clear that the phrase “This is a multi-year bid/contract,” along with the contract’s stated “effective period” of July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2010, merely set a time limit at the end of which the overall agreement would expire.', 'Furthermore, we are satisfied that this agreement provided mutuality of obligation because the state was statutorily required to exercise good faith in carrying out its contractual relationship with JPL. See G.L. 1956 § 37-2-3(b) (providing that “[e]very contract or duty under [chapter 2 of title 37] shall impose upon both parts the obligation of good faith in its performance and/or enforcement”). 7 In this context, “good faith” is defined as “honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.” Id. Thus, the state could not terminate the contract upon a mere claim of dissatisfaction; it was obligated to exercise its termination rights with honesty and commercial reasonableness. 7', 'According to G.L. 1956 § 37-2-4,', '“[Chapter 2] shall apply to every expenditure of public', 'funds by any state governmental entity except as otherwise', 'provided by law, by this state, or a public agency under any', 'contract or like business agreement, excepting only those contracts', 'or like business agreements where the state purchases goods or', 'services from its political subdivisions or other governmental', 'entities.” Additionally, the state referred to this chapter in its contract with JPL, which stated: “Per Rhode Island state law 37-2-33, contract obligations beyond the current fiscal year are subject to availability of funds.”', '- 14 -', 'The state terminated its contract with JPL in December 2007, more than two years after the agreement came into effect, and the termination letter provided JPL with three examples of “violations” that had occurred during the contract period: background checks on six JPL employees revealed criminal records; JPL had taken more than its allotted one hour to arrive at the locations of two decedents; and JPL had transported a child in arms rather than on a carrier. In addition to these enumerated violations, the state had communicated to Pilosa various complaints about JPL’s services throughout 2007 and had repeatedly warned that the contract could be terminated.', 'The trial justice addressed plaintiff’s argument that “the termination was an extension of O’Donnell’s alleged ‘vendetta’ against JPL,” and concluded that “JPL provided no credible evidence that the State or its employees demonstrated any bad faith at all towards JPL in the time period leading up to termination of the Contract.” After reviewing the record, we perceive nothing to indicate that the trial justice was clearly wrong, and we do not find that she misconceived or overlooked material evidence in her determination that the state was honest and reasonable in the exercise of its contractual relationship with JPL. We concur with the trial justice’s determinations that the contract was not illusory, and that the state did not breach the agreement by exercising its right to terminate upon a finding of unsatisfactory performance.', 'C', 'Alleged Factual Errors', 'The plaintiff also contends that the trial justice made errors in her findings of fact. The plaintiff argues that the trial justice relied on alleged wrongdoing that occurred during a previous contract period to establish JPL’s poor performance, and that each alleged act should have been considered separately to determine whether it constituted a breach. The plaintiff further argues', '- 15 - that the trial justice erred by determining credibility in favor of Moynihan and O’Donnell, and against two other OME employees, Carl Zambrano and Angela Harwood. 8', 'The trial justice in this case produced a thorough, well-written decision that clearly explained her findings of fact and credibility determinations. She found that JPL’s performance during the contract period supplied the state with legitimate reasons for dissatisfaction, including the failure to provide a background check for one of its employees and the discovery that multiple JPL employees had extensive criminal records. The record reveals additional reasons for the state’s dissatisfaction with JPL’s services, including the incident with the mislabeled toe tag, the removal of a deceased child in arms rather than on a carrier, and JPL’s tardiness in supplying insurance documentation. We cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong in finding that these incidents of misconduct were sufficient to cause the state to be dissatisfied with JPL’s performance.', 'Additionally, the trial justice found Moynihan’s and O’Donnell’s testimonies “relating to the cost-cutting measures and dissatisfaction with JPL’s services” to be “extremely credible.” On the other hand, the trial justice gave “little weight” to Harwood’s testimony and noted that Zambrano “had a history of disputes with O’Donnell as he had previously filed two complaints against the Chief Medical Examiner.” After giving the trial justice’s credibility findings the 8', 'Angela Harwood worked as a “medicolegal death scene investigator” and was responsible for calling the livery service after determining that a body would have to be transported to the OME. Harwood also testified that she worked with JPL on scene and had no complaints about its services. Harwood, however, had never read the contract at issue in this case, was not familiar with its terms, and did not know whether JPL’s performance complied with the contract’s requirements. Carl Zambrano also worked as an investigator for the OME in 2006. He testified that it was his policy to grant permission for JPL to make additional stops after picking up a body and before returning to the OME. Zambrano also testified that he had filed an informal complaint against O’Donnell in early 2006, in part because of the policy that changed JPL’s on- call hours for transportation services, and in part because, according to Zambrano, O’Donnell “was very hard to deal with,” was untrustworthy, and was causing low morale within the agency.', '- 16 - “great weight” that they are due, we have no reason to disturb them on appeal.

On appeal, the defendant argues that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that the defendant violated the terms of his probation.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On January 4, 2007, defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to a single count of possession of a controlled substance, for which he was sentenced to five years probation. On January 26, 2011, detectives of the Providence police department arrested defendant and charged him with possession of heroin. The state subsequently filed a violation notice pursuant to Rule', '-1- 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure against defendant detailing the circumstances of the arrest and basis for the probation violation.', 'A probation-violation hearing was conducted on June 13 and 15, 2011, before the Superior Court. Detective John J. Black of the Providence police department testified to the events of January 26, 2011. According to Det. Black, Providence police officers working in the narcotics division received information from police in the City of Newport that defendant traveled to Providence several times per week for the purpose of purchasing heroin for later resale in the City of Newport. Detective Black testified that part of the information delivered to the Providence police department included a description of defendant’s mode of transportation: a Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) bus. He stated that, based on this information, detectives from the Providence police department surveilled the Kennedy Plaza bus station. Detective Black went on to state that he was aware of defendant’s physical appearance because he had arrested defendant previously. He described how the detectives observed defendant arriving at Kennedy Plaza and changing buses; Det. Black followed defendant onto the bus and the detectives continued to monitor defendant as he traveled.', 'Detective Black testified that defendant traveled to an address within the city, meeting two other males there and leaving with them in a Jeep Cherokee. Detective Black stated that, after observing defendant’s vehicle for some time, officers watched as the vehicle parked on Elmwood Avenue. Detective Black stated that he then observed defendant exit the vehicle, step onto the sidewalk, put his little finger into a clear plastic bag containing a white substance, and touch his little finger to his tongue. Detective Black testified at the violation hearing that this action, known colloquially as “lacing,” is a known street-level drug test used to assay controlled substances. Detective Black stated that he and other police officers approached defendant,', '-2- identified themselves as police officers, and witnessed defendant drop the transparent bag to the ground.', 'Detective Black testified that he and another member of the Providence police department arrested defendant and secured the transparent bag. The bag and its contents were entered as a full exhibit.', 'Detective Black testified that, after securing defendant and having him transported to the central police station, he took custody of the plastic bag, returned with it to the central station, and tested it with a “Marquis Reagent” 1 field test.', 'Detective Black described the test’s operation: the test contains a substance that, when combined with heroin or other opiate derivatives, turns purple. Detective Black testified that, when he administered the test to a small sample of the substance in the bag, it turned purple, indicating the presence of heroin. The defendant objected to the lack of a full toxicology report on the substance, and questioned the validity of the field test.', 'Detective Black stated that he had noticed that a nearby liquor store had video surveillance cameras facing the street, and he requested that the store’s owner or manager allow him to view any footage of the arrest. The footage, which was made a full exhibit, revealed that the store’s cameras had recorded part of the arrest.', 'The hearing justice found Det. Black to be a credible witness. The hearing justice also found that the recorded footage from the liquor store coincided with and corroborated Det. Black’s testimony. The hearing justice found that, based on Det. Black’s testimony and the corroborating video footage, defendant had violated the conditions of his probation by failing to keep the peace and maintain good behavior. 1', 'The “Marquis Reagent” is created by adding 100 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to 5 mL of a mixture of 40 percent formaldehyde and 60 percent water.

Our review of the record in this case convinces us that the hearing justice was well warranted in concluding that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his probation.', 'The state presented eyewitness testimony from Det. Black, whom the hearing justice found to be credible.

Notwithstanding the fact that he has conducted “hundreds of field tests,” he said that he had never seen or heard of a situation where such a field test produced a false positive result. Although he was somewhat unclear whether the Marquis Reagent field test tests specifically for heroin or more generally for opium', '-5- derivatives, he was absolutely certain that the white substance in the bag that defendant dropped tested positive.', 'According appropriate deference to the hearing justice’s credibility determinations, we are satisfied that he had ample evidence before him upon which to rest his finding of probation violation. Even if we accept, arguendo, the defendant’s contention that the field test did not identify the contents of the bag as heroin, but only some opiate derivative, the hearing justice was presented with evidence sufficient to make a rational finding that the defendant violated the terms and conditions of his probation.

On July 21, 2004, Wilfredo Nunez and Janette Campos entered into a purchase and sales agreement for a home located at 25 Oak St. in the City of Woonsocket.

As a result of this discovery, plaintiffs initiated claims under their homeowners’ insurance policy issued by Merrimack.', 'Merrimack’s investigator, Richard Mansfield of Aegis Engineering Services, Inc.

Merrimack presented evidence from Aegis and Taraco indicating that the leak in plaintiffs’ oil feed line was caused by a slow, gradual corrosion. The plaintiffs, however, offered no evidence to the contrary. To wedge the loss resulting from the gradually corroded oil feed line into the category of “[s]udden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system” would require the creation of an ambiguity where one does not exist.', 'Further, assuming arguendo that we were to adopt the plaintiffs’ interpretation of Textron and determine that the loss was “sudden and accidental” from their perspective, the damage would nevertheless remain uncovered under the policy.', 'The plain language of the policy protects against loss caused by the “[s]udden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system.” The plaintiffs, however, failed to present any evidence indicating that the loss was due to such a tearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging; therefore, whether or not the damage was sudden and accidental is of no moment. Because the undisputed evidence indicates that the damage to the plaintiffs’ property was caused by corrosion—damage not covered by their insurance policy—there remain no genuine issues of material fact and Merrimack is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.', '-6-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed, and the record of this case shall be returned thereto.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Wilfredo Nunez et al. v.

The plaintiff, acting as subcontractor to Providence Builders, LLC (Providence Builders or builder), performed work on a property in the City of Providence that was owned by Capital Properties and leased by Capitol Cove. When a dispute arose regarding payment, the plaintiff sought to enforce a mechanics’ lien against the owner, the lessee, and the builder. Pursuant to the provisions of Rhode Island’s Mechanics’ Lien Statute (lien statute), G.L. 1956 chapter 28 of title 34, the plaintiff’s claim against Capital Properties and Capitol Cove was dismissed after the posting of a $400,000 bond, with Liberty 1', 'Capitol Cove, LLC was defaulted for failure to file a brief in this appeal. 2', 'Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[w]hen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action * * * the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay * * * .”', '-1- Mutual Insurance Co.

After a hearing on the motions, the trial justice denied the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment in favor of Capital Properties and Capitol Cove. It is this decision that is the subject of the instant appeal.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in denying its motion for summary judgment, and in entering final judgment in favor of Capital Properties and Capitol Cove. The plaintiff argues that the owner, lessee, and surety are all directly liable for the relief sought under the mechanics’ lien statute, and that, because plaintiff complied with the requirements of the lien statute, judgment should be awarded in its favor. 5 For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-28-17(b)(2) states, in pertinent part:', '“In the event that the complaint has been filed with the', 'appropriate superior court, and after depositing cash or the bond of', 'a surety company and discharging the notice of intention and lis', 'pendens, and dismissing the cause as noted in this section, the lien', 'plaintiff shall amend the complaint, to include the surety as', 'defendant within sixty (60) days after the person or entity claiming', 'the lien is given notice of the order in regard to the bond.” 4', 'A copy of plaintiff’s motion was not submitted with the record for this appeal. 5', 'The plaintiff also argued that the Superior Court erred in denying its motion to increase the bond.

Capitol Cove entered into a ground lease with Capital Properties. Capitol Cove then entered into a contract with Providence Builders for the construction of a condominium development on the property. Builder, as construction manager, then entered into a subcontract with plaintiff to install the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for the development. A dispute arose between plaintiff and builder concerning payment, and plaintiff recorded a lien against the property and also filed a complaint to enforce that lien pursuant to the lien statute. 6', 'Owner and lessee filed an ex parte motion to discharge the lien upon deposit of a bond with the Registry of the Court, pursuant to § 34-28-17. 7 On March 16, 2009, the Superior Court granted the motion upon the deposit of a bond in the amount of $207,522.32 with the Registry of the Court. The plaintiff moved to vacate that order, and the parties appeared before a second Superior Court justice who granted plaintiff’s motion and issued a new order increasing the amount of the bond to $400,000. The plaintiff then moved to vacate this later order, this time on the grounds that the builder was the principal on the bond, rather than the owner and lessee. After a hearing on June 4, 2009, a third Superior Court justice held that the lien statute permits the owner or lessee to deposit cash or a bond into the registry, and she granted plaintiff’s motion 6', 'The specific grounds for this dispute between plaintiff and builder are not relevant to the instant appeal. 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-28-17(a) provides that the owner, lessee, or tenant of property against which a lien has been filed may deposit cash or a bond in the Registry of the Court, equal to the amount of the lien. Upon proof that this deposit has been made, the owner, lessee, or tenant may request that the lien be discharged and the complaint against them be dismissed. This section will be discussed in more detail infra.', '-3- to vacate. Thereupon, on June 26, 2009, owner and lessee deposited a bond in the amount of $400,000 with the Registry of the Court; builder remained on the bond, with Liberty as surety. At the same time, owner and lessee filed another ex parte motion to dismiss and to discharge the lien; the motion was granted that same day.', 'Pursuant to § 34-28-17(b)(2), plaintiff amended its complaint, naming Capital Properties, Capitol Cove, Providence Builders, and Liberty as defendants. The first count of the amended complaint demanded payment of $207,522.32 plus costs, fees, and interest for work performed and materials used in the construction of the condominium development from Capital Properties, Capitol Cove, and Liberty, as surety, under the provisions of the lien statute. The second count, which is not at issue in this appeal, asserted a claim against builder for breach of contract. In their answers to the amended complaint, defendants asserted thirteen affirmative defenses, including setoff, and builder asserted counterclaims for negligence, breach of contract, and contractual indemnity.', 'The plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on the first count; defendants objected and Capital Properties and Capitol Cove filed cross-motions requesting that final judgment enter in their favor pursuant to Rule 54(b). 8 At a hearing on November 23, 2010, the hearing justice denied plaintiff’s motion and granted summary judgment to Capital Properties and Capitol Cove. Final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) entered on December 6, 2010, from which plaintiff timely appealed. 8', 'The plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment is absent from the Superior Court file and was not submitted with the record on appeal.

However, plaintiff sought summary judgment against Capital Properties, Capitol Cove, and Liberty; the hearing justice granted the cross-motion of only Capital Properties and Capitol Cove. Because Liberty remains a defendant, the denial of plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is not a final judgment and is not properly before us on appeal.', '-5- counterclaim for setoff is separate from plaintiff’s claim against owner and lessee and that, because there is no setoff at issue on count 1, and plaintiff complied with the procedures necessary to assert a mechanics’ lien, it was error to grant judgment in favor of Capital Properties and Capitol Cove.', 'The defendant Capital Properties argues that a mechanics’ lien action is an action in rem and that the plain language of § 34-28-17 mandates the dismissal and discharge of the lien once a bond, which replaces the property as security for the claim, is deposited with the Registry of the Court.', '“The mechanics’ lien statute was designed to prevent unjust enrichment by one person at the expense of another.” Tilcon Gammino, Inc. v. Commercial Associates, 570 A.2d 1102, 1107 (R.I. 1990).

As a safeguard against erroneous deprivation of the owner or lessee’s property rights, “§ 34-28-17 allows the property owner to pay cash into or post a bond with the court registry to release the lien and regain clear title to the property.” Rossi, 867 A.2d at 813.', '-6-', 'Section 34-28-17(a) provides, in pertinent part:', '“At any time after the recording of a notice of intention or', 'after the filing of a complaint to enforce a lien under §§ 34-28-10', 'and 34-28-13, the owner or lessee or tenant of the land described in', 'the notice or complaint may pay into the registry of the court * * *', 'cash equal to the total amount of the notice of intention and the', 'accounts and demands of all persons claiming liens therein * * *', 'including costs, interest at the statutory rate and reasonable', 'attorney’s fees of the lien holder, or may, in lieu of cash, deposit in', 'the registry of the court the bond of a surety company licensed to', 'do business in this state in the total amount * * * and on proper', 'proof of payment or deposit and on motion of the owner or lessee', 'or tenant, any justice of the superior court shall enter ex parte an', 'order discharging the notice of intention and lis pendens and', 'dismissing the cause as to the owner or lessee or tenant * * * .” The hearing justice held that, while the lien law “is less than a masterpiece in clarity[,] * * * on some points it is clear, and that is [that] once the bond is posted, the persons whom the mechanics’ lien was filed against * * * go on with their business.

(quoting Mendes, 41 A.3d at 1002).', 'In our opinion, the plaintiff’s reliance on the word “include” is misplaced. Were it indicative of the presence of multiple parties, as plaintiff argues, surely that is consonant with situations in which a general contractor (like builder) remains a defendant, while the surety is included as an additional defendant. “The bond stands as security for any claim made by [plaintiff]; the real property is no longer at risk or encumbered in any way.” Keystone Elevator Co. v. Johnson & Wales University, 850 A.2d 912, 923 (R.I. 2004). To read § 34-28-17(b)(2) as permitting the inclusion of the owner and lessee as defendants after a bond is deposited would nullify § 34-28-17(a) which requires that an ex parte order shall enter “discharging the notice of intention and lis pendens and dismissing the cause as to the owner or lessee or tenant * * * .” We decline plaintiff’s invitation to construe this statute to reach such a paradoxical result.', 'Finally, we address the plaintiff’s contention that, because there is no setoff at issue on count 1, and the plaintiff complied with the procedures necessary to assert a mechanics’ lien, the', '-8- hearing justice erred in granting judgment to Capital Properties and Capitol Cove. It is true that owner and lessee did not counterclaim for setoff; but, at the same time, the plaintiff does not have a claim against owner or lessee.

We have previously stated that “[a] setoff * * * becomes part of a single controversy between the parties, requiring only one verdict and one judgment * * * .” Keystone Elevator Co., 850 A.2d at 919.

He stated: “At that point when [defendant was moved closer to the car], I said raise your head, look to the left, and that’s when he was positively identified.” 6', 'Although defendant’s testimony with respect to Anna’s identification of him was corroborated by the testimony of his stepsister, the state called as a rebuttal witness North Providence Police Officer Christopher Puleo, who had observed Anna’s identification of defendant at the latter’s residence on Morgan Avenue. Officer Puleo’s testimony was consistent with the testimony of both Anna and Det. DelSanto. He testified that Det.

He added that Mr. Justiniano was “maybe half an inch” taller than he and that, at the time of the alleged attack, both he and Mr. Justiniano wore their hair in the style which he characterized as a “Mohawk.” He further stated that, early on the morning of July 23, 2010, he had been wearing “dark jeans, pants [sic], dress shoes, [and a] purple dress shirt” and that Mr. Justiniano had been wearing a white dress shirt and jeans. However, he proceeded to testify that, by the time that Anna identified him in his driveway, he had changed and was then wearing a white shirt and jean shorts. The defendant has consistently contended that Anna mistakenly identified him rather than Mr. Justiniano as her attacker. On appeal, defendant argues that they resemble each other physically—specifically, with respect to their “age, distinctive hair style, hair color, race, height, and weight.” He also emphasizes that, when he was identified by Anna, he was wearing a white shirt, the same color shirt as Mr. Justiniano was wearing when defendant dropped him off at his home on the morning of July 23. driver’s seat of the police car. He stated that Det. DelSanto never exited the police car and that he did not see him whispering to Anna.

The defendant argued that the testimony of Anna, Det. DelSanto, Officer Puleo, and Cathy was contradictory. He also contended that the police department’s investigation of the incident was flawed in that the police had not fingerprinted the Taco Bell cup and had not conducted a side by side identification process. The defendant maintained that he was innocent and that, if anyone had attacked Anna, it was Mr. Justiniano. The trial justice ultimately denied defendant’s motion. In due course, defendant was sentenced to concurrent three year terms of imprisonment on each of the two counts on which he had been found guilty; the trial justice ordered that the sentences be suspended, with probation.', 'The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court.

The defendant submits that the evidence tended to establish that Mr. Justiniano was the “likely culprit,” and defendant asserts that what he considers to be Anna’s “misidentification” of him was caused by her consumption of alcohol and the similarity of his physical appearance to that of Mr. Justiniano.', ""When a trial justice considers a motion for a new trial, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

First, the trial justice considered the evidence presented at trial in light of the jury charge, giving special attention to the testimony of the complaining witness, Anna. The trial justice expressly acknowledged defendant’s contention that this was a case of mistaken identity, and he recognized that “the verdict turned on the jury’s assessment of the credibility of the complaining witness * * * [,] in particular, the reliability of her identification of Mr. Barrios as the person who assaulted her * * * .” In accordance with the second step in the process of analyzing a motion for a new trial, the trial justice then independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.

Bearing in mind the deferential standard of review that governs our scrutiny of a trial justice's findings and conclusions in this context, we are unable to rule that the trial justice in this close and credibility- intensive case was either clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence in his denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Clay, 79 A.3d at 842; State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 481 (R.I. 2010).

64,State : v. : Markus Matthews. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. On the night of May 6, 2009, three men savagely attacked and robbed Cesar Lopez (Lopez or complainant), who had unwittingly arrived at an abandoned house to deliver pizza. The attackers made off with about $20. Several days later, a chance encounter with one of the robbers led to his arrest, and that perpetrator implicated the defendant, Markus Matthews (defendant), in this brutal crime. The defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of a single count of first-degree robbery. He now appeals that conviction, assigning an array of errors to the trial court. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Cesar Lopez was employed by Domino’s Pizza (Domino’s) as a pizza delivery-person. On May 6, 2009, he drove to 54 Lynch Street in Providence to make a delivery. Upon arriving at that address, Lopez called the phone number associated with the order, and the voice on the other end told him to “go through the back door.” Although something about the situation appeared amiss, particularly because the house was dark, Lopez attempted to fulfill the delivery.', '-1-', 'As Lopez exited his vehicle, he was struck from behind with “a piece of tubing.”1 As a second attacker grabbed him, he heard someone say “bring him into the house.” While Lopez was being moved toward the house, there was one man in front, wearing a blue and white bandana over his nose, and another assailant behind him, with his arm around Lopez’s neck. When Lopez tried to turn around, the choke-hold tightened, almost to the point of strangulation. Lopez briefly was able to free himself, but was then struck on the leg with the pipe and dragged up the driveway toward the house.', 'As the attackers moved Lopez toward the house, the beating continued. According to Lopez, there were three assailants: one with the pipe and two men pummeling with their fists. Lopez testified that he was struck with the pipe on the head and left eye. Approximately $20 was taken from his pocket. As the attackers wrestled him toward the back door of the house, he was able to grab onto the handrail; the attackers repeatedly hit him in an effort to make him let go of the railing. At that point, Lopez fought back. The assailants grabbed his uniform shirt; he slipped out of it and escaped to his car. The assailants were left holding the shirt. After Lopez reached the street, the attackers retreated and, despite his injuries—one eye was completely closed—he was able to drive back to Domino’s. When he arrived, he sounded the horn, exited the car, and collapsed. Lopez’s co-workers helped him up and called 911. Lopez continues to have problems with his eyesight and suffers from headaches.', 'On May 10, 2009, Lopez visited Domino’s in order to return some items belonging to the store, including his uniform and pizza bag. While driving there with his wife, Lopez saw one of his attackers who was loitering on the street. According to Lopez, when the attacker saw him, he “started doing some suspicious things,” such as backing up so that Lopez could not see him. 1', 'It appears from the testimony that the “tubing” was a metal pipe.', '-2- After his wife called the police, they decided to circle the block; when the alleged attacker saw the car again, he went into a driveway and came out onto another street. Lopez directed his wife to drive to another street, where he expected the attacker to appear. Upon seeing Lopez again, the assailant started running with Lopez in pursuit.', 'After a foot chase, Lopez caught the attacker—Michael Long—and held him until the police arrived.', 'The police arrested Long for the May 6, 2009 robbery and proceeded to interview him. Long initially denied any involvement in the crime, but eventually confessed, and in so doing, he implicated defendant.2 Based on statements made by Long, defendant was apprehended. Long later pled nolo contendere to charges of robbery and conspiracy to rob.', 'At trial in this case, the complainant testified about the attack, noting that he could not recall the exact time that he left to deliver the pizza, but that it was after 10 p.m.3 He also testified about the circumstances that led to Long’s arrest. The state also called Long to testify; however, he professed to have no memory of the events, notwithstanding his confession and subsequent plea. Jeannine Labossiere, Michael Long’s former fiancée and the mother of his child, also testified at trial, and her memory was intact. She testified that, at about 10:30 p.m. on May 6, 2009, Long borrowed her cell phone and left her apartment. Labossiere testified that he was gone until about 1 a.m. when he returned to her house, accompanied by defendant. She testified that after some prodding, Long disclosed the beating and robbery of a Domino’s delivery-person, as defendant stood silent. The defendant neither contested nor denied Long’s recital of the events of the evening. Labossiere also testified that her cell phone number matched 2', 'Long implicated defendant in both versions that he gave to police, including when he denied his own involvement. Long also implicated a third man referred to as “Knowledge” in his recorded statement. 3', 'The owner of the Domino’s Pizza testified that his establishment’s tracking system indicated that the call came in at 11:17 p.m.', '-3- the one used to call Domino’s on May 6, 2009. Because the testimony of both Long and Labossiere are central to the issues in this case, we elaborate upon their testimony in the discussion below.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense and denied any involvement in this crime. He claimed that he was not at 54 Lynch Street on the night of May 6, 2009, having left Labossiere’s house at about 9:30 p.m., arriving home a little after 10 p.m. The defendant’s mother also testified, corroborating her son’s alibi. The jury was unconvinced.', 'The trial justice instructed the jury that they were to consider three charges against defendant. The trial justice told the jury that defendant was charged with first-degree robbery, but that it was alleged to have been committed under two different theories: “The first theory is that [defendant did] rob Cesar Lopez by use of a dangerous weapon. The second, or alternative, theory is he did rob Cesar Lopez and Cesar Lopez was, in fact, injured.” Later, the trial justice told the jury,', '“There’s only one robbery being charged but two factual elements', 'that are different from each count. One is the dangerous weapon;', 'one is the injury. You make separate decisions for each one. But', 'they clearly are one count, one charge of the robbery. He’s not', 'being charged with two separate counts of robbery.” Additionally, defendant was charged with conspiracy to rob.', 'The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on first-degree robbery by means of a dangerous weapon and the conspiracy count. The defendant, however, was found guilty of first-degree robbery resulting in injury. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial justice, who subsequently sentenced defendant to twenty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with nine years to serve and the remaining eleven years suspended with probation.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'I', 'Double Jeopardy', 'Count 1 of the indictment charged that defendant “on or about 6th day of May, 2009, in the City of Providence, in the County of Providence, did rob Ceasar Lopez by use of a dangerous weapon * * * .” Similarly, count 2 of the indictment charged that defendant “on or about 6th day of May, 2009, in the City of Providence, in the County of Providence, did rob Ceasar Lopez causing him to be injured * * * .” The defendant argues that his conviction for first-degree robbery must be vacated because “[c]harging one robbery as two crimes and permitting the jury to deliberate twice on one robbery violated double jeopardy principles.”', 'Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” (Emphasis added.) “[A] defendant’s failure to raise such a motion before trial precludes that defendant from thereafter raising a double jeopardy challenge.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007) (citing State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 647 (R.I. 2006)). In this case, defendant did not comply with the provisions of Rule 12(b)(2) and, therefore, has waived this argument.', 'Nonetheless, we deem it appropriate to address two important issues. First, were this issue properly before the Court, we would affirm defendant’s conviction because we are satisfied that defendant’s double jeopardy contentions are without merit. The principal evil against which the Double Jeopardy Clause protects—multiple criminal punishments for the same offense—is not implicated in this case because defendant stands convicted of (and punished for) a single offense. See Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997) (“The [Double Jeopardy] Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense', '-5- * * * .”) (emphasis omitted); see also 1A Charles Alan Wright & Andrew D. Leipold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal § 142 at 11-12 (4th ed. 2008) (“It remains permissible to charge a single offense in several counts (although not to convict and punish on more than one for a single crime) * * *.”). Additionally, this Court has noted that “it would be impermissible to charge a defendant with murder in the second degree and, subsequent to disposition of the charge, then charge him or her with first-degree murder,” but that “[t]rial of lesser-included offenses contemporaneously with the trial for the greater offense does not violate principles of double jeopardy.” State v. Grabowski, 644 A.2d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 1994). Although the two separate factual predicates for first-degree robbery here do not constitute a primary and a lesser- included offense, the same principle nonetheless applies because they are alternative theories of guilt. Furthermore, the trial justice’s instruction to the jury mollified the risk that the indictment would result in unconstitutional multiple punishment. The trial justice instructed the jury that the indictment alleged two different theories of robbery, and, later in the instruction, she stated that the two robbery charges “clearly are one count, one charge of robbery. He’s not being charged with two separate counts of robbery.”', 'The defendant argues that in accordance with our decision in State v. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d 907 (R.I. 2004), this Court must vacate defendant’s conviction. We agree that the issues presented in Bolarinho are similar, but we disagree that our holding compels the remedy sought by defendant. In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09, the defendant was convicted of two offenses— felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury and felony assault by means of a dangerous weapon, a shod foot. It was clear, however, that both crimes arose from the same assault. Id. at 911. This error was remedied by our decision that vacated the conviction on count 1—assault resulting in serious bodily injury. Id. We did not vacate both convictions and order a new trial.', '-6- See id. Here, defendant contends that the Bolarinho remedy cannot be invoked because the jury found him not guilty on count 1; and that, therefore, the Court must vacate the conviction and order a new trial because defendant “cannot be both innocent and guilty of the same crime.” We reject this argument. In this case, defendant was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the offense of first-degree robbery that resulted in injury. The jury was not satisfied that the state had proven robbery by means of a dangerous weapon. Simply because the jury rejected this theory of robbery, that fact does not impact the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because there was a single conviction in this case, there is no double jeopardy violation for us to remedy. See id. Additionally, we are not confronted with inconsistent verdicts. Because the prosecution had two theories of robbery, the jury could have concluded that both theories were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, or that defendant robbed Lopez causing bodily injury, but the state did not prove that defendant used a dangerous weapon in the process. Nevertheless, a conviction of a single count of first-degree robbery would result.', 'Second, we provide guidance to the trial court and its practitioners in order to avoid confusion when a single offense is charged under multiple theories. Initially, we note that a bill of particulars is designed to cure any potential problems with the indictment in the early stage of a prosecution; however, defendant did not file for a bill of particulars in this case. Contrast Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 194 (R.I. 2008) (“The record discloses that a bill of particulars was filed in this case that made clear that a single act was charged in each of the seven counts.”). Furthermore, although a permissible practice, charging defendant with two separate counts of first-degree robbery is not the ideal manner in which to draft an indictment. The preferable manner is to charge a single offense as one count, setting forth multiple theories that may be alleged. See Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 66 n.20 (1978) (“A single offense should', '-7- normally be charged in one count rather than several, even if different means of committing the offense are alleged.”).', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-12-1.4 provides in pertinent part, “An indictment, information, or complaint shall be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the offense charged.” Nothing in this section precludes the assertion of multiple theories in a single count. Additionally, Rule 7(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure permits such a procedure: “It may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that he [or she] committed it by one or more specified means.” (Emphasis added.) Although it may be constitutionally permissible to charge a single offense in several counts, we reiterate that “the rules are intended to discourage that practice.” Wright and Leipold, § 142 at 12 (discussing identical federal rule). As the Eighth Circuit recently stated:', '“[W]here a ‘statute specifies two or more ways in which one', 'offense may be committed, all may be alleged in the conjunctive in', 'one count of the indictment, and proof of any one of the methods', 'will sustain a conviction.’ * * * This method of procedure would', 'adequately inform the defendant of each allegation that he must', 'defend against while solving any potential multiplicity problems.”', 'United States v. Roy, 408 F.3d 484, 492 n.4 (8th Cir. 2005)', '(quoting Gerberding v. United States, 471 F.2d 55, 59 (8th Cir.', '1973) (emphasis added)). Ultimately, when confronted with a single offense in an indictment from which a jury could conclude that the offense was committed under one or more theories, it is the trial justice’s responsibility—through instructions to the jury and a carefully drafted verdict form—to ensure that a defendant stands convicted, if at all, of a single offense.', 'An indictment or criminal information that charges one offense having been committed by multiple means is a fair solution for both the state and the defendant. It lessens, or eliminates, any potential double jeopardy concerns, because it ensures that the accused is charged with a single offense, and thus, can only be convicted and sentenced on a single count. It also addresses', '-8- duplicity issues because the jury would have to state which theory or theories were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.4 Requiring a jury to deliberate on each factual predicate alleged in the charging document is also fair to the state because it permits the jury to find that the state proved multiple theories, but only one offense—a practice that permits a complete examination of the sufficiency of the evidence in the event that there is a motion for a new trial.', 'II', 'Admission of Michael Long’s Recorded Statement', 'The defendant wages a multi-pronged attack against the use at trial of Michael Long’s statement to police following his arrest. As noted, when he testified during the state’s case-in- chief, Long suffered from the ubiquitous failure of memory of a confessing codefendant. Long admitted that he participated in the robbery of a pizza delivery-person on May 6, 2009, and that he was serving a sentence at the Adult Correctional Institutions for that crime. However, he claimed to remember almost nothing else about that night or his arrest on May 10, 2009. The prosecutor attempted to refresh Long’s recollection by showing him the statement that he gave to police after he was arrested; this proved futile because Long repeatedly denied that his recollection was refreshed. Long not only professed a failure of memory about the statement, he refused to acknowledge his own voice on the tape recording. When confronted with defendant’s photograph—the one he identified when he was arrested—Long recognized defendant as the person in the photograph; however, he denied that it was his signature below the picture, despite acknowledging that the name looked like “Michael Long” and the date was “5/10/09.” When the 4', '“The term ‘duplicity’ refers to the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a single count of an indictment.” State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998). The problem with duplicity is that “a guilty verdict on a duplicitous indictment does not indicate whether the jury found defendant guilty without having reached [a] unanimous verdict on the commission of a particular offense.” Id. (quoting United States v. Murray, 618 F.2d 892, 896 (2d Cir. 1980)).', '-9- prosecutor asked Long whether he remembered the interrogation at the Providence police station, Long responded, “I don’t know what happened five minutes ago.”', 'In the face of Long’s recalcitrance and refusal to acknowledge that his recollection was refreshed in any way, the prosecutor began asking specific leading questions about Long’s statement to police. At this point, defense counsel raised an objection to “the further continuance of [the prosecutor’s] line of questioning” and argued at sidebar that Long’s statements did not qualify as prior inconsistent statements. The trial justice, however, analogized this case to two prior opinions of this Court5 and stated, “I think that I am going to make a finding that at the appropriate time it’s a prior inconsistent statement.”6 The prosecutor continued asking specific leading questions after Long continued to claim that his recollection had not been refreshed. These questions included statements by Long that he punched the complainant and that defendant hit him with a lead pipe. Later, during the testimony of a Providence police detective, the recording of the interview was admitted as a full exhibit and played for the jury.7', 'The defendant raises issues under the Rules of Evidence, the Confrontation Clause, and the Due Process Clause. His primary argument is that Long’s statements were inadmissible hearsay and violative of the Confrontation Clause. Although defendant contends that “[t]he arguments against admissibility are the same under [Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence] and the Confrontation Clause,” such is not the case. See Crawford v. 5', 'We discuss these cases below; they are State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229 (R.I. 2010) and State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984 (R.I. 2004). 6', 'Although the trial justice stated this in the future tense, it appears that counsel took this as the trial justice’s definitive ruling. 7', 'When the state moved for admission, defense counsel objected and noted the previous sidebars. The court asked whether defense counsel wanted further argument, but defense counsel declined. The trial justice then stated, “Same ruling. May be marked.” Transcripts of the recording were provided as aids for the jury, but the transcripts were not admitted as full exhibits.', '- 10 - Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 61 (2004) (“Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment’s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of ‘reliability.’”). Therefore, we will consider these arguments separately.', 'A', 'Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(A)', '“The applicable standard of review of a trial justice’s admission of evidence is a clear abuse of discretion.” State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1234 (R.I. 2010). Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides: “A statement is not hearsay if * * * [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony * * *.” The trial justice allowed examination based on Long’s prior statements and admitted the recording of his statement under this rule. We conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in doing so.', 'We have addressed nearly identical situations in two previous opinions. In State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 986 (R.I. 2004), a key witness “suffered a convenient failure of memory, declaring over and over again, especially at critical points about details of [a] drive-by shooting, that he had difficulty remembering the events of [the evening of the shooting].” At trial, the state introduced portions of the witness’s police statement, and, on appeal, the defendant argued that the statement should not have been admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 986, 987. This Court concluded that “the provisions of Rule 801(d)(1)(A) have been satisfied and that [the witness] was subject to cross-examination within the meaning of the rule.” Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 990. In McManus, 990 A.2d at 1232, a witness who had been approached by the defendant to engage in a murder for hire scheme “professed a total failure of memory about', '- 11 - everything concerning the incident, including his discussions with the state police.”', 'The prosecutor questioned the witness as an adverse witness and used leading questions over defense counsel’s continuing objection.', 'Id.', 'We held that the introduction of the witness’s police statement was proper under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). McManus, 990 A.2d at 1236. Permitting this kind of examination in the face of a witness’s convenient failure of memory is consistent with a prominent treatise on the law of evidence:', '“Where a witness no longer remembers an event, a prior statement', 'describing that event should not be considered inconsistent. Yet', 'the tendency of unwilling or untruthful witnesses to seek refuge in', 'a claim of forgetfulness is well recognized. Hence the judge may', 'be warranted in concluding under the circumstances the claimed', 'lack of memory of the event is untrue and in effect an implied', 'denial of the prior statement, thus qualifying it as inconsistent.', 'The case law readily accepts this position.” 2 McCormick on', 'Evidence, § 251 at 214 (7th ed. 2013).', 'We discern no difference between this case and our prior holdings in Jaiman and McManus. Here, Long similarly professed a lack of memory regarding almost all of the facts salient to the robbery and his subsequent arrest, including his own signature and the sound of his voice. Thus, it was permissible for the prosecutor to question him about the details of his statement to police in an attempt to refresh his recollection and for the trial justice to admit the recording. It was for the jury to determine whether Long’s refusal to admit his recollection was refreshed was in fact a denial of the prior statement and therefore, a prior inconsistent statement of a testifying witness. Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion by admitting the statements under Rule 801(d)(1)(A).', 'B', 'Confrontation Clause', 'This Court reviews issues of constitutional dimension on a de novo basis. State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 308 (R.I. 2008) (“This Court undertakes a de novo review of questions', '- 12 - of law, as well as mixed questions of law and fact, that involve issues of constitutional dimension.”). The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * * *.” Although not articulated with perfect clarity, defendant’s Confrontation Clause argument seems to suggest that, despite his physical presence on the witness stand, Long was unavailable for cross-examination because of his professed lack of memory.', 'The seminal case in modern Confrontation Clause jurisprudence is Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).', 'In Crawford, the Supreme Court recognized that the Confrontation Clause provides a procedural, rather than substantive, guarantee that evidence be tested by cross-examination:', '“[T]he [Confrontation] Clause’s ultimate goal is to ensure', 'reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a', 'substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable,', 'but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in', 'the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a', 'judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a', 'point on which there could be little dissent), but about how', 'reliability can best be determined.” Id. at 61. Nevertheless, Crawford also declared, “[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.” Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60 n.9. In this case, the declarant—Long—appeared at trial and was subject to cross-examination, including cross-examination with the contents of his prior statement. Additionally, defense counsel questioned Long about his plea deal, his arrest, and a possible love affair between defendant and Labossiere.', 'The defendant relies upon two United States Supreme Court cases for his Confrontation Clause argument. In Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 416 (1965), the witness called to testify was a previously convicted codefendant who invoked his privilege against self-incrimination', '- 13 - when he took the stand. After the judge ordered the witness to answer and he again refused, the prosecutor read from a document purporting to be a signed confession by the witness and, every few sentences, asked the witness whether he made the statement. Id. The witness continued to assert the privilege and to refuse to answer. Id. at 416-17. The Supreme Court held that the defendant’s inability to cross-examine the witness regarding the confession denied the defendant his right of cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 419. Here, Long did not refuse to testify based on any Fifth Amendment privilege; rather, he testified that he had no memory about the statement but was, in fact, available for cross-examination. Although his responses were not particularly helpful, they were substantive in that he stated that he did not remember making the statement and did not recognize the sound of his own voice or his signature; Long did not deny making the statement to police. Further, on cross-examination, defense counsel asked a number of questions about the circumstances surrounding Long’s statement, and Long answered those questions.8', 'Thus, we cannot say that Long was not available for cross-examination as is a witness who claims a privilege against self-incrimination and refuses to answer any questions at all.', 'The defendant also cites Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530 (1986), to support his Confrontation Clause argument. Because the reasoning of Lee is fundamentally at odds with the reasoning of Crawford, its continued viability is dubious. Compare Crawford, 541 U.S. at 63 (rejecting an “indicia of reliability” framework as “so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from even core confrontation violations”) with Lee, 476 U.S. at 539 8', 'For example, when shown the rights form that he signed, Long acknowledged that he signed the form at 6:12 p.m.; when shown the transcript of the recorded statement, Long acknowledged that it did not start until 6:52 p.m. Defense counsel then asked a number of questions about what happened in the time between the signing of the rights form and the start of the recording. Long responded that he did not remember having a conversation with the police officers before they turned the recorder on, but that they “said something about the robbery.”', '- 14 - (holding that the witness’s statement was “presumptively unreliable and that it did not bear sufficient independent ‘indicia of reliability’ to overcome that presumption”); see also State v. Moten, 64 A.3d 1232, 1240 (R.I. 2013) (noting that Crawford definitively abrogated the “indicia of reliability” framework as announced in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980)). Regardless of the legal reasoning, the facts of Lee are inapplicable here because the confessing codefendant witness in Lee never took the stand. See Lee, 476 U.S. at 536.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the use of Long’s prior police statements as prior inconsistent statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60 n.9; see also Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 989 (“[T]he Confrontation Clause ‘guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.’”).', 'C', 'Remaining Arguments', 'The defendant also contends that the leading questions that the prosecutor was permitted to ask Long were prejudicial. When reviewing leading questions posed to another witness suffering from jailhouse amnesia, this Court declared,', '“Although leading questions generally are prohibited on direct', 'examination, they may be allowed for a limited purpose such as to', 'guide the testimony of a hostile or a purportedly forgetful witness.', '“Here, it is clear that [the witness’s] appearance at trial was', 'anything but cooperative; he experienced a failure of memory that', 'could be characterized as hostile and lacking in credibility. A', 'party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an', 'effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner', 'may resort to leading questions. It is within the discretion of the', 'trial justice to decide whether to allow the examiner to lead; that', 'discretion, however, is not without limit.” McManus, 990 A.2d at', '1236.', '- 15 - Although in McManus, the trial justice came “dangerously close to a prejudicial abuse of discretion,” we deemed any error to have been harmless “in light of our decision upholding the introduction of [the witness’s] statement to the police.” Id. In this case, we are of the opinion that error, if any, arising from the use of leading questions by the state was harmless based on our conclusion that Long’s police statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. This holding simply recognizes the difficulty inherent in attempting to refresh the recollection of an unwilling witness without resort to leading questions. This is a decision left to the discretion of the trial justice.', 'The defendant also argued that his due process rights were violated because Long’s statement was obtained without counsel and was the product of coercion.', 'This argument, however, was not raised to the trial justice below. Therefore, it was waived. See State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”).', 'III', 'Admission of Jeannine Labossiere’s Testimony as an Adoptive Admission', 'The defendant argues that Long’s statements to Labossiere should not have been admitted as adoptive admissions by defendant. At trial, Labossiere testified that Long and defendant came to her house at 1 a.m. on May 7, 2009. She noticed that defendant was limping and that Long had a bandana wrapped around his hand; thus, she sensed that something was amiss. After she repeatedly asked them what happened, Long admitted that “they robbed a Domino delivery guy.” According to Labossiere, defendant “looked a little mad that Long said something” to her, but he remained silent. Long then provided additional details about the crime, including that he gave Labossiere’s cell phone to defendant so that defendant could call Domino’s and place an order', '- 16 - for delivery to an abandoned house. Long disclosed that, when Lopez approached the house, defendant grabbed him and put him in a choke-hold. At that point, it was defendant who demonstrated the choke-hold to Labossiere. She also testified that Long described Lopez as badly beaten and that he got away a couple of times such that defendant had to put him back in the choke-hold. Shocked at these revelations, Labossiere said to them, “What the hell did you guys do?” She testified that defendant responded, “We just told you what we did.” (Emphasis added.) When she inquired about the fruits of the robbery, defendant told Labossiere that he bought her a pack of cigarettes and produced about $15 in cash.', 'A trial justice’s evidentiary rulings are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. McManus, 990 A.2d at 1234. Rule 801(d)(2)(B) provides that “[a] statement is not hearsay if * * *[t]he statement is offered against a party and is * * * a statement of which the party has manifested his or her adoption or belief in its truth[.]”', 'It is well settled that “silence is sometimes sufficient to signify adoption.”', 'Day, 925 A.2d at 983.', 'Where an accusatory statement was made within hearing distance of an accused and the accused did not respond to the accusation, this Court has pointed to five factors to consider in deciding whether a purported adoptive admission results:', '“(1) whether the statement was incriminating or accusatory; (2)', 'whether it was one to which an innocent person in the defendant’s', 'situation would respond; (3) whether the statement was made', 'within the presence and hearing range of the defendant; (4)', 'whether it was understood by the defendant; and (5) whether the', 'statement was one to which the defendant had an opportunity to', 'respond.” Id.', 'We are satisfied that this case represents a use of classic adoptive admissions. Long implicated defendant in a robbery; thus, the statement was clearly incriminating. Furthermore, an innocent person would certainly respond to such a direct suggestion of robbery. Labossiere also testified that Long and defendant were standing side-by-side—clearly within hearing range.', '- 17 - The fact that defendant looked annoyed by Long’s initial disclosure of the robbery and later demonstrated the choke-hold he applied to subdue Lopez establish that he not only understood the statements, but that he also had an opportunity to respond; additionally, evidence that defendant demonstrated the choke-hold is an admission by conduct. If defendant’s silence during Long’s initial disclosure was not enough to establish an adoptive admission, defendant later affirmed his participation in the robbery by telling Labossiere, “[w]e just told you what we did.” Accordingly, the trial justice did not err by admitting Long’s statements to Labossiere in the presence of defendant as adoptive admissions.', 'IV', 'Denial of Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial. “When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict must he or she consider whether reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome. State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 310 (R.I. 2012). “[W]hen ‘the trial justice has articulated a sufficient rationale for denying a motion for a new trial, the decision will be given great weight’', '- 18 - and we will disturb it only if the trial justice ‘has overlooked or misconceived material evidence relating to a critical issue or if the justice was otherwise clearly wrong.’” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 365 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994)).', 'In this case, the trial justice thoroughly recounted the evidence witness-by-witness. She made credibility determinations as to the key witnesses; specifically, she found that Lopez and Labossiere were credible and that the defendant, his mother, and Long were not credible witnesses. Ultimately, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict and denied the motion for a new trial. Primarily, the defendant seizes upon the trial justice’s apparent misstatement that it was the defendant who told Labossiere that he and Long had robbed a Domino’s delivery- person. While the defendant is correct—the record discloses that it was Long who made the disclosure—this error is immaterial to the decision denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. Although the defendant did not directly declare, “we robbed a Domino’s delivery guy,” his silence and demonstrative conduct permit the factfinder to draw an inference that the defendant adopted that statement. Furthermore, as noted by the trial justice, the defendant demonstrated his choke-hold for Labossiere and also responded to her question by saying, “We just told you what we did.” Therefore, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence relating to a critical issue in this case. Accordingly, she did not err by denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the conviction.

After completing his work shift at Vac-Forming in Central Falls, Jorge Restrepo began the short walk to his home on Watson Street. Tragically, before he reached his home, Restrepo was accosted, robbed, and viciously beaten to death by two assailants. In the densely populated neighborhood, several people witnessed the incident.', 'Diego Rodriguez testified that he was visiting a family member on Watson Street at about 5 p.m. on August 4.

Rodriguez testified that, after stepping outside, he heard a man screaming for help. Rodriguez then observed a man on the ground; he saw one of the two youths, whom he had seen earlier, strike the man in the face and attempt to remove what was in his pockets. Rodriguez described one of the assailants as taller than the other and testified that the taller man had kicked Restrepo in the head “like if he was a football.” After Rodriguez yelled at the two men to stop, one of them turned to look at him. Rodriguez then moved towards the fracas to help the victim and got a second look at the same assailant. Rodriguez said he observed the taller of the two more closely and said that that person had braids in his hair and was wearing a white T-shirt with black shorts. Rodriguez also testified that just before the pair fled the scene, he saw the taller one remove a red firearm from his waistband.', 'Manuel Coelho said that he arrived on Watson Street in his red pickup truck at about 5:30 p.m. He also observed two men kicking and hitting Restrepo. He then saw the two rip Restrepo’s pants and steal his wallet. Coelho said that the events unfolded very quickly, but he was able to describe the two men as skinny, having dark skin, and between eighteen and twenty years of age. He also testified that both men were about 5’6” or 5’7” and could describe the clothing of only one of the two, saying that that assailant was wearing jeans and a red top. On cross-examination, Coelho testified that he did not recognize defendant as one of the men who attacked Restrepo.', 'At around the same time, James Major, Restrepo’s supervisor at Vac-Forming Unlimited drove his normal after-work route along Watson Street. Major testified that he pulled up behind a red pickup truck that was stopped in the lane of travel. Major indicated that he observed two', '-3- black men emerge from the front of the pickup truck and that one of them was carrying a red gun in his right hand. Major testified that his attention was focused on the red gun, and, as a result, he could not positively identify either of the men. He was, however, able to describe both men as black, between nineteen and twenty years old, and also that the one carrying the firearm was wearing a red do-rag. 3', 'Central Falls police officer Patrick Rogan was dispatched to Watson Street for a report of a man down. At approximately 5:37 p.m., Officer Rogan arrived on Watson Street where a group from the neighborhood was already starting to crowd the street. When he got out of his cruiser, Rogan saw Restrepo lying on his back on the street, apparently unconscious. He noticed that Restrepo’s eyes were slightly open, that he was breathing slowly, and that he had urinated on himself. Within a minute of Rogan’s arrival, emergency rescue personnel arrived, began to stabilize Restrepo, and placed him in the rescue vehicle. Rogan accompanied Restrepo to Memorial Hospital. 4 After initial treatment at that hospital, Restrepo was transferred to Rhode Island Hospital because of the serious nature of the trauma he had experienced. Unfortunately, however, and despite all efforts to save him, Restrepo was pronounced dead at Rhode Island Hospital at 11:05 p.m.', 'Lieutenant Steven Bradley, along with other responding police officers from Central Falls, transported Rodriguez, Coelho, and Major, along with a number of other potential witnesses to the police station in an effort to obtain more detailed information and formal statements from them.

A photograph of defendant was not included in either of the photo arrays that Rodriguez reviewed on August 4 or August 5, 2008.', 'On August 6, 2008, two days after the savage attack on Restrepo, two Providence police officers observed a white Acura containing two occupants traveling on North Main Street in Providence at approximately forty to forty-five miles per hour in a twenty-five-mile-per-hour zone. The officers activated the police cruiser’s sirens and lights and followed the Acura. Approximately ten blocks later, the driver finally pulled over. But, after the officers exited their vehicle and began to approach the Acura, the driver suddenly drove away at a high rate of speed. A chase ensued through Providence at speeds approaching 100 miles per hour until the vehicle became disabled on the Branch Avenue overpass above Interstate 95. The two occupants then fled the car on foot. One of the officers observed the passenger of the vehicle holding a handgun in his right hand as he fled. Both suspects, one of whom was defendant and the other his brother, Keishon, soon were apprehended. Shortly thereafter, police located a red Cobra handgun in the bushes along the embankment. Police later identified defendant as the driver of the Acura.', 'Central Falls police became aware of the car chase in Providence, and that department secured a photo array, which included defendant, from Providence police to show to Rodriguez.

He stated that in his sixteen-year career at the BCI, and, after examining hundreds of firearms, he had never seen a pistol similar in color to the one seized after the August 6 incident. Sergeant Christopher Reed of the Central Falls police department testified that, in his eleven-year career as an armorer, weapons instructor, and handler of hundreds of weapons, he also had never seen a handgun of this color. Finally, Lt. Steven Bradley, who had served in a variety of positions in his fifteen years with the Central Falls police department, testified that he never had encountered a firearm that had the same or similar color as the one seized after the car chase.', 'After the state’s case concluded, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on count 7 (using a firearm to commit a crime of violence) and count 8 (carrying a pistol without a license), motions that the trial justice granted. The defendant then called three witnesses to present an alibi for his whereabouts on August 4, 2008. The first, Bernice Brown, testified that defendant and his girlfriend stayed with her for a few weeks during the month of August, 2008. She stated that she unexpectedly had to take a trip to Virginia on August 3, which was also her son’s birthday, and she left her four children in the care of defendant and his girlfriend. Brown said that she returned on August 5, and, on August 6, she loaned her white Acura to defendant and his', '-6- brother Keishon. Bernice Brown’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Aaliyah Robinson, testified that on August 4, Robinson, her siblings, defendant, and his girlfriend went to Scarborough Beach, arriving around noon and remaining until dusk. Robinson testified that, upon returning from the beach, defendant remained at her home for the rest of the evening watching movies. On cross- examination, Robinson admitted that she had not told the police or anyone outside her family about the beach excursion until asked about it by defense counsel. Craig Robinson, Bernice Brown’s son, whose tenth birthday was August 3, also testified about the trip to the beach on August 4.

Pursuant to Article I, Rule 4(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, a notice of appeal filed before entry of judgment is “treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof.”', '-7- Next, defendant argues that even if joinder had been proper under Rule 8(a), the trial justice nonetheless erred by not granting defendant’s motion to sever the remaining August 4 offenses (counts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7) from the August 8 offenses (counts 8 and 9) under Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Third, Brown claims that the trial justice impacted defendant’s right to a fair trial when he refused to allow a police artist’s sketch into evidence. Fourth, defendant maintains that the trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s motion to exclude three autopsy photographs from evidence. Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We will address each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Rule 8(a) Joinder', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the charges stemming from the August 4 and August 6 incidents were improperly joined because they were based on two entirely different series of events that had no similarity of character, plan, or purpose. The indictment charged defendant with ten counts. Prior to trial on October 25, 2010, defendant filed a motion to sever the offenses that related to the murder occurring on August 4, 2008, from those linked to the police chase on', '6 August 6, 2008.', 'The trial justice denied the motion, ruling that there was a “clear nexus” between the alleged possession of the firearm on August 6 and the robbery/murder on August 4. The trial justice also noted that the unusual nature of the red firearm served as the link between the two incidents. 6', 'By the time that the trial justice heard defendant’s motion to sever, counts 2, 6, and 10 had been dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-8-', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“[W]hen confronted with questions of law on appeal, this Court undertakes a de novo review.” State v.

In deciding whether joinder is proper, Rule 8(a) is to be interpreted broadly to enhance judicial efficiency. See United States v. Berg, 714 F.3d 490, 494 (7th Cir. 2013). 7 Rule 8(a) is “generously construed in favor of joinder, * * * in part because [Rule 14] provides a separate layer of protection where it is most needed.” United States v.

Day, 898 A.2d 698, 704 (R.I. 2006).', 'We have not as of yet encountered a joinder case with the same set of somewhat unusual procedural circumstances as are present here. The indictment charged defendant with ten counts; however, we must consider in our analysis that count 2 (conspiracy to commit murder), count 6 (carrying a dangerous weapon while committing a crime of violence), and count 10 (driving on a suspended license) were dismissed via Rule 48(a) prior to trial. Also, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 7 (using a firearm to commit a crime of violence) and 8 (carrying a pistol without a license) at the conclusion of the state’s case. The remaining five counts included four charges stemming from August 4 (murder, robbery, conspiracy, carrying a firearm without a license), while the lone surviving count from the August 6 incident was count 9 (reckless driving). In its opposition to the Rule 8 motion, the state argued before the trial justice that the red gun was the common element between the two offenses and that it was essential evidence. The state contended that the red gun was the single piece of evidence that led to the identification of defendant in the murder investigation and that it provided probable cause to arrest Brown. Admittedly, at first blush, counts 1, 3, 4, and 5 do not appear to be of a sufficiently similar character with count 9 to make joinder proper under Rule 8(a). In our opinion, however, determination of this issue requires us to define the point in time that is critical to a Rule 8 analysis. 8', 'Rule 8(a) states that “[t]wo (2) or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two (2) or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.”', '- 10 -', 'When the language of a rule is clear and unambiguous, this Court must give the words of the rule their plain and ordinary meanings. See Golderese v. Suburban Land Co., 590 A.2d 395, 397 (R.I. 1991). Rule 8(a) states that “[t]wo (2) or more offenses” may be included in the “same indictment” if those offenses meet any of the above three scenarios. Although this discrete issue has not been previously addressed by this Court, questions of joinder under Rule 8(a) in several circuit courts of appeal examine only the propriety of the indictment itself. See, e.g., Berg, 714 F.3d at 495 (“Further in assessing whether joinder was proper, we look solely to the face of the indictment and not to the evidence adduced later at trial.” (quoting United States v. Lanas, 324 F.3d 894, 899 (7th Cir. 2003))); United States v. Locklear, 631 F.3d 364, 368 (6th Cir. 2011) (“Whether joinder was proper under Rule 8(a) is determined by the allegations on the face of the indictment.” (quoting United States v. Chavis, 296 F.3d 450, 456 (6th Cir. 2002))); United States v. Jawara, 474 F.3d 565, 578 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he bottom line is that the similar character of the joined offenses should be ascertainable—either readily apparent or reasonably inferred— from the face of the indictment.”). We agree in principle with this approach and will look to the charges and allegations that are contained in the indictment, perhaps supplemented by a bill of particulars, and not only to those offenses that the jury considered, to determine if joinder under Rule 8(a) was proper.', 'To analyze whether joinder was proper as a “same or similar character” offense, “we examine the base offenses charged, the location and time of the offenses, whether the offenses occurred within a close time span, the similarity of the victims, and the modus operandi of the offenses.” 9 Pereira, 973 A.2d at 25. Although the two events in this case did occur within forty- eight hours of each other, they did not occur in the same location, there was no similarity of 9', 'In State v. Pereira, 973 A.2d 19, 26 (R.I. 2009), we cautioned that this Court had never held that “the passage of time, standing alone, is determinative of the issue of joinder.”', '- 11 - victims, and there was no discernible modus operandi. However, the “base offenses” charged share not only similarity, but counts 5 and 8 are precisely the same: carrying a pistol without a license.', 'Viewing this case through that lens, and mindful that the law favors joinder, we are convinced that joinder was proper pursuant to two of the considerations under a Rule 8(a) analysis:', '“same or similar character” and “two * * * or more * * * transactions connected together.”', 'On appeal, defendant renews the argument that he pressed before the trial justice, that none of the scenarios for Rule 8(a) joinder is present here. The state counters that joinder is proper under a “same or similar character” analysis, which is the same rationale that the trial justice relied upon when he denied defendant’s motion to sever under Rule 8(a). He reasoned:', '“With respect to Rule 8 joinder, our Supreme Court has', 'spoken obviously on many occasions as to the test on joinder. I', 'would more recently look at the Day case, 898 A.2d 698 (2006).', 'There was a consolidation of two indictments of robbery, one of', 'which included a gun; one did not. The Court indicated, ‘[w]e', 'repeatedly have held that offenses of varying degrees of similarity', 'are sufficiently “of the same or similar character.”’ It cited the', 'Hernandez case with a parenthetical, ‘(marshaling [sic] the fact', 'that four charges were all “of an assaultive nature” and that “the', 'fifth offense, unlawful possession of a firearm, is attributed to the', 'tool used to perpetrate the violence.”).’ That’s precisely what we', 'have here. Motion to sever is denied.” Although we agree with the trial justice’s ultimate conclusion, we arrive at our decision by employing a separate and somewhat different line of reasoning.', 'In Day, 898 A.2d at 703, this Court held that the joinder of two separate indictments for two robberies involved incidents of a sufficiently similar character because “[b]oth incidents involved the same base criminal offenses:', 'robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.” Moreover, both offenses occurred “within close proximity in downtown Providence, within a', '- 12 - two month time span, at a similar time of day, and the victims were close in age.” Id. Finally, the defendant used a similar modus operandi in conducting the robberies. Id. In Hernandez, 822 A.2d at 918, this Court held that the joinder of three indictments for five offenses was proper under “the same or similar character” scenario because, in each of three sexual assaults or attempted sexual assaults, the defendant had picked up women and used force against them to demand sex and/or money. Hernandez also involved a firearm that was used for two of the incidents, but not the third. Id. Although the trial justice correctly noted that the defendants in Day and Hernandez used a firearm to perpetrate their offenses in some incidents but not others, this Court did not rely upon that fact to support Rule 8 joinder. Instead, the Court focused on the similarity of the offenses and the methods used to perpetrate them to find joinder to be proper under Rule 8(a).', 'In Pereira, 973 A.2d at 25 n.5, this Court adopted the “broader” approach as articulated by the First and Ninth Circuits when addressing “same or similar character” joinder questions. In addition to the factors we outlined in Pereira, the Ninth Circuit also considers “the likelihood and extent of evidentiary overlap.” Jawara, 474 F.3d at 578. However, even this approach recognizes that mere evidentiary overlap is not dispositive. See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 628 (“Congress did not provide for joinder for unrelated transactions and dissimilar crimes merely because some evidence might be common to all of the counts.”). The indictment alleged that Brown had been in possession of a red firearm during each incident. Moreover, at trial, two witnesses stated that the pistol that the police recovered after the August 6 incident was uniquely akin to the one that had been observed during the beating and robbery of Restrepo. Thus, the key piece of evidence, the red firearm, had a strong likelihood of overlap between both the August 4 and August 6 incidents.', '- 13 -', 'Secondly, joinder was proper because the two “transactions” were “connected together.” In State v. Cline, 122 R.I. 297, 329, 405 A.2d 1192, 1209 (1979), the defendant escaped from the Adult Correctional Institutions and, while at large, committed murder. Although the facts of Cline are not analogous to the present case, we did discuss in that case that the “connected together” scenario for joinder applied when evidence of one event would overlap for a second event. Id.; see also United States v. Richardson, 161 F.3d 728, 734 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (“Where there is substantial overlap in evidence between two offenses, joinder ‘eliminate[s] the need to prove substantially the same evidence twice over, thus realizing precisely the kind of economy envisaged by Rule 8(a).’” (quoting Blunt v. United States, 404 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1968))). Here, the red gun would have been admissible at separate trials for the two separate offenses of carrying a firearm without a license. In our opinion, this is a strong argument favoring joinder under Rule 8(a).', 'The defendant maintains that this Court’s decision in State v. Trepanier, 600 A.2d 1311 (R.I. 1991), in which we decided Rule 8 joinder was inappropriate, is analogous to the present case. We disagree. In Trepanier, the defendant had been charged with twenty-seven offenses, some of which stemmed from sniping and others from a later spree of offenses for breaking and entering and arson. Id. at 1315. The Court concluded that joinder was improper because none of the Rule 8(a) justifications was sufficiently present to permit joinder. Trepanier, 600 A.2d at 1316. However, we are convinced joinder was proper here because Rule 8(a) determinations focus on the charges in the indictment and not the offenses of which defendant was ultimately convicted.', '- 14 -', 'B', 'Rule 14 Severance', 'The defendant next argues that even if the offenses were properly joined under Rule 8(a), the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied defendant’s Rule 14 motion to sever the August 4 offenses from the August 6 offenses. The defendant contends that joinder of both sets of offenses resulted in real and substantial prejudice to him because the jury inferred that he had a criminal disposition, and the joinder resulted in cumulating evidence of guilt. At trial, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to sever because:', '“I’m satisfied fully that there’s a clear nexus between the', 'defendant’s alleged possession of the firearm on the 6th of August', 'to the events that allegedly occurred on the 4th of August. The', 'description of the gun is peculiar in that it was a red gun in each', 'instance, and it links, as the [s]tate would claim, the defendant’s', 'presence on the 4th with that red gun. Identification becomes', 'important and is relevant in that regard.”', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'The decision to sever joined counts against a defendant as authorized by Rule 14 “is not a matter of right, but rather is confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Kluth, 46 A.3d at 875. This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s decision regarding a Rule 14 motion to sever absent a clear abuse of discretion. Kluth, 46 A.3d at 875 (citing Pereira, 973 A.2d at 27-28). “It is not enough simply to show that joinder makes it more difficult [for the defendant] to defend.” State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 309 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Lassor, 555 A.2d 339, 346 (R.I. 1989)).', 'We will overturn a trial justice’s Rule 14 severance determination only when a defendant has shown “that the trial justice’s denial of the motion to sever prejudiced the defendant to such a degree that he or she was denied a fair trial.” Goulet, 21 A.3d at 309 (quoting Pereira, 973 A.2d at 28). More importantly, “in cases in which the outcome would have', '- 15 - been the same had separate trials been held, we will not disturb the trial justice’s decision not to sever, even when the defendant may have suffered some disadvantage in defending against the joined counts simultaneously.” State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137, 144 (R.I. 2000).', '2', 'Discussion', 'Our holding that Rule 8(a) joinder in this case was proper does not end the inquiry into whether all the charges brought against defendant should have been tried together. See State v. King, 693 A.2d 658, 663 (R.I. 1997). Brown correctly points out that, even if joinder under Rule 8 is proper, “a defendant may nonetheless be prejudiced to such an extent that relief from joinder is appropriate under Rule 14.” Goulet, 21 A.3d at 309. Rule 14 provides that “[i]f it appears that a defendant or the [s]tate is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * the court may order an election or separate trials of counts * * * or provide whatever other relief justice requires.”', 'We determine whether the defendant has demonstrated substantial prejudice by balancing “efficiency and convenience in judicial administration on the one hand and the defendant’s right to a fair trial without prejudice on the other.” Pereira, 973 A.2d at 28 (quoting Day, 898 A.2d at 705). Even though the burden to establish the presence of substantial prejudice lies with the defendant, demonstrating substantial prejudice is not an insurmountable obstacle. “[P]rejudice may result from ‘a latent feeling of hostility engendered by the charging of several crimes as distinct from only one.’” Id. (quoting Day, 898 A.2d at 705).', 'In his effort to convince us that he has shown substantial prejudice, defendant maintains that the evidence presented by the state was not mutually admissible; therefore, he argues, the jury was exposed to highly prejudicial information from which it could infer that he possessed a criminal disposition. The defendant stresses that because possession of a gun was not an element', '- 16 - of the charges stemming from either incident, nor was a firearm used in the commission of either offense, the evidence of the red gun would not have been admissible at separate trials. The state counters that evidence of Brown’s flight from police on August 6 would have been admissible evidence of consciousness of guilt. Further, the state argues, the jury would likely have heard in a separate trial how the police came to obtain the red firearm, accompanied by the testimony about the unusual nature of the pistol.', 'We are not convinced that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the motion to sever under Rule 14. Although there may be other possible reasons that defendant fled from the police, such as the fact that he was on bail for two separate felonies, possession of cocaine and robbery, and the fact that he was driving a vehicle that had a loaded firearm inside it, the flight may well have been probative of his consciousness of guilt for the murder and robbery of Restrepo, which, after all, had occurred just two days earlier and had been witnessed by several bystanders. See State v. Bishop, 68 A.3d 409, 423 (R.I. 2013) (The defendant’s failure to report to his parole officer was “probative of his consciousness of guilt.”). Had the counts been severed, the evidence of the car chase on August 6 would almost certainly have been admitted in a trial for the August 4 incident to manifest consciousness of guilt. See United States v. Stackpole, 811 F.2d 689, 694 (1st Cir. 1987).', 'Furthermore, evidence of the rare red gun would have likely been mutually admissible in separate trials under the provisions of Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. It is axiomatic that “Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of evidence of past crimes, wrongs, or acts ‘to show the defendant’s propensity to commit the crime with which he is currently charged.’” State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 150 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 926 (R.I. 2005)). However, Rule 404(b) makes it “equally plain” that such evidence may be admissible', '- 17 - for other purposes such as identity. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150. At the time of the hearing on defendant’s Rule 14 motion to sever, the firearm counts relating to the August 6 incident, counts 7 and 8, accusing defendant of using a firearm to commit a crime of violence and carrying a pistol without a license, were each “live issues” because they had not yet been disposed of pursuant to Rule 29. The trial justice indicated as much, observing that identification was an important issue and relevant to the case. In our opinion, it was not error to conclude that evidence of the red firearm would have been mutually admissible at separate trials. We have stated previously that “[w]here evidence of one crime would be admissible at a separate trial of another charge, a defendant will not suffer any additional prejudice if the two charges are tried together.” Cline, 122 R.I. at 329, 405 A.2d at 1209 (quoting McKnight v. State, 375 A.2d 551, 555 (Md. 1977)); see also State v. Cofield, 605 A.2d 230, 234 (N.J. 1992) (“[T]he distinctive features of a silver pistol used in a prior crime would be admissible under [Rule 404(b)] in an unrelated murder trial to establish either the identity of the perpetrator or the weapon used.”).', 'It is unlikely that testimony relating to charges arising from the police chase prejudiced the jurors, deciding the more serious charges emanating from the August 4 incident, to such a degree that they would improperly draw an inference that defendant must be guilty of the murder and robbery of Restrepo. Without question, the testimony relating to the reckless driving was secondary compared to the graphic testimony surrounding Restrepo’s murder. The August 6 evidence would have represented “only a tiny fraction of the testimony heard by the jury, and did not involve conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was charged.” United States v. Roldan-Zapata, 916 F.2d 795, 804 (2d Cir. 1990).', 'We are equally unpersuaded by defendant’s second contention that the trial justice abused his discretion by denying the motion to sever because joinder likely caused the jury to cumulate', '- 18 - evidence from the two crimes when it would not have done so had the offenses been tried separately. Even though at the close of the evidence the reckless driving charge was the only remaining offense emanating from the August 6 police chase, the trial justice did provide a specific instruction to the jury members reminding them of their duty to consider each offense separately as well as a reminder that the state has the burden of proving each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the evidence of the red pistol is common to both incidents, this and other evidence were not so intertwined and complex that it would likely confuse the jury or provide incentive for the jurors to cumulate evidence. See United States v. Riccardi, 258 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 1231 (D. Kan. 2003).', 'C', 'The Police Sketch', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice impeded his right to present a defense when he excluded a police sketch that he maintains did not resemble him from the jury’s consideration. Late in the evening of August 4, 2008, a witness by the name of Efrain Benitez gave a statement to Det. Nathan McGarry of the Central Falls police department about what he had seen earlier that day. Benitez told the police that he had observed the attack on Restrepo, which took place directly outside his home on Watson Street. He described seeing two men assault Restrepo, indicating that he got a good look at one and saying that “[t]he big one was black, very dark skinned, tall and skinny. His hair was covered with a black cover.” He also said that he thought he would be able to recognize the “big black guy again.” Based on that discussion, the Central Falls police called upon Linda Eastman, a sketch artist and retired Warwick police captain, to produce a likeness of the assailant based on Benitez’s description.', '- 19 -', 'However, by the time the matter was reached for trial, Benitez could not be called as a witness because he could not be located.', 'Nonetheless, defendant attempted to call Capt. Eastman as a witness in an effort to offer her sketch as an exhibit because, Brown claimed, the sketch did not resemble him, and it, therefore, would be probative information for the jury. Obviously, defendant sought to introduce the sketch to rebut the eyewitness identification by Diego Rodriguez. The defendant argued that the sketch was admissible for two reasons. First, he claimed that the sketch could be introduced under Rule 804(b)(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, the “catch-all” exception to the hearsay rule. 10 Secondly, defendant maintained that the sketch was admissible under Rules 702 and 703 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because, he maintained, Capt. Eastman was positioned to provide expert testimony. The trial justice did not agree; he excluded the sketch categorizing it as hearsay because, without Benitez’s testimony, it did not “in any way carry the imprimatur of trustworthiness that exceptions to the hearsay rule require.” Further, the trial justice did not allow Capt. Eastman to testify as an expert witness because her expertise was not similar to that of a doctor, who forms her opinion to render a diagnosis or perform surgery.', 'On appeal, defendant first contends that the sketch itself is not hearsay because hearsay requires a statement and a sketch is not a statement.', 'Alternatively, defendant renews his arguments below that the sketch, even if properly characterized as a statement, is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under Rule 804(b)(5). Further, he maintains that the sketch was 10', 'Rules 803(24) and 804(b)(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence are both considered “catch-all” exceptions to the hearsay rule. The defendant asserted Rule 804(b)(5) in this case because Benitez was an unavailable witness. See Martinez v. Kurdziel, 612 A.2d 669, 673-74 (R.I. 1992) (“Rule 803(24) is the catchall provision when the unavailability of a witness is not required, and Rule 804(b)(5), the catchall provision when the witness is unavailable according to specific enumerated categories.”).', '- 20 - admissible under Rule 702 because Capt. Eastman was an expert in her field. We do not agree with defendant’s arguments.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial justice’s decisions on the admission of evidence by employing an abuse-of-discretion standard. State v. Young, 78 A.3d 787, 792 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999)). We will uphold the trial justice’s decision “unless the trial justice abused his or her discretion and the admission of irrelevant evidence was prejudicial to a defendant’s rights.” Id. (quoting Evans, 742 A.2d at 719). Thus, there is no abuse of discretion provided some reasoning supporting the trial justice’s decision appears in the record. Id.', '2', 'Discussion', 'Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines “hearsay” as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Rule 801(a) defines a “statement” as “(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.” The defendant contends that the police sketch is not hearsay because it is not a statement.', 'To support this reasoning, defendant claims that the sketch is the functional equivalent of a photograph, which does not amount to an assertion and is therefore not hearsay.', 'Several courts have addressed whether a police sketch is hearsay, and there is a lack of unanimity on the issue. The Second Circuit concluded that the introduction of a police sketch by the government was not a “statement” and “therefore can no more be ‘hearsay’ than a', '- 21 - photograph identified by a witness.” United States v. Moskowitz, 581 F.2d 14, 21 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 871 (1978). Although, in that case, the court concluded the sketch was not hearsay, the court did go on to say that the sketch was not admitted as a statement by the sketch artist, but to show the likeness the declarants had testified to at trial. Id. Also, extensive testimony at trial established that the police sketch introduced into evidence was the same sketch that the declarants identified and had helped produce. Id. Thus, and significantly, the declarants not only testified at the trial but they also properly authenticated the sketch. In contrast, the Court of Appeals of New York has long held that not only are composite sketches hearsay, but also, in most circumstances, merely mentioning that a witness worked with a police sketch artist is unduly prejudicial.', 'See People v. Maldonado, 769 N.E.2d 1281, 1285-86 (N.Y. 2002) (describing the court’s precedents finding police sketches to be hearsay). Notably, for our purposes, that case also holds that “[a] composite sketch ‘may not be admitted simply to counteract evidence * * * which casts doubt on the reliability of [a] complainant’s identification.’” Id. at 1286 (quoting People v. Falterman, 424 N.Y.S.2d 481, 482 (N.Y. App. Div. 1980)).', 'Although defendant urges this Court to conclude that police sketches are not hearsay, we need not reach that issue to determine if the trial justice abused his discretion by excluding the sketch. The primary difficulty here, where it is not disputed that the declarant was unavailable, is one of authentication. The defendant argues that the police sketch should be treated as a photograph, but a photograph is received into evidence only after a witness with personal knowledge testifies that it is a true and accurate representation. See State v. Carvalho, 892 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2006). Also, in the context of other illustrations such as maps, we have held that they are admissible if “shown to be reasonably accurate.” State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321,', '- 22 - 324 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Greene, 74 R.I. 437, 443, 60 A.2d 711, 715 (1948)). More importantly, there is a significant distinction between a photograph, which is a visual record, and a sketch, which is an artist’s rendering based only on statements and direction from an eyewitness. We cannot conceive of a situation in which Capt. Eastman would be able to properly authenticate the accuracy of the sketch without resorting to hearsay because, at the time she drew the sketch, she had no personal knowledge of the appearance of the assailant.', 'The defendant next argues that, even if the sketch is hearsay, the trial justice erred in excluding it because the sketch was admissible under Rule 804(b)(5) or the “catch-all” exception. “Under Rule 804(b)(5)(B), an out-of-court statement made by an unavailable witness can be admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, if, among other requirements, ‘the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts.’” State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 750 (R.I. 2005). As defendant correctly points out, we have held previously, “[i]n each case where Rule 804(b)(5) is invoked, the court is essentially creating a new exception to the hearsay rule. If the hearsay rule is to retain any life, a demand for the creation of a new exception counsels caution and should be granted only where special ‘trustworthiness’ is shown.” Estate of Sweeney v. Charpentier, 675 A.2d 824, 827 (R.I. 1996) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Wolfson v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., 455 F. Supp. 82, 88 (M.D. Pa.), aff’d, 588 F.2d 825 (3d Cir. 1978)). Although we have no reason to doubt that Capt. Eastman faithfully complied to the best of her ability with the instructions of Benitez when she created the sketch, we cannot accept that there is an indication of special trustworthiness that would justify a conclusion that the trial justice abused his discretion when he declined to admit the sketch under this exception.', '- 23 -', 'Alternatively, defendant argues that the sketch was admissible under Rules 702 and 703 because, he contends, Capt. Eastman was an expert. Rule 702 provides that “[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of fact or opinion.” The defendant argues that had Capt. Eastman been allowed to testify as an expert witness, Rule 703 would have permitted her to recount what Benitez had told her about the appearance of the assailant because those statements contained the information upon which she relied in creating the sketch. 11 The trial justice ruled that Capt. Eastman’s ability to accurately represent pictographically what Benitez relayed to her was not comparable to the actions taken by a doctor in forming an expert opinion in order to render a diagnosis or perform surgery. We agree.', 'We have no doubt that Capt. Eastman has a great deal of skill and experience in creating a composite sketch; but, unlike a doctor, she cannot independently evaluate Benitez’s description to provide the necessary level of trustworthiness or reliability normally contemplated under Rules 702 and 703. In other words, a doctor receives the history provided to him by a patient and then performs his own examination and diagnostic tests seeking objective conditions and symptoms. It is those findings, combined with his education and experience that allows the physician or other expert to render an opinion. Conversely, the sketch artist must rely solely upon the word of another person to produce his product. Therefore, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in declining to admit the police sketch or in disallowing the proposed testimony of Capt. Eastman. 11', 'Rule 703 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states that “[i]f of a type reasonably and customarily relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions upon the subject, the underlying facts or data shall be admissible without testimony from the primary source.”', '- 24 -', 'D', 'The Autopsy Photos', 'Brown contends that the trial justice impaired his right to a fair trial when he overruled defendant’s objection to the admission of three autopsy photographs presented during the testimony of the state’s medical examiner, Doctor Alexander Cherkov. During his testimony, Doctor Cherkov informed the jury that he had conducted an autopsy on Restrepo, a procedure that included both internal and external examinations. Doctor Cherkov testified that during the external examination of Restrepo’s body, he found bruises and abrasions on Restrepo’s head indicating a hemorrhage from blunt-force trauma as well as increased mobility of Restrepo’s neck, indicating possible fractures of the upper vertebrae. Doctor Cherkov testified that he then conducted an internal examination, which involved retraction of the skin on the skull and then the opening of the skull so that he could examine the brain. After retracting the skin, Doctor Cherkov found a subgaleal hemorrhage, which is bleeding between the scalp and the skull, in the left temporal area.', 'Doctor Cherkov next examined Restrepo’s brain, finding a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is bleeding from small blood vessels that cover the brain and provide blood to the brain’s cortex. Finally, Doctor Cherkov testified that Restrepo died from blunt-force trauma to the head, and that his wounds were consistent with a homicide.', 'The defendant objected to three of the eight photographs from the autopsy that the state wished both to introduce as evidence and to display in the courtroom. The defendant, citing Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence argued that because the cause of death was not in dispute, whatever limited probative value the photos would provide was outweighed by their prejudicial effect. The photographs, defendant argued, depicted the victim’s remains in the aftermath of the autopsy, and not just the physical damage that defendant was alleged to have', '- 25 - inflicted.', 'The trial justice overruled the objection and found the photos were not overly prejudicial. He reasoned that this Court’s precedents favor admission of photographs, even if they are unpleasant and that the photos were probative and relevant because they assisted the medical examiner in explaining his testimony.', 'In addition, after overruling the objection, the trial justice imparted the following instruction to the jury:', '“You’ll remember, folks, when we started the trial, you', 'were forewarned that there would be some unpleasant evidence', 'that you would have to look at. We are at the point where you will', 'now be looking at some of that unpleasant evidence. They are', 'autopsy photographs. And I remind you of your obligations, and', 'that is to say that you are fact finders. You are not to be distracted', 'by what you see in the photographs, such that you [lose] sight of', 'your ultimate goal, which is to determine if that which you see in', 'the photographs here from the medical examiner are injuries that', 'were caused by the man on trial. You have to make that', 'determination from all the evidence that is submitted to you, and', 'you must not be so distracted or impassioned about these', 'photographs that you lose sight of the ultimate goal that you must', 'accomplish in an impartial and detached manner.” The state then displayed each of the photographs on a projector while Doctor Cherkov used a laser pointer to explain his medical findings.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'We review a trial justice’s decisions on admissibility of photographs under an abuse-of- discretion standard. See State v. Carter, 744 A.2d 839, 847 (R.I. 2000) (“A trial justice has wide discretion to determine the materiality and relevance of crime-scene and murder-victim photographs.”). “[D]etermining the relevance of photographs is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Belloli, 766 A.2d 928, 930 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Spratt, 742 A.2d 1194, 1198 (R.I. 1999)).', '- 26 -', '2', 'Discussion', 'When, as here, a defendant challenges the admission of photographs under Rule 403, “[o]ur function is to review the record and to determine whether the trial justice carefully considered whether the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by undue prejudice, ‘keeping in mind that even if the evidence offered * * * might tend to influence the jury unduly, it may nevertheless be admissible if it is otherwise material and competent.” Belloli, 766 A.2d at 930 (quoting Spratt, 742 A.2d at 1198). We determine whether the photograph is “of such a nature as to inflame the jurors and therefore prejudice them beyond the ordinary prejudice that is always sustained by the introduction of relevant evidence intended to prove guilt.” State v. Beauchamp, 671 A.2d 1238, 1241 (R.I. 1996) (quoting State v. Fenner, 503 A.2d 518, 526 (R.I. 1986)). Therefore, we will not overturn a trial justice’s determination unless the evidence is “marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial.” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 466 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 675 (R.I. 2012)).', '“A photograph is relevant if it has a tendency to ‘prove or disprove some material fact in issue.’” State v. Rivera, 640 A.2d 524, 526 (R.I. 1994) (quoting State v. Correia, 600 A.2d 279, 285 (R.I. 1991)). Autopsy photographs, like those from crime scenes or of murder victims may be difficult for jurors to see, “yet this Court has recognized that because it is the state’s burden to prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, such photographs are unquestionably relevant to its need to do so.” Carter, 744 A.2d at 847 (citing State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 424 (R.I. 1993)). However, photographs of a murder victim should be excluded if “offered solely to inflame the passions of the jury * * * .” Id. (emphasis omitted).', '- 27 -', 'The defendant offers a more nuanced argument than those that we have considered previously. First, defendant did not challenge the inclusion of all eight of the photographs of the victims, but only the three that defendant argues are particularly gruesome. The first, exhibit 10, depicts the victim’s neck, shoulders, and head with his skin peeled back over his skull and hair protruding from the folded over skin from his scalp. The second and third, exhibits 11 and 12, depict the victim’s brain, one after the top of the skull has been cut away and the other with the brain removed from the skull and placed by itself on a towel. Moreover, defendant maintains that because the cause of death was not in dispute, the photos served no purpose but to inflame the jury.', 'Although the photographs in question are disturbing to the point of being grisly, we cannot conclude that the trial justice abused his discretion by admitting them. Very few courts have addressed a situation similar to the one with which we are presented here, where only some of the photographs are challenged and the cause of death is not in dispute. The Supreme Court of Kansas has dealt with a similar set of arguments on multiple occasions with varying results. In State v. Boyd, 532 P.2d 1064, 1068 (Kan. 1975), the defendant had challenged but one photograph of fourteen offered, and he did not challenge the cause of death. The court held that that one picture was so gruesome that its admission was an abuse of discretion because several other photos had already demonstrated the medical testimony of the medical examiner, leading the court to conclude the challenged photo was offered solely to inflame the jury. Id. (“[E]xhibit 39 showed the body of the deceased cut open from chin to groin and laid out like a disemboweled beef in a packing plant.”). Although the Kansas Supreme Court never specifically overruled Boyd, there was not another finding of an abuse of discretion with respect to autopsy photographs until two cases in the 1990’s, in which the defendants challenged only one or two', '- 28 - autopsy photos and the manner of death was not disputed. See State v. Sherrer, 912 P.2d 747, 756 (Kan. 1996) (“After reviewing the other photographs, we fail to see the necessity for admitting into evidence repetitious photographs which, in addition to demonstrating the angle of penetration, also showed the effect of the autopsy on the deceased’s body.”); State v. Adam, 896 P.2d 1022, 1032 (Kan. 1995) (“There seems to be no probative value to Exhibit 7G. * * * [T]he heart has been pulled out of the chest cavity and cut open to show a cross-section.”). However, other courts have noted that stipulating to the cause of death does not lead to an automatic exclusion of the autopsy photographs. See State v. Frazier, 652 N.E.2d 1000, 1010 (Ohio 1995) (“[T]he fact that appellant stipulated the cause of death does not automatically render the photographs inadmissible.” (quoting State v. Maurer, 473 N.E.2d 768, 792 (Ohio 1984))).', 'There certainly are similarities between those cases and this one; however, as disturbing as the exhibits may be, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion because the state presented photographs to the jury which did serve as visual aids to explain Doctor Cherkov’s testimony about the effect of the blunt-force trauma on the victim’s skull and brain. Exhibit 10 is likely the most gruesome of the three, and it is the one we have most carefully considered, but even that photograph assists in the understanding of Doctor Cherkov’s testimony about the subgaleal hemorrhage suffered by the victim. As we held in State v. Winston, 105 R.I. 447, 450, 252 A.2d 354, 356 (1969), photographs are “admissible into evidence as an aid to the jury in arriving at a proper understanding of the evidence as proof of the corpus delicti, the extent of injury, [and] the condition and identification of the body * * * .” We are unable to conclude that the trial justice abused his discretion when he ruled that the state did not present these photographs solely to inflame the passions of the jury because, even though the cause of death was not in dispute, the state still bore the burden of proving every element of the case beyond a', '- 29 - reasonable doubt. Moreover, the trial justice instructed the jury about the unpleasant images that the state was about to show before he allowed the state to display the photographs as well as reminding them of each juror’s duty to not be distracted or “impassioned” by the photographs. See Commonwealth v. Phinney, 622 N.E.2d 617, 624 (Mass. 1993) (“Admission of the photographs was within the judge’s discretion, and the judge furnished adequate instructions to the jury to guide their consideration of the evidence.”). We are therefore of the opinion that there was no error in their admission.', 'E', 'Rule 33 Motion for a New Trial', 'Also before us on appeal is the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial under Rule 33. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the five counts submitted to it, defendant filed a motion for a new trial.

In the detailed decision that underlies that judgment, the trial justice ruled that the State of Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) had not engaged in employment discrimination against the plaintiff.1', 'This case stems from plaintiff’s allegation that he was subjected to discrimination based on his military status when the DOC denied him promotion on three separate occasions.

Accordingly, the claims against that entity were dismissed with prejudice by the Superior Court on November 9, 2009. Consequently, the trial justice’s decision focused only on the remaining defendant, the DOC.', '-1- Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), as codified in 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301 through 4335, and the parallel state statute which is entitled “Employment Rights of Members of Armed Forces,” G.L. 1956 chapter 11 of title 30. However, plaintiff contends that the trial justice incorrectly applied the burden-shifting method. The plaintiff further asserts that what he considers to be relevant and material evidence supportive of his “prima facie” case of employment discrimination was overlooked or misconceived by the trial justice.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of defendant.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Donald Panarello became a member of the Rhode Island Air National Guard in 1983.

The plaintiff contends that the discrimination which he allegedly suffered arose out of the tension between his military and civilian careers during the years when he was on military leave. Specifically, he contends that the DOC’s failure to promote him to lieutenant on three occasions during the six- year period was motivated by his military leave status in violation of the above-referenced provisions of federal and state law.', 'On October 21, 2003, plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action requesting relief from the Superior Court with respect to the DOC’s alleged discrimination.

By the time of trial he had retired from the DOC. Mr. Truman testified about the promotional process for corrections officers in general and about Mr. Panarello’s situation in particular. We summarize below the essential portions of his testimony.', 'Corrections officers interested in promotion to the position of lieutenant would begin the process by sitting for a written examination.2 Those who score high enough on that examination are deemed qualified for promotion. When lieutenant positions become available, typically the candidates with the highest scores on the written examination are granted interviews before an interview panel;3 at those interviews, each candidate is asked the same set of questions. It is uncontested that, by that point in the process, a candidate’s examination score is no longer of significance; a sufficiently high score earns a candidate entry to the interview process, but it then 2', 'The promotional process within the DOC falls under the aegis of Rhode Island’s Merit System statute, which is codified in G.L. 1956 chapter 4 of title 36. 3', 'Mr. Truman testified that it is possible that one or other of the candidates interviewed would not have been a candidate with a top examination score—because, for example, a candidate may decide that he or she is not interested in being promoted at that time or may be unavailable.', '-3- ceases to play any further role. Each panelist ranks every candidate’s answers to the above- referenced set of questions individually, and then the scores awarded by the various panel members are combined to provide each candidate with an overall interview score. The panel then compiles a list of the candidates ranked according to their overall interview scores. The panel also makes specific recommendations as to which candidates should receive a second interview.4 Those recommendations do not necessarily reflect the overall interview scores; for example, a candidate who ranked sixth in overall interview score could still be recommended by the panel as the top candidate to fill an open lieutenant position. The recommended candidates are then interviewed by Ashbel T. Wall (Director of the DOC) and an associate director.5 The ultimate decision as to who will be promoted is made by Director Wall.', 'Mr. Panarello sat for the written examination in 1999, and he placed “7-B” out of hundreds of examinees. In 2001, there were five vacant lieutenant positions for which twelve corrections officers, including plaintiff, were interviewed.', 'Seven candidates were then recommended to be promoted to lieutenant. The plaintiff was not one of them.', 'In January of 2002, plaintiff wrote to Mr. Truman contending that his military leave status had had “a negative impact on [his] promotion to Lieutenant” and stating that there was “absolutely no reason to justify not promoting” him. He alleged in the letter that Director Wall himself had told him that he would not be promoted while on military leave and that David Caruso, one of the members of the 2001 interview panel, had “chastised” him for appearing at the interview in his military uniform. The plaintiff concluded his letter by expressing his wish to 4', 'Mr. Truman testified that interview panels sometimes make recommendations and sometimes do not.

As a consequence of plaintiff’s letter, a meeting was held between Mr. Truman and plaintiff. While Mr. Truman testified that he had no recollection of that specific meeting, plaintiff testified that such a meeting did take place—although he added that the only result therefrom was Mr. Truman’s statement at the meeting that Director Wall made the final decision about promotions.', 'In May of 2002, there were additional vacancies for a position as a lieutenant, and Mr. Panarello was once again interviewed. Mr. Caruso was again a member of the interview panel.

After participating in the interview process this second time, Mr. Panarello was again not recommended for promotion.6 On May 2, 2002, plaintiff sent Mr. Truman another letter alleging that his active duty status had again had a negative effect on his chances for promotion to lieutenant. In that letter, plaintiff alleged that Walter Whitman, a 2002 interview panelist, had told him that “as long as [he was] out on military leave [he] would not be eligible for promotion to the position of [lieutenant].”', 'The third incident of alleged discrimination occurred in June of 2002, when plaintiff was offered a “three-day rule” appointment as a lieutenant for a temporary period.7 The offer was 6', 'Mr. Truman testified that the management staff at the DOC in 2001 and 2002 was not familiar with the requirements of the USERRA.

The plaintiff responded to having the offer of a “three-day rule” position withdrawn due to his unavailability by sending another letter to Mr. Truman alleging that “the discrimination [he] encountered while on military leave [was] an ongoing issue.”', 'Finally, as plaintiff testified, he was promoted to lieutenant, in 2007, after his return from military leave.', '2. The Plaintiff’s Testimony', 'After Mr. Truman’s testimony, plaintiff took the stand.', 'With respect to the 2001 promotional process, Mr. Panarello testified that, when he “showed up for the panel,” Mr. Caruso asked him why he was wearing his military uniform and then stated: “It’s not going to look good.” Moreover, plaintiff stated that he had scored higher on the written examination than four of the five people who were selected for promotion. He further testified that he and his wife had encountered Director Wall and his wife at the Providence Place Mall a few weeks before Christmas in 2000. According to plaintiff, when discussing the likelihood of promotion while the DOC can fill that position by “taking someone of lower rank and placing them into [the] position * * * .” In his testimony, Mr. Truman characterized such a personnel action as “a temporary appointment;” and he further testified that an individual can stay in a “three-day rule” position for only six months before he or she will lose seniority benefits from his or her previous position. According to Mr. Truman’s testimony, the decision as to whom to appoint to a “three- day rule” position is confided to the sole discretion of Director Wall. The “three-day rule” was also sometimes referred to as the “eleven-day rule” in the trial testimony. 8', 'Mr. Truman acknowledged that plaintiff had told him that, if he were offered a promotion, he would leave military service and return to the DOC. However, plaintiff testified that he still would not have been able to start immediately due to the necessity of: (1) giving adequate notice that he was leaving his military position; and (2) training a replacement.', '-6- plaintiff was on military leave, Director Wall stated: “I would not promote you to a position of lieutenant if you’re not here to do the job. I need someone to do the job.”9', 'Mr. Panarello next testified about his 2002 interview, and he indicated that panel member Carol Getter had remarked about the fact that he was on active military duty. In addition, plaintiff testified that Walter Whitman (also a panel member) told him that “it would not be a good management move to promote [him] to the position of lieutenant;” plaintiff added, however, that Mr. Whitman also stated that Director Wall would make the ultimate decision.10 And he also acknowledged that Mr. Whitman commended him for his military service.', 'The plaintiff then proceeded to testify with respect to the “three-day rule” position (see footnote 7, supra) that was offered to him in June of 2002; he stated that he was asked to start working in that position right away11 but that he told the person who offered him the position that he would not be able to start until late August or early September due to his military duties. It was plaintiff’s further testimony that he was not given the “three-day rule” position because he could not start immediately—whereas, he added, he later learned that the position was not filled until late October or early November. 9', 'The plaintiff’s wife, Maryann Panarello, gave confirmatory testimony at trial with respect to plaintiff’s testimony about the chance meeting with Director Wall at the Providence Place Mall. 10', 'The plaintiff acknowledged at trial that Mr. Whitman’s statement came in response to his own question to Mr. Whitman about his chances of promotion to lieutenant. 11', 'The plaintiff testified that he was offered the position on a Friday and was expected to start the following Monday.', '-7-', 'The plaintiff further testified that, when he returned to the DOC in 2006, he once again sat for the written examination for promotion to lieutenant—this time ranking 27A.12 Thereafter, in September of 2007, he was promoted to lieutenant. He stated at trial that, except for the fact that he had obtained a bachelor’s degree in 2007, his qualifications had not changed dramatically from the 2001 and 2002 interviews to the time of his promotion in 2007.', 'On cross-examination, plaintiff acknowledged that in his deposition he had expressed his understanding that the written examination score was without significance once a candidate received an interview.', 'He further recognized, in testifying on cross-examination, that his interview score in 2001 ranked him eleventh of twelve candidates. The plaintiff also admitted to bringing his military service to the attention of the 2002 interview panel of his own accord. Specifically, he testified that he thought that he needed to educate the interview panel about the USERRA. His cross-examination also elicited the following facts: (1) that he was unaware that there are National Guard regulations prohibiting the wearing of a National Guard uniform to a civilian interview; (2) that his interview score in 2002 ranked him fifth of seven candidates; (3) that he did not review current DOC policies before his 2002 interview, despite the fact that they were available at the training academy; (4) that one of the candidates selected for promotion in 2002, one Joseph Mullensky, also had a military background; and (5) that the other candidate selected in 2002 was one William Bove, who had approximately twenty years of managerial experience and ten years of labor relations experience. 12', 'In 2006, Mr. Panarello sat for the written examination for promotion to lieutenant a second time because, pursuant to § 36-4-22(a)(1)(ii), a “promotion list[]” generated from a written examination for promotion is only “in effect for a period of three * * * years * * * .”', '-8-', '3. The Testimony of Joseph Forgue, Jr. and John Lavery', 'After plaintiff’s testimony concluded, two additional witnesses were presented on his behalf—Joseph Forgue, Jr. and John Lavery.', 'At the time of trial, Mr. Forgue was a DOC Special Investigator. He testified that he had served in the Rhode Island National Guard and that the DOC had failed to select him for an interview for promotion to lieutenant in 2001 and 2002 even though he had passed the written examination for lieutenant and was ranked eleventh; he further stated that, when he returned from active duty, he expressed interest in serving as the Chief of the Special Investigations Unit on a temporary “three-day rule” basis but was not given that opportunity. He added that he was not given the “materials or opportunity” to take a make-up written examination upon his return from a 2004 deployment. Mr. Forgue indicated at trial that he believed being away on military leave put him at a disadvantage with respect to being promoted. However, he did acknowledge in his testimony on cross-examination that he had served as temporary Chief of the Special Investigations Unit on a number of occasions and that he was later interviewed for the position of Chief on a permanent basis, although someone else was ultimately selected.', 'At the time of trial, Mr. Lavery was a DOC training instructor; he had served in the Massachusetts National Guard for approximately twelve years, receiving an honorable discharge in 2002. He alleged in his testimony at trial that, upon his return from overseas duty, he was informed by the DOC that he still had to complete a six-month probationary period which had started before his military leave. According to his testimony, he took issue with the DOC’s position on his probationary period because he believed that the probationary period should have expired while he was on military leave. He further testified that he had engaged in a dispute with the DOC concerning bidding rights, pay, retirement, sick time, and vacation time due to the', '-9- DOC’s requirement that he serve the remainder of his probationary period upon returning from military leave, but he acknowledged that the bidding rights issue was resolved in his favor.', 'B', 'The Witnesses for the Defense', '1. The Testimony of Carol Getter', 'Carol Getter was a correctional officer who held the rank of lieutenant when she served on the 2002 interview panel. At the time of trial she had retired from the DOC after more than thirty years of service. She testified that, when serving on the interview panel, she looked for a candidate who was self-confident, who was knowledgeable about departmental policies and procedures, and who would represent the department in a “beneficial light.” Ms. Getter stated at trial that plaintiff arrived for the interview wearing his military uniform, mentioned that he was on military leave, and specifically told the panel that, according to law, his active duty status could not be held against him with respect to promotion. She further testified that, from her perspective, plaintiff’s military uniform was a “positive factor;” she also stated that she did not recall any comments by other panel members about the uniform.', 'It was Ms. Getter’s further testimony, however, that plaintiff acknowledged during the interview before the panel that he was not up-to-date on DOC policies and procedures; she added that he asked that he be allowed to “shadow” another lieutenant for a couple of weeks if he were to receive the promotion. She stated on cross-examination that it would have been possible for plaintiff to brush up on DOC policies even though he was on military leave.', 'Ms. Getter stated that plaintiff’s military status did not affect her interview score, but she did acknowledge on cross-examination that she factored his absence from the DOC into her score. Specifically, she testified that she indicated in her interview notes that plaintiff was not', '- 10 - available for immediate service as a lieutenant in order to alert the pertinent officials in case the position required an immediate presence. Ms. Getter testified that, while plaintiff could have been promoted while on military leave, it was her belief that absence “should be a factor” in deciding whom to promote. She noted at trial that the individuals whom she scored higher had impressive computer skills and were knowledgeable about policies and procedures; she noted that one had even developed a “spork”13 utensil for the DOC, which saved money.', '2. The Testimony of Walter Whitman', 'The next witness, Walter Whitman, a former warden at the DOC, also served on the 2002 panel. At the time of trial he had retired from the DOC. He testified that all candidates for promotion were asked the same questions and that knowledge of departmental policies and procedures was the most important criterion assessed at the interview. He also corroborated Ms. Getter’s testimony that plaintiff arrived at the 2002 interview in his military uniform and suggested to the panel that, in view of federal law, his active military status should “have a positive impact on his candidacy for promotion.”', 'Mr. Whitman testified that, during the interview he concluded that plaintiff’s knowledge of policies and procedures was “average.” He further testified that plaintiff’s military leave status did not factor into the score he gave plaintiff on any of the questions. He also stated in his testimony, however, that he told plaintiff at the interview that plaintiff’s availability would have an impact and that plaintiff “may want to consider that before he [reached] the next level of interview[s].” Mr. Whitman further testified that availability would have an impact if he were making the decision because “practical matters” had to be taken into account; he acknowledged that he believed that holding a position 13', 'A “spork” is defined as “[a]n eating utensil having a spoonlike bowl and tines.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1692 (5th ed. 2011).', '- 11 - vacant for someone on leave would not be a “good management decision.” Mr. Whitman also stated that plaintiff’s military status would not be looked upon unfavorably, but he also stated that “there’s an operational consideration. His unavailability would have had an impact on his candidacy.” It is noteworthy, however, that the score recorded by Mr. Whitman was the highest score that plaintiff received from the members of the 2002 interview panel.', '3. The Testimony of Robert McCutcheon', 'Robert McCutcheon served on the 2001 interview panel. He testified that his own notes from the 2001 interview of Mr. Panarello stated: “Candidate gave an average interview.” Despite plaintiff’s “average” interview, Mr. McCutcheon scored only five candidates higher than plaintiff out of the twelve candidates interviewed. He testified that his notations at the interview indicated that plaintiff should not be promoted at that time but that he felt plaintiff would be a good candidate when he had “a little more time on the job.” It was Mr. McCutcheon’s testimony that his view that plaintiff should not be promoted at that time was not due to the fact that plaintiff was out on military leave.', '4. The Testimony of David Caruso', 'David Caruso was a deputy warden who sat on all three interview panels which evaluated plaintiff for promotion—in 2001, 2002, and 2007. At the time of trial, he had retired from the DOC. He testified that, when serving on an interview panel, he looked for some knowledge of DOC policies and procedures. When asked at trial if he had “chastised” plaintiff for wearing his military uniform to the 2001 interview, he replied: “Not to my recollection.” Mr. Caruso also testified that he did not remember anything particular about plaintiff’s appearance at the 2001 interview; he added that he did not remember making any comment at all about plaintiff’s appearance at that interview. Mr. Caruso stated at trial that some of the other candidates in 2001', '- 12 - and 2002 had a greater depth of knowledge than plaintiff, and he affirmed that plaintiff’s military leave status did not factor into the score that he submitted. Additionally, it was Mr. Caruso’s testimony that plaintiff was better prepared in 2007 and performed better at that interview than he had in his previous interviews. On cross-examination, Mr. Caruso acknowledged that the chairman of the 2001 panel, Tom Partridge, submitted seven names to the Director, and he also acknowledged that they were not the seven highest ranking interview candidates.', 'With respect to plaintiff’s performance at the 2001 interview, Mr. Caruso’s notes, which were a full exhibit at trial, state that plaintiff “lacked knowledge of minimum standards;” and, as to one question, the notes state that plaintiff “missed the most important points.” Mr. Caruso’s notes from the 2002 interview, when referring to plaintiff, read in pertinent part as follows: (1) “Does not appear to have prepared himself for a Correctional Lieutenants [sic] position — But he is however well versed for the military — Although there are similarities he should have put more effort in the position being sought;” and (2) “shallow in what he [thought] a lieutenant should do.” 14', '5. The Testimony of Cynthia Drake', 'The defendant also called Cynthia Drake, who was a DOC deputy warden both at the time of trial and when she served on the 2001 interview panel evaluating Mr. Panarello. It was her testimony that a successful candidate for promotion to the position of lieutenant “really needs to know policy [and] procedures [of the DOC].” Ms. Drake testified that plaintiff was dressed in his “fatigues” at the 2001 interview; but she stated that she did not consider his military status when deciding what score to award. She further testified that Mr. Panarello received a low score because his answers were not sufficiently complete. Ms. Drake also corroborated Mr. Caruso’s 14', 'In the passages from Mr. Caruso’s 2001 and 2002 interview notes quoted in the text, we have conformed the capitalization of letters.', '- 13 - testimony that the 2001 panel leader, Mr. Partridge, deviated from the interview rankings when recommending candidates to the Director.', '6. The Testimony of Silma-Del Langley and Sergio DeSousarosa', 'Silma-Del Langley and Sergio DeSousarosa, both of whom served on the 2007 interview panel, also testified. Ms. Langley testified that she had known plaintiff prior to the 2007 interview and that she observed a great improvement in plaintiff’s manner of thinking between the time when she worked with him in the early 2000s and when she worked with him again in 2006. She testified that her notes reflected her observation that plaintiff had reviewed DOC policies prior to the interview and that she had recommended him for promotion.', 'Mr. DeSousarosa asserted in his trial testimony that he did not factor plaintiff’s military status in his scoring of plaintiff’s interview.', '7. The Testimony of Ashbel T. Wall', 'Ashbel T. Wall, Director of the DOC, testified concerning the determination of whom to promote; he stated that he considers the scores of the candidates recommended by the interview panel, any comments on the interview forms, personnel records, absentee records, letters of recommendation, disciplinary records, résumés, and any other information that the candidate chooses to provide. However, he added that it is his practice to look at the interview score sheets and other information pertaining only to those individuals who were recommended by the interview panel. Director Wall stated in his testimony on cross-examination that interview panelists should not consider a candidate’s military status or military-related absence in the interview process, but he also acknowledged that he was not aware of any training at the DOC in 2001 or 2002 relative to discrimination against members of the military. Additionally, he', '- 14 - testified that the task of filling temporary “three-day rule” positions is left to the assistant director of the relevant division.', 'When questioned about the statement that he allegedly made to plaintiff at the Providence Place Mall, regarding his possibility of promotion while on military leave, Director Wall acknowledged that he did encounter plaintiff at the Mall, but he stated that he did not recall plaintiff asking about his chances of promotion. He added that he did not think that at that time he even knew that plaintiff was on military leave, and he stated that it would have been out of character for him to have made the alleged statement. Director Wall’s wife, Maria DeCarvalho, supported his testimony, stating that, while she did not remember the specific Providence Place Mall encounter with plaintiff, she could not recall any interaction with a DOC employee where Director Wall told the employee he or she would not be promoted while on military leave. Ms. DeCarvalho further testified that she would have been surprised to hear such a statement from her husband because he had expressed pride that the DOC is one of the largest sources of military personnel in Rhode Island.', 'C', 'The Superior Court’s Rulings', 'On January 22, 2009, the trial justice issued a preliminary decision in which she addressed certain matters relative to the instant case. In that decision, the trial justice ruled that the two-part burden-shifting paradigm, which was employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in its scholarly opinion in the case of Velázquez-García v. Horizon Lines of Puerto Rico, 473 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2007), articulated what she deemed to be the appropriate method for evaluating a case brought under the USERRA.', 'Specifically, the Velázquez-García analysis requires the employee alleging a violation of the USERRA to', '- 15 - demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her protected status was “a substantial or motivating factor” in the adverse employment action. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of proof then shifts to the employer to show, again by a preponderance of the evidence, that the adverse employment action would have been taken in the absence of the employee’s military service. Id. The trial justice concluded that this analytical approach should be employed with respect to plaintiff’s federal claims under the USERRA and also with respect to his parallel state claims.', 'Neither party disputes the pertinence of the Velázquez-García analytical approach. The dispute on appeal centers on the trial justice’s application of that analytical approach.', 'In the lengthy decision that she rendered on November 23, 2010, the trial justice considered the testimony of seventeen witnesses, forty exhibits, and the post-trial memoranda filed by the parties. She proceeded to find that Mr. Panarello had not met his burden of proving that his absence due to military service was “a substantial or motivating factor” in the DOC’s decision not to promote him to lieutenant in 2001 and 2002. Specifically, with respect to the evidence that Mr. Panarello produced which he contended was indicative of anti-military bias in the promotional process, she found that: (1) Director Wall’s testimony regarding his conversation with plaintiff at the Providence Place Mall was the more credible version of events; (2) David Caruso’s alleged comments regarding plaintiff’s military uniform at the 2001 interview were not demonstrative of bias; and (3) Walter Whitman’s comments regarding plaintiff’s availability, while “ill-advised,” did “not rise to the level needed to prove discrimination by the DOC * * * .” She held that there was no evidence that plaintiff’s unavailability due to military service affected the score that Mr. Whitman accorded him after the interview or that Mr. Whitman’s comments had any effect on the DOC officials (including', '- 16 - Director Wall) who were responsible for reviewing the interview results and conducting second interviews.', 'The trial justice further ruled that the DOC provided sufficient evidence to show: (1) that plaintiff was not one of the best candidates in 2001 and 2002; and (2) that he was a “much- improved” candidate in 2007. In 2001, according to the trial justice, the evidence showed that plaintiff was not sufficiently knowledgeable about DOC policies and procedures. The trial justice provided an example from the notes of Mr. Partridge, the chairperson of the 2001 interview panel; those notes state that Mr. Panarello had given a “shaky answer [and was] unsure where to proceed;” they further state that, with respect to a question about policies and procedures, plaintiff was “weak—not sure of answer. [V]ery broad * * * .” The trial justice also cited Mr. Caruso’s notes, which stated that Mr. Panarello “lacked knowledge in minimum standards” and “missed the most important points.”15 The trial justice further found that, by the time of the 2007 interview process, plaintiff had received a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and had studied DOC policies and procedures in more depth. In view of the just-referenced steps that plaintiff had taken to improve his fitness as a candidate, the trial justice ruled that the fact of plaintiff’s success in the 2007 process did not serve as proof that “the DOC improperly used bias in denying him promotion in 2001 and 2002.”', 'With regard to the temporary “three-day rule” promotion offered to Mr. Panarello in 2002, the trial justice found that a “three-day rule” position required immediate availability. She also faulted plaintiff for failing to provide any evidence that “three-day rule” positions were ever given to anyone on leave. Thus, she held that plaintiff had not met his burden of proving that his 15', 'In the passages quoted from the interview notes of Mr. Partridge and Mr. Caruso, we have conformed the capitalization of letters.', '- 17 - unavailability due to his military status was a consideration with respect to his appointment to a “three-day rule” position in a manner that violated the USERRA.', 'The plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When a trial justice presides over an action for declaratory judgment, the justice makes “all findings of fact without a jury.” Houde v. State, 973 A.2d 493, 498 (R.I. 2009). We have consistently held that our review of both a decision by the Superior Court granting or denying declaratory relief and “the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury is deferential.” Pelletier v.

Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009). A trial justice’s assessment of credibility is granted the same level of deference. Dowdell v. Bloomquist, 847 A.2d 827, 830 (R.I. 2004).', 'The trial justice’s factual findings and credibility determinations are given deferential review because they are made by “the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” In re Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 975 (R.I. 2006). We also accord deference to a trial justice’s “‘resolution of mixed questions of law and fact, as well as the inferences and conclusions drawn from the testimony and evidence * * * .’” Nye v.

However, in contrast to our deferential review of factual findings and credibility determinations, we conduct a de novo review of a trial justice’s “conclusions of law.” Gianquitti, 22 A.3d at 1165; Grady, 962 A.2d at 41.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Legal Framework', 'We commence our analysis by summarizing the relevant legal framework that will control our subsequent scrutiny of the trial justice’s findings of fact and her conclusions of law.', 'Traditionally, in employment discrimination cases, this Court has applied the “three-part burden-shifting paradigm set forth by the United States Supreme Court” in McDonnell Douglas', '- 19 - Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 280 (R.I. 2012). In such cases, we initially require a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case by proving four elements: (1) that plaintiff is “a member of the protected class * * * ; (2) [that plaintiff] applied for an open position; (3) [that plaintiff] was not selected; and (4) [that] the employer ‘filled the position by hiring another individual with similar qualifications.’”', 'Casey v. Town of Portsmouth, 861 A.2d 1032, 1037 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Gu v. Boston Police Department, 312 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2002)). Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, a rebuttable presumption arises that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the plaintiff, and the burden of production then “shifts” to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action at issue. McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280; Neri v. Ross-Simons, Inc., 897 A.2d 42, 49 (R.I. 2006). What “shifts” at this juncture is only the burden of production, not the burden of persuasion. McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280. If the employer satisfies this burden of production, the above-referenced presumption of discrimination “disappears.” Id. At that point, the burden of proof then “fall[s] * * * upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that [the employer’s] tendered explanation is only a pretext and that discrimination was the true motive underlying the hiring decision.” Id. at 280-81.', 'It is important to note, however, that plaintiff’s declaratory judgment claim in this case arose under the USERRA, which specifically addresses employment protections for members of the armed services. The USERRA provides that “[a] person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or', '- 20 - obligation.” 38 U.S.C. § 4311(a). The USERRA further reads in pertinent part: “An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited * * * under subsection (a), if the person’s membership, application for membership, service, application for service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer’s action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such membership, application for membership, service, application for service, or obligation for service * * * .”16 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)(1). When it enacted G.L. 1956 § 30-11-3(b), the General Assembly adopted all the protections of the USERRA for National Guard members on state active duty. 17 Consequently, the trial justice held that the traditional, McDonnell Doulgas three-part burden- shifting paradigm was not applicable to USERRA cases—a ruling which the parties do not contest on appeal.18 The burden-shifting paradigm to be applied in employment discrimination claims under the USERRA is an issue of first impression for this Court. In discussing the USERRA, its history, and the appropriate burden-shifting paradigm to be applied in USERRA cases, we have been enlightened and assisted by looking to the First Circuit’s thoroughly researched and well-reasoned decision in Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 17, for guidance, as did the trial justice. See generally Shoucair v. Brown University, 917 A.2d 418, 426 (R.I. 2007) 16', 'The USERRA has been analyzed and discussed in a scholarly article entitled From the Desert to the Courtroom: The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.

See also Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 16. In response to the decision in Monroe, Congress passed the USERRA. Id.

However, in our judgment, the trial justice in the instant case did not make such an error.', 'Initially, we must address plaintiff’s reading of Velázquez-García.', 'To support his argument that the wrong burden of proof was applied by the trial justice, Mr. Panarello avers that this case mirrors what actually transpired in Velázquez-García. The plaintiff in Velázquez- García, 473 F.3d at 14, had worked for an ocean shipping and transportation business. He alleged that he was fired because of his military status. Id. at 15. The district court granted summary judgment for the employer, but the First Circuit reversed, holding: (1) that the plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that his military service was a motivating factor in his dismissal; and (2) that the district court, despite having properly articulated the standard to be applied in a USERRA action, had erred when it “implicitly follow[ed] the McDonnell Douglas framework” in determining that, even if the plaintiff had met his initial burden, the employer had adequately demonstrated that it had a non-pretextual reason for the plaintiff’s firing. Id. at 15, 17, 20.', 'While we have adopted the First Circuit’s burden-shifting approach in Velázquez-García, we consider plaintiff’s suggestion that there is a parallel between the procedural travel of that case and the travel of the instant case to be fatally flawed. It must be emphasized that the First Circuit in Velázquez-García was reviewing the granting of a motion for summary judgment rather than a trial justice’s decision after a full bench trial. The trial justice in the instant case was tasked with determining whether plaintiff had shown by a preponderance of the evidence', '- 25 - that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the DOC’s failure to promote him and, in turn, whether the DOC had met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; by contrast, the district court in Velázquez-García, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, was required to determine whether there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the employer’s motivation in firing the plaintiff, and the district court was “constrained to perform this function without passing upon the weight or credibility of the evidence.” Reniere v. Gerlach, 752 A.2d 480, 482 (R.I. 2000); see also Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 15. Consequently, Velázquez-García is simply not instructive with respect to the civil procedure criteria that are pertinent to the instant case.', 'In order to properly analyze plaintiff’s contention that the trial justice improperly applied the USERRA burden-shifting paradigm, we must briefly discuss the legal framework relating to the employee’s substantial or motivating factor burden of proof. To meet the substantial or motivating factor test, a plaintiff “need not show that [military status] was the sole cause” of the employer’s actions, contrary to what plaintiff contends the trial justice required him to do, “but rather that it [was] one of the factors that a truthful employer would list if asked for the reasons for its decision.” Bunting v. Town of Ocean City, 409 F. App’x. 693, 695-96 (4th Cir. 2011); Petty, 538 F.3d at 446; see Bradberry v. Jefferson County, Texas, 732 F.3d 540, 545 (5th Cir. 2013); see also 20 C.F.R. § 1002.22 (2006) (“The individual has the burden of proving that a status or activity protected by USERRA was one of the reasons that the employer took action against him or her, in order to establish that the action was discrimination or retaliation in violation of USERRA.”). A plaintiff’s “[m]ilitary status is a motivating factor if the [employer] relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision on that consideration.” Coffman, 411 F.3d at 1238 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Petty, 538 F.3d at 446.', '- 26 - As the DOC points out, a USERRA claim cannot be supported by “bare assertions of discrimination.” See Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 480 F. App’x. 988, 990, 991-92 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Vega-Colon v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, 625 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that, in a USERRA action, an employee must “show evidence of discrimination other than the fact of non-selection and membership in the protected class”) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, discriminatory intent or motivation may be proven by either direct or circumstantial evidence; as one federal appellate court has stated, “Circumstantial evidence will often be a factor in [USERRA] cases, for discrimination is seldom open [and] notorious.” Sheehan, 240 F.3d at 1014. Other courts have held that discriminatory motivation on the part of an employer can be inferred from circumstantial evidence regarding the “proximity in time between the employee’s military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer’s expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee’s military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.” Id.; see also Coffman, 411 F.3d at 1238.', 'Several federal Circuit Courts of Appeal have held that, in determining whether an employee has proven that his or her military status was a substantial or motivating factor behind the employer’s conduct, a court may consider all record evidence, not merely that evidence which is supplied by the plaintiff; this includes the employer’s explanation for its actions. Maxfield v. Cintas Corp. No. 2, 427 F.3d 544, 552 (8th Cir. 2005); Leisek, 278 F.3d at 900; Sheehan, 240 F.3d at 1014. If the employee meets the substantial or motivating factor test, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show that it would have taken the same action regardless of the employee’s military status; that is to say, its stated reason for taking the adverse', '- 27 - employment action was not a pretext. See Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 17 (“[T]he employer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the stated reason was not a pretext * * * .”) (emphasis in original); see also Madden v. Rolls Royce Corp., 563 F.3d 636, 638 (7th Cir. 2009) (Posner, J.) (“All that is meant is that if the [employer] had two reasons for taking an adverse action against the [employee], one of them forbidden by [the USERRA] and the other not, and the [employer] can show that even if the forbidden one had been absent the adverse action would still have been taken, the [employee] loses.”).', 'The plaintiff argues, specifically, that the trial justice failed to properly apply the burden- shifting paradigm laid out in Velázquez-García when she erroneously kept the burden of persuasion on him at all times, requiring him to prove that the DOC’s legitimate reasons for not promoting him were pretextual. Additionally, plaintiff maintains that the trial justice erroneously required him to prove that discrimination was the “sole cause” of the DOC’s decisions not to promote him—rather than a substantial or motivating factor.23', 'The DOC, on the other hand, contends that the trial justice did not err in finding in the DOC’s favor. It asserts that the trial justice’s decision that plaintiff did not meet his burden of proof by showing that his military status was a substantial or motivating factor in the DOC’s failure to promote him was properly derived from her findings regarding witness credibility and the weight of the evidence. Additionally, the DOC references case law stating that “stray workplace remarks, as well as statements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus,” and it posits that plaintiff 23', 'The plaintiff makes a final argument that, if the trial justice had applied the proper burden-shifting paradigm, she would have found that plaintiff established a prima facie case of discrimination in violation of the USERRA.', '- 28 - failed to present evidence showing that the stray military-related remarks made by Mr. Whitman and Mr. Caruso were a substantial or motivating factor in the DOC’s ultimate decision not to promote plaintiff in 2001 and 2002.

Prudential Insurance Co. of America, 74 F.3d 323, 329 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Isolated, ambiguous remarks are insufficient, by themselves, to prove discriminatory intent.”); see generally Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).', 'Before turning to plaintiff’s specific contentions, we take this opportunity to offer guidance on the appropriate method of applying the Velázquez-García burden-shifting paradigm in future USERRA cases. The trial justice in the instant case stated that her ultimate conclusion was that plaintiff had not met his burden of showing that his military status and resulting unavailability were a substantial or motivating factor in the decisions not to promote him in 2001 and 2002. In her rescript opinion, the trial justice did not expressly indicate that she was applying the second part of the USERRA burden-shifting paradigm—namely, whether the employer can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the same action would have been taken despite the employee’s military status. Nevertheless, after carefully perusing that lengthy decision in its entirety, it has become clear to us that, while the trial justice explicitly referenced only the first part of the USERRA burden-shifting paradigm (the substantial or motivating factor test), in actuality her analysis encompassed both parts of the burden-shifting paradigm. It is also clear, as a matter of law, that the failure to explicitly discuss the two parts of the paradigm separately does not render the trial justice’s decision erroneous. See Sheehan, 240 F.3d at 1015 (“Although the [lower court] did not separate the discrimination determination into two discrete parts, for the first of which the complainant bears the burden of proof, and for the second of', '- 29 - which the employer bears the burden of proof, its decision as a whole followed the strictures of the framework developed [for USERRA actions].”). However, it is our definite view that, in future USERRA cases, it would be decidedly preferable that the two parts of the burden-shifting paradigm be assessed separately. This model would begin with an analysis of the evidence submitted by the employee and whether that evidence is sufficient to show, by a preponderance, that the employee’s military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer’s action; if the employee satisfies the first prong, the factfinder would then proceed to make an independent analysis of the remaining evidence and whether that evidence is sufficient to show, by a preponderance, that the employer has met its burden of proof by establishing that it would have taken the same action regardless of the employee’s military service. See Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 17.', 'That being said, we now proceed to plaintiff’s first contention regarding what he considers to be the trial justice’s inappropriate application of the USERRA burden-shifting paradigm. The plaintiff submits that the trial justice erred when she was, according to plaintiff, of the view that, if the DOC presented any evidence of a legitimate motive for not promoting plaintiff, then she was not required to consider whether his military status was also a factor; in other words, according to plaintiff, the trial justice required him to prove pretext and failed to require the DOC to prove lack of pretext. The plaintiff points specifically to the following statements by the trial justice: (1) “Plaintiff has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a superior candidate to those chosen for promotion in 2001 and 2002. That failure is a sufficient reason not to promote a candidate. Military service would not have to play a ‘substantial or motivating factor’ for the panels to make the decisions made in 2001 and 2002;” (2) “Plaintiff failed to show that his 2007 interview performance was equal to or worse than his', '- 30 - interview performances in 2001 and 2002;” and (3) “The DOC has provided sufficient evidence that Panarello was not the best candidate for the promotion in 2001 and 2002. Therefore, Panarello’s clothing did not have to come into consideration at all in the Department’s decision to promote candidates other than Panarello to Lieutenant in 2001 and 2002.” We agree with plaintiff that some of the statements made by the trial justice, when taken out of context, are less than felicitously worded.', 'However, the trial justice’s decision, when taken as a whole, demonstrates that she applied the appropriate burden of proof.', 'After laying out her findings of fact and the legal framework to be applied, the trial justice proceeded to discuss the motivating or substantial factor test with regard to plaintiff’s 2001 and 2002 interviews. She stated that plaintiff had “provided a series of gray facts that did not reach the level of ‘motivating or substantial factor’ in consideration of his promotion to lieutenant.” The trial justice did not fail to acknowledge Mr. Caruso’s statement regarding plaintiff’s uniform and what she characterized as Mr. Whitman’s “ill-advised” statements to plaintiff regarding his unavailability and its impact on his promotion, but she then proceeded to find that there was no evidence that Mr. Whitman had factored plaintiff’s unavailability into his score; and she also noted that plaintiff’s score was approximately at the average of the scores that Mr. Whitman gave to all the applicants. Moreover, she found: (1) that there was no evidence that Mr. Whitman’s views were considered at the time of the ultimate decision by Director Wall as to whom to promote; and (2) that Mr. Caruso’s statement was not “demonstrative of bias against [plaintiff’s] unavailability because of military obligations.”', 'Ultimately, based on the testimony of the interviewers regarding plaintiff’s qualifications, which the trial justice discussed in detail, and the trial justice’s own credibility determinations, she held that plaintiff had not been promoted because he was less qualified than those individuals', '- 31 - who were selected for promotion—and not because of (even partly) his military status. See Mock v. Rome, 910 F. Supp. 2d 429, 432 (N.D.N.Y. 2012) (denying a plaintiff’s motion for a judgment as a matter of law after a jury verdict in favor of the employer in a USERRA action because a jury could have concluded, after making credibility determinations, that the employer chose other individuals “more qualified and better suited for the position[]”). The trial justice also gave credence to the testimony that illustrated how significantly improved plaintiff as a candidate was in 2007, when he was ultimately promoted; and, taking that into account, she found that his promotion after his return from military leave was not evidence that he was not promoted in 2001 and 2002 due to his military unavailability. Thus, after ruling that Director Wall’s testimony regarding his encounter with Mr. Panarello in 2000 was credible and weighing the previously discussed statements by certain panel members in 2001 and 2002 against all the other evidence on the record, especially the voluminous evidence tending to show that plaintiff was not the most qualified candidate for promotion in 2001 or 2002, the trial justice ruled that plaintiff had not met his burden. In the trial justice’s statements, contested by plaintiff, regarding her determination that he had not provided any evidence to rebut the voluminous evidence that he was not the most qualified for promotion in 2001 and 2002, the trial justice was not, as plaintiff contends, improperly requiring him to prove pretext; she was appropriately taking all the evidence on the record, from both parties, into account in making her conclusion. See Leisek, 278 F.3d at 900; Sheehan, 240 F.3d at 1014. We are unable to perceive any error in the trial justice’s ultimate conclusion that plaintiff could not prevail on his USERRA claim.', 'The plaintiff further contends that, since the trial justice found that military absence was referenced by some of the members of the 2001 and 2002 interview panels (specifically Mr. Whitman, Ms. Getter, and Mr. Caruso), the trial justice erred in then finding that Mr. Panarello', '- 32 - had not met his burden. He asserts that the USERRA prohibits any consideration of military unavailability; and he also contends that the USERRA burden-shifting paradigm does not require a consideration of military unavailability to be the sole factor in the decision to promote him, but rather only a factor in the decision. While plaintiff correctly asserts that the “USERRA is not a sole motive test,” his approach to the standard seems to, in effect, remove the language “substantial or motivating” from the burden of proof that he must meet. See Petty, 538 F.3d at 446 (holding that for military service to have been “[a] motivating factor does not mean that it had to be the sole cause of the employment action [rather it had to be] one of the factors that a truthful employer would list if asked for the reasons for its decision”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff takes the position that, if his military service or unavailability were taken into account by any individual playing a role in the promotional process, then the requirements of the USERRA have been met. However, we would reiterate that the first prong of the two-part paradigm clearly requires that the plaintiff demonstrate that his military status was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer’s decision. See Velázquez-García, 473 F.3d at 17. It does not suffice for an employee to simply show that his military status was mentioned or noted by someone in the promotional process. Id. Consequently, as we have already articulated, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in her application of the USERRA burden-shifting paradigm to the facts of the instant case regarding the 2001 and 2002 interview processes. The plaintiff has additionally contended that the trial justice erred when she failed to conclude that there was a causal nexus between the allegedly tainted promotional process and Director Wall’s ultimate decision as to whom to promote. Given the conclusions we have already reached in this opinion, we need not delve into that contention.', '- 33 -', '2. The “Three-Day Rule” Position', 'The plaintiff further contends that there is error in the trial justice’s analysis of the “three- day rule” issue. 24 He contends that the trial justice made a factual error in concluding that availability was a legitimate factor in the filling of this temporary position. He further argues that, because unavailability is never a permissible consideration under the USERRA, the trial justice made a legal error in finding that the DOC could permissibly withdraw the position based on plaintiff’s unavailability.', 'Mr. Panarello points out: (1) that he was willing to leave his military position to take the “three-day rule” position; (2) that, despite not giving him the position because he was unavailable, the position was not officially filled until October of 2002; and (3) that Director Wall testified that he would not have an issue with giving a “three-day rule” position to a person on military leave. On appeal, the DOC does not challenge the fact that plaintiff was not awarded the “three-day rule” position because of his military unavailability. However, it contends that a prerequisite for someone to be appointed to such a position was that that individual be available to start immediately.', 'The trial justice held that the DOC presented credible evidence that the “three-day rule” position required immediate availability; she specifically cited the testimony of Mr. Truman— “when there’s a known vacancy for an extended period of time and an agency desires to fill that position while that person is away, it can be done by taking someone of lower rank and placing [him or her] into that position.” The trial justice further referenced the fact that plaintiff had not demonstrated that “three-day rule” positions were never given to individuals on military leave. Upon review of the trial testimony and the trial justice’s decision, we conclude that there was no error, either factual or legal, in her decision. 24', 'The rather arcane dispute about the “three-day rule” position is explained in detail in our summary of the testimony of George Truman, Jr. in Part I.A.1, supra.', '- 34 -', 'Contrary to plaintiff’s contention, there was adequate evidence for the trial justice to determine that immediate availability was a prerequisite for appointment to a “three-day rule” position. In addition to the above-quoted testimony which the trial justice credited, Mr. Truman also acknowledged that availability was a “prerequisite to a [‘three-day rule’] job[.]” He further testified that, when filling a “three-day rule” position, the DOC is “not planning for the future, [but it is] planning for next weekend and forward.”', 'It was well within the trial justice’s discretion to find Mr. Truman’s testimony about the “three-day rule” position the more credible or complete evidence and, thus, find that immediate availability was a “basic requirement” of a “three-day rule” position. See Cahill, 11 A.3d at 86 (holding that this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s factual findings after a bench trial unless they are “clearly erroneous or * * * the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence”).', 'Even if the “three-day rule” position was not actually filled until October of 2002, as plaintiff testified, and a “three-day rule” position could be given to someone on military leave, as Director Wall testified, we do not deem that to constitute evidence of discrimination, especially in light of the trial justice’s finding that a “three-day rule” position requires immediate availability. Thus, we detect no factual error in the trial justice’s decision.', 'We are similarly not swayed by plaintiff’s contention that the trial justice committed an error of law in finding that unavailability was a permissible consideration when filling a temporary position under the USERRA. While an employer may not discriminate based on military unavailability during a general promotional process, common sense dictates that this rule simply should not apply to a temporary position. See State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1159 (R.I. 2005) (mem.) (“‘That seems to us to be the common sense of the matter; and common sense often makes good law.’”) (quoting Peak v. United States, 353 U.S. 43, 46 (1957)); see also', '- 35 - State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 476 n. 51 (R.I. 2008). In the first place, the trial justice found that the DOC required immediate availability for a “three-day rule” position. Accordingly, anyone who was not immediately available would not be awarded the position, regardless of the reason for his or her unavailability; therefore, the same prerequisites were applied to every applicant. Moreover, it would put an impossible burden on employers if they were required to wait weeks or months to fill a temporary position that involves only six months of service. We do not construe the USERRA to require such an exercise in inefficiency, nor do we perceive any error in the trial justice’s similar conclusion.', 'Consequently, we find no error in the trial justice’s determination that the DOC did not violate the USERRA by not awarding Mr. Panarello the “three-day rule” position.', 'C', 'The Trial Justice’s Review of the Evidence', 'Mr. Panarello’s final contention is that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in reaching her decision, thus necessitating a reversal. Specifically, he refers to: (1) evidence of similarly situated correctional officers (namely, Joseph Forgue, Jr. and John Lavery), who plaintiff contends were also victims of discrimination; 25 (2) a memorandum in evidence written from Tom Partridge, the chairperson of the 2001 interview panel, to Albert Gardner, an assistant director at the DOC, which was ultimately forwarded to Director Wall;26 25', 'Mr. Forgue and Mr. Lavery testified at trial regarding the discrimination that they allegedly suffered based on their military status, while in the employ of the DOC. See Part I.A.3, supra. 26', 'The memorandum from Mr. Partridge to Mr. Gardner that is referenced in the text is dated March 2, 2001; it was entered into evidence at the trial. It indicates that the following were the reasons for not recommending a particular corrections officer (not plaintiff) for promotion: “Presently on Workman’s [sic] Compensation. * * * The needs of this Department are immediate', '- 36 - (3) the testimony of Ms. Getter regarding her alleged bias against plaintiff because he was on military leave; 27 (4) evidence relating to the promotion of Correctional Officer Shayne Chapman;28 (5) notes made by Mr. Caruso during the 2002 interview;29 and (6) the fact that, according to plaintiff, Mr. Whitman’s statements at the panel interview in 2002 and at trial were “illegal per se.”30', 'As is our consistent practice in reviewing a jury-waived trial, we will not disturb the trial justice’s factual findings unless they are “clearly erroneous or * * * the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence * * * .” Cahill, 11 A.3d at 86. With the exception of the statements of Mr. Whitman, the evidence which plaintiff contends was overlooked or misconceived was not specifically alluded to by the trial justice in her decision. However, the fact that she did not expressly reference every last bit of the evidence is certainly not determinative of the issue. The trial justice need only discuss sufficient evidence for it to be clear to this Court that the standard applied was appropriate. In our judgment, the trial justice in * * * .” Before forwarding the memorandum to Director Wall, Mr. Gardner added the following handwritten note (some punctuation and capitalization having been modified by us):', '“I agree with the reasoning about not recommending [a named', 'candidate].

[A second named candidate]', 'could be a good choice but not while on Comp. we still need LTs', 'that can be used on Line now.” (Emphasis in original.) 27', 'See Part I.B.1, supra. 28', 'Mr. Chapman was promoted to lieutenant while on military leave, after the DOC received USERRA training in 2006. His rank after the panel interview in 2006 was similar to Mr. Panarello’s rank in 2002: Mr. Chapman was ranked fifth out of eight candidates, and Mr. Panarello had been ranked fifth out of seven candidates. Mr. Chapman was recommended for a second interview and then promoted, despite having given a poor answer on a question regarding DOC policy. 29', 'See Part I.B.4, supra. 30', 'See Part I.B.2, supra.', '- 37 - this case carried out her fact-finding responsibilities in an assiduous and meticulous manner; and, given the applicable standard of review, we perceive absolutely no basis for disturbing her findings. The trial justice clearly reviewed all the evidence, both testimonial and documentary, before rendering her decision. That decision explicitly states:', '“Plaintiff presented twenty-one exhibits and the DOC submitted', 'nineteen exhibits to this [c]ourt. The [c]ourt heard testimony of', 'seventeen witnesses. Subsequent to trial, both parties submitted', 'post-trial memoranda. Based on the testimony and evidence, this', '[c]ourt makes the following findings.” Reasonableness is the watchword in this domain, and we are entirely satisfied that the trial justice in this case did not in any meaningful way overlook or misconceive evidence such that a new trial should be granted. See Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d at 476 n. 51.', 'Lastly, the testimony of Mr. Whitman was specifically discussed by the trial justice. The plaintiff argues that the statements of Mr. Whitman, regarding plaintiff’s unavailability and its impact on his chances for promotion were, in his words, “discriminatory per se” and “per se illegal”—something, which plaintiff submits was overlooked by the trial justice. 31 However, even assuming arguendo that the statements were “discriminatory per se,” that would not mean that the statements were “per se illegal” or that plaintiff had thereby met his burden of proof under the USERRA; he was required to show that his military status was not merely a factor, but a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to promote him. Such regrettable statements by a single panelist (which the trial justice characterized as “ill-advised”) do not necessarily mean that plaintiff’s military status and unavailability were a substantial or motivating factor in 31', 'It should be noted that the trial justice found that Mr. Whitman’s comments did not prove discrimination by the DOC because they were not “blatantly discriminatory.” The plaintiff challenges the applicability of a “blatantly discriminatory” standard. However, even if we assume that the statements were “discriminatory per se,” as plaintiff urges, we still conclude that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the evidence; Mr. Whitman’s statements were properly considered by the trial justice during her analysis and weighing of the evidence.', '- 38 - the ultimate decision about promotion. Thus, we perceive no indication that the trial justice misconceived Mr. Whitman’s testimony. Moreover, the trial justice clearly took Mr. Whitman’s comments into account when weighing the evidence and determining whether the DOC had discriminated against plaintiff in violation of the USERRA.

These consolidated cases came before this Court on cross-appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and denying the defendants’ request for sanctions against the plaintiffs. In the first of these cases, the plaintiffs claim that the hearing justice erred in granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss because the appeal process set forth in G.L. 1956 § 44-5-26 is not applicable to sewer assessments. In their cross-appeal, the defendants contend that their request for sanctions against the plaintiffs should have been considered and granted by the hearing justice because of the plaintiffs’ various duplicative and frivolous filings. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated in part and affirmed in part.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'These consolidated cases concern only one of a series of substantially similar cases 1 which have been filed by one or more of the plaintiffs involved in this appeal challenging the legality of sewer assessments assessed by the Town of Coventry (defendants or Coventry). 2', 'The plaintiffs, Commerce Park Associates 1, LLC; Commerce Park Associates 2, LLC; Commerce Park Associates 6, LLC; Commerce Park Associates 13, LLC; Commerce Park Properties, LLC; Commerce Park Realty, LLC; Commerce Park Realty 2, LLC; and Commerce Park Management, LLC (collectively plaintiffs or Commerce Park) are all limited liability entities in the state of Rhode Island and managed by Nicholas Cambio, Vincent Cambio, and Melissa Faria. The plaintiffs own real property in Coventry, known as the Centre of New England. The sewer assessments for the Centre of New England properties are at the heart of this appeal.', 'On or about October 18, 2011, Commerce Park received notices of sale of their properties for nonpayment of sewer assessments from Coventry. The notices indicated that the nonpayment of the sewer assessments would result in a tax sale process, scheduled for January 24, 2012.', 'Thereafter, on November 29, 2011, Commerce Park filed suit in the Kent County Superior Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the legality of the sewer 1', 'See, for example, Commerce Park Associates 1, LLC et al. v.

The defendants also asked the Superior Court to determine whether the various Commerce Park filings had been made “in good faith” and “take such further action as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances,” which both defendants and the hearing justice interpreted as a request for sanctions under Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'The motion came before the Washington County Superior Court 4 for oral argument, and the hearing justice issued a bench decision on December 15, 2011. The hearing justice limited his consideration of the motion to dismiss to the four corners of the instant complaint, but he did note that another largely similar action was pending in the Kent County Superior Court 5 at the time.

Minardi, 21 A.3d 274 (R.I. 2011), to explain that the appeal process of § 44-5-26 “applies to all tax assessment cases.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion to dismiss due to plaintiffs’ failure to follow the correct administrative appeal process.', 'He further stated “the [c]ourt has determined it will not proceed on any applications for sanctions * * *.” An order to that effect was entered on December 21, 2011. 6', 'The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to this Court on December 28, 2011.', 'The defendants filed a cross-appeal on the denial of their request for sanctions on January 3, 2012. The appeals were consolidated by this Court on January 9, 2013. 7', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue, first, that they have already exhausted their administrative remedies because they appealed Coventry’s sewer assessments to the sewer assessment board of review and were denied. 8 The plaintiffs also argue that the appeal process in § 44-5-26 applies to annual real estate taxes but does not apply to Coventry’s sewer “betterment” assessments.', 'The defendants contend, in turn, that the hearing justice erred in not considering the sanctions sought by Coventry in addressing the motion to dismiss.

The enabling act granted to Coventry the authority to construct, finance, and operate a sewer system. 10 See P.L. 1997, ch. 330, § 1. The town council was permitted to establish and construct a sewer system for the Town of Coventry and to “prescribe just and equitable sewer assessment rates on account of the construction costs * * * and also rates of annual charge, on account of operating and maintenance costs, to be levied against owners of property which is connected to a common sewer.” P.L. 1997, ch. 330, § 9.

Section 19 of the enabling act established 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-5-26(a) provides that “[a]ny person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any assessment of taxes against him or her in any city or town * * * may * * * file an appeal in the local office of tax assessment * * *. The taxpayer, if still aggrieved, may appeal the decision of the tax assessor to the local tax board of review * * *.” 10', 'The first version of the enabling act was passed by the General Assembly in 1970 by Public Laws 1970, chapter 175. It has been amended several times since then, most recently in 2006. The parties do not dispute that the version of the enabling act which is applicable to the instant matter is Public Laws 1997, chapter 330. Accordingly, all references to the Coventry sewer enabling act will be from the 1997 iteration of it.', '-6- a sewer board of review, consisting of members appointed by the town council, and set forth the following procedure for appeals of any assessments or charges levied by the town for the sewer system:', '“Within sixty (60) days after mailing of notice of an assessment or', 'charges [for construction and maintenance of the sewer system] * *', '*, any person aggrieved by such assessment, charge or order may', 'appeal to the sewer board of review.', '“The sewer board of review shall keep an accurate record of its', 'proceedings which shall be available for public inspection.', '“If the board determines that such assessment[,] charge or order is', 'unwarranted in whole or in part, it shall annul or modify the same', 'and make such order as justice may require. Otherwise it shall', 'affirm the same. Within thirty (30) days after the decision of the', 'sewer board of review, any party aggrieved, which may include the', 'council, may appeal to the superior court which shall have the', 'same powers to annul, modify, enter further orders or affirm as the', 'sewer board of review.” P.L. 1997, ch. 330, § 19.', 'The hearing justice determined that plaintiffs were attempting to challenge the legality of sewer taxes and that accordingly their challenge must follow the administrative appeal process outlined in § 44-5-26. He cited to authority from this Court for the conclusion that “the taxing statute provide[s] the exclusive relief to any person aggrieved by any assessment of taxes against him in any city or town.” He further determined that plaintiffs had not met the burden of establishing that they were challenging the legality of their taxes so as to permit them to proceed directly to the Superior Court under the taxing statute. 11', 'We do not take issue with the hearing justice’s conclusion that previous authority from this Court has definitively stated that the process set forth in § 44-5-26 is the exclusive remedy 11', 'Section 44-5-27 provides that a person challenging an illegal tax against him or her may skip the process of appealing to the local assessor and proceed directly to the Superior Court by invoking the court’s equity jurisdiction. See also Narragansett Electric Co. v. Minardi, 21 A.3d 274, 278 (R.I. 2011).', '-7- for any taxpayer challenging a local tax. We are convinced, however, that the process set forth in § 44-5-26 is not applicable to the instant case. This Court has previously noted that “sewer charges are not ordinarily to be considered a tax.” Newport Court Club Associates v. Town Council of Middletown, 716 A.2d 787, 790 (R.I. 1998) (citing Costello v. Ricci, 121 R.I. 509, 512, 401 A.2d 38, 40 (1979)). In Costello, this Court considered annual sewer use charges levied by the North Providence Town Council and concluded that, because annual sewer use charges are generally not considered to be taxes, “statutes relating to taxation are inapposite in the present case.” Costello, 121 R.I. at 512, 401 A.2d at 40. We recognize that the instant case is not limited to annual sewer use charges such as were at issue in Costello but also relates to sewer assessments for the construction of the sewer system. We believe, however, that this distinction is immaterial for the purposes of determining whether the taxing statute of chapter 5 of title 44 applies. Whether sewer assessments are applied to construction charges or to ordinary maintenance charges has generally not been viewed as a meaningful distinction. See 11 Eugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations § 31:32 at 366-67 and 372-73 (Rev. 3d ed. 2010) (noting that sewer charges and fees are not ordinarily treated as taxes and that such fees may be used to defray construction costs and expenses).', 'We turn now to the language of the Coventry enabling act to determine if the sewer assessments levied by the town pursuant to the enabling act were, in fact, intended to be treated as taxes so as to fall within the purview of chapter 5 of title 44. We find it significant that the enabling act consistently refers to the means of raising funds in order to cover the cost of construction and maintenance of the sewer system as “assessments” and “annual charges,” respectively. See P.L. 1997, ch. 330, §§ 1, 9. In particular, § 9 of the enabling act specifically distinguishes between the portion of the cost of construction and maintenance of the sewage', '-8- works which will be paid for by the town through its “general taxation” and the portion which will be paid for “by assessments and annual charges against individual parcels of property,” such as the assessments being challenged by plaintiffs here. See P.L. 1997, ch. 330, § 9. Only once does the enabling act equate the assessments and charges levied by the town with taxes, in generally stating that unpaid sewer assessments or charges “shall be collected in the same manner that taxes assessed on real estate are by law collected.” Id. We note that the fact that the General Assembly deemed it necessary to state that assessments and charges were to be treated as taxes for purposes of collection appears to indicate that the General Assembly recognized that the assessments and charges were not taxes for other purposes. See Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 279 (R.I. 2004) (“We presume that the General Assembly intended to attach significance to every word, sentence[,] and provision of a statute.”). More significantly, § 19 of the enabling act, which established the process by which property owners may challenge sewer assessments levied upon them, does not include any reference to taxes in general or to the tax appeal process in chapter 5 of title 44. As a general rule, we will not read into a statute a requirement that the drafters omitted. Iadevaia v. Town of Scituate Zoning Board of Review, 80 A.3d 864, 875 (R.I. 2013); see also Woods v. Safeway System, Inc., 102 R.I. 493, 495, 232 A.2d 121, 122 (1967) (“Unless there are compelling reasons for us to do so, we should not by implication read into the statute what the [L]egislature has not expressed.”) (quoting Adelson v. McKenna, 55 R.I. 363, 365, 181 A. 799, 800 (1935)). Accordingly, we decline to read into a simple statement of a right to appeal to the Superior Court an intention on the part of the General Assembly to mandate that sewer assessments and charges are to be treated as real estate taxes for appeal purposes or, more specifically, that appeals under § 19 of the enabling act, P.L. 1997, ch. 330, must follow the', '-9- process of § 44-5-26. See generally 2A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 46:6 at 251-52 (7th ed. Norman J. Singer 2007) (stating that, “where the legislature has employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded”). We conclude that the sewer assessments at issue in the instant matter are not taxes and that, accordingly, the tax appeal process in chapter 5 of title 44 is inapplicable. We therefore hold that the hearing justice erred in granting defendants’ motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs had not followed the § 44-5-26 tax appeal process. We further hold that the appeal process set forth in § 19 of P.L. 1997, ch. 330 is the only process by which residents of Coventry may appeal any sewer assessments or charges levied by the town pursuant to its authority under the enabling act, including the assessments being challenged by plaintiffs here.', 'The plaintiffs argue that they have, in fact, already followed the correct procedure by bringing their claims to the Coventry Sewer Assessment Board of Review, as provided for in § 19 of P.L. 1997, ch. 330, and then by filing an appeal to the Kent County Superior Court in a petition docketed as C.A. No. KM 08-262. Because we conclude that the hearing justice erred in finding that the process set forth in § 44-5-26 applied, we need not, and do not, reach the issue of whether plaintiffs’ prior actions in filing suit in the Superior Court satisfied the requirements of the appeal process of § 19 of the enabling act, P.L. 1997, ch. 330. On remand, we direct the Superior Court to conduct a hearing as to whether plaintiffs had already followed the correct procedure in their 2008 complaint and to determine what effect, if any, the pendency of the 2008 complaint should have on the disposition of the instant case. 12 12', 'We note that the interests of judicial economy and efficiency appear to dictate that the various cases pending in the Superior Court between Commerce Park and Coventry related to the sewer assessments for the Centre of New England properties should, to the extent they remain viable causes of action, be consolidated into one action in order to resolve all outstanding issues between the parties.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'Sanctions', 'The defendants take issue with the hearing justice’s denial of their request for sanctions without hearing argument on the issue. In addition, defendants argue that plaintiffs have misused the judicial process by filing multiple suits in the Superior Court all making essentially the same argument, thereby exposing Coventry to the danger of different legal results in different cases on the same issue.', 'The plaintiffs, in contrast, contend that the instant action was valid and necessary because they were entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent the sale of their property.', 'Rule 11 grants trial courts considerable discretion in their decision to impose sanctions against attorneys for any violation of the rules. See Michalopoulos v. C & D Restaurant, Inc., 847 A.2d 294, 300 (R.I. 2004). “[T]his Court will not reverse a trial justice’s imposition [or denial] of sanctions for a litigant’s misconduct unless the trial court based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” In re Briggs, 62 A.3d at 1098-99 (quoting Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 918 A.2d 213, 217 (R.I. 2007)).', 'Here, the hearing justice summarily determined not to grant the defendants’ request for sanctions. While the lack of a record on the issue of sanctions necessarily limits our ability to review it, we note that the hearing justice evinced an awareness of the pendency in Superior Court of the several other actions between these parties concerning sewer assessments, which constituted the basis of the defendants’ request for sanctions. The defendants insist that the hearing justice erred in specifically limiting his consideration to the four corners of the instant complaint and thereby ignoring the other pending actions. We conclude that this argument lacks merit as his decision explicitly stated that the limited consideration was solely on the issue of the', '- 11 - motion to dismiss. The hearing justice did not specifically limit his decision on sanctions to the four corners of the instant complaint. We will not assume error on the hearing justice’s part without any basis in the record. In addition, it was the hearing justice’s prerogative to determine if further argument on the issue of sanctions was necessary. Moreover, we cannot conclude that he abused his discretion or was otherwise clearly wrong in declining to impose sanctions on the plaintiffs. Accordingly, we will not disturb the hearing justice’s denial of the defendants’ request for sanctions.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss is vacated.

Cohen (defendant or Cohen). 1 This case came before the Supreme Court on March 4, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing their written submissions, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Ellinwood’s wife and three children appeal from the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment on their claims for loss of consortium and loss of companionship. Since their derivative claims are dependent on Kris Ellinwood’s negligence claim, we refer to the lead plaintiff Kris Ellinwood as “plaintiff” for purposes of simplicity.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The pertinent facts in this matter are not contested. On the morning of December 23, 2009, Ellinwood, a patrolman with the East Providence Police Department, was directing traffic on Roger Williams Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island. Ellinwood was part of a three- person police detail assigned to a tree-cutting project that had commenced at approximately 7:30 that morning. To assist with the tree removal, a large crane was positioned in the northbound lane of Roger Williams Avenue, leaving only the southbound lane open for travel. Ellinwood and a fellow police officer were controlling the flow of traffic to ensure that vehicles coming from both directions could safely navigate around the crane.', 'Sometime around 8 a.m., the tree-removal work forced Antonio Soares to bring his vehicle to a complete stop in the southbound lane, approximately 120 to 500 feet north of the crane. The defendant, on his way to drop off his son at daycare, was also traveling southward on Roger Williams Avenue at that time. With his vision temporarily impaired by the glare from the morning sun, defendant did not see Mr. Soares’ stopped vehicle. The defendant’s vehicle collided with the rear of Mr. Soares’ vehicle. Although the force of the collision was sufficient to cause the airbag in defendant’s vehicle to deploy, no one sustained injuries in the accident.', 'After exiting his car, defendant noticed Ellinwood further up the road and motioned for Ellinwood to approach. Ellinwood asked if anyone had been injured but did not question defendant about the cause of the accident. The defendant assured Ellinwood that everyone was unharmed. He did not mention the sun glare.', 'Ellinwood then attempted to collect Mr. Soares’ and defendant’s insurance and registration information. Since defendant was holding his son in his arms, Ellinwood retrieved', '-2- defendant’s papers for him by reaching into the front driver’s side of defendant’s vehicle. With defendant’s papers in hand, Ellinwood started to walk around the front of defendant’s vehicle towards the passenger’s side of Mr. Soares’ vehicle. In between the hood of defendant’s vehicle and the trunk of Mr. Soares’ vehicle, Ellinwood paused to write down some of the information.', 'At that moment, Andrew Thornley was driving southward, toward the scene of the accident, on Roger Williams Avenue. Due to solar glare, Mr. Thornley did not see defendant’s vehicle. Mr. Thornley’s vehicle struck the rear of defendant’s vehicle, causing Ellinwood to be pinned in between the front of defendant’s vehicle and the rear of Mr. Soares’ vehicle. Ellinwood’s lower legs were essentially crushed.', 'As a result of the accident, he suffered multiple severe fractures in his lower legs, fractured both ankles, and sustained damage to his knees.', 'Ellinwood commenced a negligence action against Cohen in Providence County Superior Court on November 5, 2010. 2 In his complaint, Ellinwood alleged that defendant negligently failed to warn him of a dangerous condition, to wit, solar glare.', 'Thereafter, Cohen moved for summary judgment. In support of his motion, defendant argued that the so-called “public-safety officer’s rule” barred Ellinwood from recovering. According to defendant, the risk of being injured by another vehicle is one that a police officer would typically encounter when responding to the scene of an automobile accident on a public roadway.', 'The plaintiff objected to defendant’s motion. According to Ellinwood, he could not have reasonably anticipated the specific risk posed by the solar glare.', 'Ellinwood asserted that 2', 'Stanley Tree Service, Inc., National Grid, and Mr. Thornley were also named as defendants in plaintiff’s complaint. All of plaintiff’s claims against these three defendants were eventually dismissed by agreement of the parties.', '-3- defendant’s failure to warn him that the sun was blinding drivers in the southbound lane precluded the application of the public-safety officer’s rule.', 'In a decision rendered on March 27, 2012, a Superior Court hearing justice agreed with defendant that the public-safety officer’s rule shielded defendant from liability. The hearing justice concluded that “[t]he risk * * * created by * * * Cohen[] was * * * certainly a foreseeable risk that would be encountered by a police officer in these situations.” Accordingly, he granted Cohen’s motion for summary judgment. An order to that effect entered on March 30, 2012.

Milner, 42 A.3d 1245, 1251 (R.I. 2012). 3', 'The hearing justice delayed entering final judgment in Cohen’s favor until after plaintiff had dismissed his remaining claims against the other defendants.', '-4-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Ellinwood argues that the hearing justice erred in concluding that the public- safety officer’s rule barred him from recovering on his negligence claim against Cohen. “[T]he public-safety officer’s rule ‘bar[s] an injured public–safety official from maintaining a negligence action against a tortfeasor whose alleged malfeasance is responsible for bringing the officer to the scene of a fire, crime, or other emergency where the officer is injured.’” 4 Higgins v. Rhode Island Hospital, 35 A.3d 919, 922-23 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Labrie v. Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc., 678 A.2d 867, 868 (R.I. 1996)). To be shielded from liability under the public- safety officer’s rule, the defendant, or alleged tortfeasor, must establish three elements:', '“(1) that the tortfeasor injured the police officer * * * in the course', 'of [the officer’s] employment,', '“(2) that the risk the tortfeasor created was the type of risk that one', 'could reasonably anticipate would arise in the dangerous situation', 'which [the police officer’s] employment requires [him or her] to', 'encounter, and', '“(3) that the tortfeasor is the individual who created the dangerous', 'situation which brought the police officer * * * to the * * *', 'accident scene * * *.” Id. at 923 (quoting Rinn v. Razee, 912 A.2d', '939, 940 (R.I. 2006) (mem.)).', 'In the instant case, there is no dispute that Ellinwood was injured in the course of performing his duties as a police officer. The parties also agree that Cohen caused the situation which brought Ellinwood to the scene of the accident. Instead, plaintiff essentially asserts that 4', 'Originally known as the “firefighter’s rule” or “fireman’s rule,” this common law doctrine has more recently been referred to in our case law as the “public-safety officer’s rule,” see Rinn v. Razee, 912 A.2d 939, 939 n.1 (R.I. 2006) (mem.), and in some jurisdictions as the “professional rescuers” doctrine. See Restatement (Third) Torts § 51 cmt. m (2012). Regardless of its appellation, the rule applies to police officers. See Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Vierra, 619 A.2d 436, 439 (R.I. 1993).', '-5- the second element has not been met because the injury in this case was from an unforeseeable risk. He also makes a distinct but similar argument that this case falls within an exception to the public-safety officer’s rule because Cohen failed to warn him of an unknown particularized danger. We address each of plaintiff’s arguments separately.', 'A', 'Element of Foreseeability', 'Ellinwood argues that the hearing justice erred in concluding that the risk which resulted in his injuries was one that a police officer would foreseeably encounter when placed in a situation such as the one in which Ellinwood found himself. Ellinwood asserts that he could not have known or foreseen that Cohen had waved him into a zone of danger. According to Ellinwood, that zone of danger was created by the solar glare.', 'In making such an argument, plaintiff takes a mistakenly narrow view of the scope of the public-safety officer’s rule. He suggested below, and reiterates on appeal, that foreseeable risks when responding to a roadside accident would include slipping on antifreeze from a damaged radiator or injuring himself on a bent fender but do not include the specific accident that resulted in his injuries. Ellinwood is correct that the rule does not require public-safety officers to “assume every possible risk which they may confront in their work.” Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Vierra, 619 A.2d 436, 438 (R.I. 1993). On the other hand, the immunity afforded by the rule is not limited to only those risks which arise directly from the negligence that brought the police officer to the scene.', 'As we have explained, one of the rationales for immunizing tortfeasors under the public-safety officer’s rule is the doctrine of primary assumption of risk. 5 5', 'The other equally, if not more important, rationale for the public-safety officer’s rule derives from public policy considerations and “fundamental concepts of justice.” Higgins v. Rhode Island Hospital, 35 A.3d 919, 925 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Vierra, 619 A.2d at 438). “[P]olice', '-6- Under this doctrine, public-safety officers “are deemed as a matter of law, [to] assume all normal risks inherent in their duties when they accept their positions * * *.” Higgins, 35 A.3d at 925 (quoting Day v. Caslowitz, 713 A.2d 758, 760 (R.I. 1998) (emphasis added)). Thus, in Rhode Island, “the [public-safety officer’s] rule has not been limited to barring claims based upon the very same alleged negligence * * * that occasioned the officer’s presence at the scene.” Day, 713 A.2d at 760. Our formulation of the rule requires only that the risk “can reasonably be anticipated to arise in the dangerous situation which [the public-safety officer’s] employment requires them to encounter.” Rinn, 912 A.2d at 940 (quoting Vierra, 619 A.2d at 438).', 'In the course of their employment, police officers are frequently called upon to respond to roadside emergencies. Responding to such situations unquestionably places a police officer in a perilous position, irrespective of the presence of solar glare. As cases from this jurisdiction and others have demonstrated, it is all too common for a police officer to be struck by a vehicle while responding to traffic emergencies. See, e.g., Rinn, 912 A.2d at 939-40; Vierra, 619 A.2d at 436- 37; Wietecha v. Peoronard, 510 A.2d 19, 20-21 (N.J. 1986) (Each of two police officers who were hit by two separate vehicles while responding to a five-car accident could not recover from those drivers whose earlier accidents occasioned the respective officers’ presence at the scene.); Fordham v. Oldroyd, 131 P.3d 280, 287-88 (Utah Ct. App. 2006) (“professional-rescuer doctrine” barred police officer from recovering from the defendant-motorist whose “prior act of alleged negligence brought [police officer] to the location where he was struck by a third party”). In particular, this Court has previously concluded that a police officer could have reasonably officers and firefighters are compensated by the public to confront emergency situations * * *.” Id. Public-safety officers may receive injured-on-duty benefits and other disability benefits. Id. A citizen-taxpayer who pays for the police department to confront the risks that may arise from his or her own acts of negligence does not expect to pay a second time should a police officer be injured while confronting those risks. Vierra, 619 A.2d at 438. Here, Ellinwood acknowledges that he received injured-on-duty benefits after the accident.', '-7- anticipated being struck by another vehicle when she was directing traffic at the scene of an automobile accident. 6 See Vierra, 619 A.2d at 439; see also Rinn, 912 A.2d at 940 (risk of being hit by a vehicle while investigating a traffic infraction is one that a police officer could reasonably anticipate).', 'Here, Ellinwood responded to an accident that took place on what he conceded was a very busy roadway, especially on weekday mornings. We conclude that, regardless of the potential effects of the sunlight, it was foreseeable as a matter of law that he could be struck and injured by another vehicle while coming to Cohen’s assistance. Accordingly, we agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that this case falls within the scope of the public-safety officer’s rule.', 'B', 'Failure to Warn', 'The plaintiff also argues that the instant case is, or should be, considered an exception to the public-safety officer’s rule because defendant failed to warn him of the danger from the sun glare. In support of his argument that Cohen had a duty to warn, Ellinwood cites Mignone v. Fieldcrest Mills, 556 A.2d 35 (R.I. 1989) for the proposition that knowledge of a particularized and unknown danger creates such a duty. He asserts that Cohen’s failure to warn him about the sun glare constituted an independent intervening cause of his injuries.', 'The crux of the public-safety officer’s rule is that it substantially limits the legal duty that a citizen-tortfeasor owes to a public-safety officer. Granting the exception that Ellinwood seeks 6', 'In Vierra, we held that the public-safety officer’s rule was inapplicable because the driver of the car that struck the police officer was not the motorist whose antecedent act of negligence had occasioned the officer’s presence at the scene. See Vierra, 619 A.2d at 439. In the instant case, there is no dispute that defendant’s collision with Soares brought Ellinwood to the scene of the accident.', '-8- would significantly expand that limited duty. Our decision in Mignone did not impose a blanket duty to warn of “unknown” dangers. In that case, the plaintiff-firefighter fell down a flight of stairs while responding to a fire at the defendant’s home. See Mignone, 556 A.2d at 36. The plaintiff alleged that there was a significant amount of water on the staircase. See id. The lower court relied on the public-safety officer’s rule to grant summary judgment in the defendant’s favor. Id. In affirming the grant of summary judgment, we described the limited duty of care owed to public-safety officers as follows:', '“[A]s a matter of law, a firefighter assumes all risks of injury that', 'are known or can reasonably be anticipated while discharging his', 'or her duty at the site of a fire. The homeowner has a duty of not', 'knowingly letting a firefighter fall upon a hidden danger, willfully', 'causing a firefighter harm, or otherwise causing the firefighter to', 'be exposed to a risk or hazard that could not reasonably be', 'anticipated to exist at the site of a fire.” Id. at 40.', 'Ellinwood appears to be relying on this language from Mignone about “hidden” dangers in making his argument that Cohen had a duty to warn him of the “unknown” sun glare. 7 Since Mignone, we have in effect limited this language by repeatedly declining to impose liability on defendants for allegedly failing to warn or prevent harm to police officers from hidden perils. In Day, 713 A.2d at 759, the plaintiff-police officer slipped on ice on the defendant’s walkway while responding to an alarm at the defendant’s home. We held that the public-safety officer’s rule was applicable and characterized Day as not a case “in which a property-owning defendant failed to warn the public-safety officer of a hidden peril on the premises known to that defendant.” Id. at 762. Only a few years later, in Krajewski v. Bourque, 782 A.2d 650 (R.I. 7', 'The plaintiff also cites to Labrie v. Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc., 678 A.2d 867 (R.I. 1996). Our decision in Labrie is inapposite. In that case, we held that the third element of the public-safety officer’s rule was not satisfied because the plaintiff was injured while carrying out a scheduled inspection of the defendant’s sprinkler and alarm system rather than coming to the defendant’s rescue at the scene of an emergency or an accident. See id. at 871.', '-9- 2001), a plaintiff-police officer slipped on ice on the defendants’ driveway. See id. at 651. The police officer argued that the defendants’ failure to sand their driveway constituted a subsequent independent tort. Id. at 652-53. We held “that the defendants’ failure to remove ice from their driveway did not constitute an independent, subsequent act of negligence outside the scope of the police officer’s rule.” Id. at 653; see also Martellucci v. FDIC, 748 A.2d 829, 830-32 (R.I. 2000) (landlord’s alleged failure to maintain parking lot was not subsequent independent tort that would allow police officer to recover for stepping in a pothole while responding to alarm). Considering our refusal in these cases to find that the respective property owners had a duty to prevent the police officer from falling upon a hidden danger, we cannot contemplate the kind of significant erosion of the public-safety officer’s rule that would occur were we to find a duty to warn under the circumstances of the instant case. Here, Cohen was standing on the side of a public roadway, holding his young son in his arms, after just having been in an accident. The plaintiff, acting in his capacity as a police officer, came to Cohen’s assistance. We cannot agree with plaintiff that Cohen needed to have the prescience at that moment to warn plaintiff of the possible effects of sunlight or else risk being liable in tort.', 'Accordingly, we find the application of the public-safety officer’s rule in this case to be fully supported by both law and reason. Since we hold that the public-safety officer’s rule barred Ellinwood’s negligence claim as a matter of law, we conclude that the hearing justice correctly granted the defendant’s motions for summary judgment.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

69,: Town of Little Compton v. : David Simmons. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'In the early morning hours on the day before Christmas, two police officers from Little Compton had a discussion with the defendant, David Simmons, in Tiverton about a motor-vehicle accident that had occurred in Little Compton. The two officers transported the defendant in a police cruiser back to the scene, and once there, they administered a series of field-sobriety tests, which the defendant failed. As a result, Simmons was charged with driving under the influence of liquor or drugs in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31- 27-2; failure to maintain proper control of a motor vehicle, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-14-1; and failing to report an accident, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-26-3. Before the District Court, the defendant moved to dismiss the case, contending that the officers had unlawfully arrested him in Tiverton, where they lacked the authority to do so. The trial judge agreed and suppressed all the evidence; the inevitable result was a dismissal of the charges. The town filed a writ of', '-1- certiorari challenging the dismissal, which we granted on December 22, 2012. On review in this Court, Little Compton argues that the trial judge erred in granting the motion to dismiss because the defendant was not arrested in Tiverton, and in fact, was not arrested until he and the police officers had returned to Little Compton. On January 22, 2014, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this petition for certiorari should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the case without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the District Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Early in the morning of December 24, 2011, three police officers from the Little Compton police department were assisting with a rescue call on Old Stone Church Road in that town. At approximately 3:40 a.m., two of those officers, Officer Farrar and Corporal Harris, saw a man running down the street clad in shorts and a T-shirt. About five minutes later, the Little Compton dispatcher informed the officers that a one-car accident had occurred on Colebrook Road and that the driver was nowhere to be found. The third officer, Corporal Hawes, reported to the collision site while Farrar and Harris decided to pursue the erstwhile jogger they had seen some moments before, surmising that he may have been involved in the accident.', 'Crossing into the town of Tiverton, the officers spotted the still-running defendant and pulled the cruiser alongside him. Farrar testified that he asked defendant if he was out for a jog; defendant answered that he was. Harris then asked defendant if he had just been in an accident and he admitted that he had. Harris got out of the police cruiser, approached defendant, patted him down “for officer safety,” and asked him why he had left the accident.', 'During this', '-2- interaction, Harris noticed a “strong odor of alcohol coming from [defendant’s] breath and that Mr. Simmons’[s] eyes were extremely bloodshot and watery.” Simmons then asked the officers what or whom he had hit and whether anyone had been injured. Harris testified that she told defendant that she did not “believe anybody had been hurt, but that we needed to respond back to the scene.” Simmons indicated that he would return with them, and he got into the backseat of the police cruiser, which, as is typical of such vehicles, was separated from the front by a partition. The officers neither handcuffed defendant nor read him the rights outlined in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). However, as is often the case, once he was in the back of the police cruiser, Simmons was unable to open the door from the inside in the event he desired to get out.', 'When Simmons and the two officers returned to the scene of the accident in Little Compton, defendant was released from the back of the cruiser and was advised to seek medical attention from the on-site medical personnel, which he refused.', 'Significantly, he was not restrained in any way. Harris then administered a series of field-sobriety tests to defendant that he failed. Only then was defendant read his rights, handcuffed, and transported to the Little Compton police station, where he was charged with driving under the influence in violation of § 31-27-2.', 'On January 9, 2012, defendant filed a motion in the District Court to dismiss due to an unlawful arrest, arguing that the Little Compton police officers exceeded their authority because they arrested him in Tiverton. 1 The hearing for the motion to dismiss was held on July 27, 2012; 1', 'It should be noted that two statutes authorize police officers to effect an arrest outside the boundaries of their municipality. See G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19 (granting authority to arrest in any city or town if police are in close pursuit of a suspect); G.L. 1956 § 45-42-1(a) (bestowing upon police officers an emergency police power upon request of assistance from the police chief of any city or town).', '-3- the District Court judge rendered her decision on August 24, 2012. In arriving at her decision, the trial judge dutifully considered the factors outlined in State v. Bailey, 417 A.2d 915 (R.I. 1980), to determine if defendant had been arrested in Tiverton. She concluded that the officers’ actions had amounted to an arrest because (1) once placed in the back of the cruiser, defendant could not voluntarily leave it; (2) the police had not observed defendant commit any crimes; and (3) the police had not informed defendant that he could decline to accompany them back to the collision site in Little Compton. Therefore, the trial judge ruled that the arrest was unlawful, and consequently, she suppressed all the evidence obtained from that point. With the evidence suppressed, the trial judge dismissed the case. The town moved to stay the proceedings and exercised its prerogative to file a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court, which we granted.', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of ‘the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” State v. Poulin, 66 A.3d 419, 423 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 489 (R.I. 2008)). “In addition to examining the record for judicial error, ‘we inspect the record to discern if there is any legally competent evidence to support the findings of the hearing justice below.’” Id. (quoting Brown v. State, 841 A.2d 1116, 1121 (R.I. 2004)). The Court does “not weigh the evidence on certiorari, but only conduct[s a] review to examine questions of law raised in the petition.” WMS Gaming, Inc. v. Sullivan, 6 A.3d 1104, 1111 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Greenberg, 951 A.2d at 489). We review questions of law de novo. Id. (citing Lynch v. Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, 994 A.2d 64, 70 (R.I. 2010)).', '-4-', 'Discussion', 'On certiorari before this Court, the town argues that the trial judge committed reversible error when she granted defendant’s motion to dismiss. The town contends that the arrest of defendant occurred not in Tiverton, but in Little Compton, and not until after he failed the field- sobriety tests. Thus, the town maintains that the interaction between defendant and police in Tiverton did not constitute an arrest.', 'According to G.L. 1956 § 12-7-7, “[a]n arrest is made by the restraint of the person to be arrested or by his or her submission of his or her person to the custody of the person making the arrest.” In Bailey, 417 A.2d at 917-18, we outlined several factors we consider to determine if an arrest has been made. “These [factors] include the extent to which the person’s freedom of movement was curtailed, the belief of a reasonable person under like circumstances, the degree of force used by law enforcement and whether the person had the option of refusing to accompany the police.” State v. Aponte, 800 A.2d 420, 425 (R.I. 2002) (citing State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178, 1181 (R.I. 1999); Bailey, 417 A.2d at 917-18). It is important to note, however, that we have cautioned that “[n]o one factor is dispositive. Rather we analyze the interchange between a suspect and the authorities pragmatically to determine whether an arrest or seizure has in fact occurred.” State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 650 (R.I. 1988). Although the trial judge correctly cited the Bailey factors and engaged in a thoughtful analysis, we disagree with her conclusions and are of the opinion that defendant was not under arrest when he climbed into the back of the Little Compton police cruiser while it was in Tiverton.', 'From the time of the initial conversation between the police officers and defendant until defendant failed the field-sobriety tests, defendant’s freedom of movement was restricted only while he was seated in the back of the police cruiser, a period of a couple of minutes, according', '-5- to Harris. Without question, that restriction was due to the understandable configuration of the doors in the rear of the cruiser. The trial judge concluded that while he was in the back of the police cruiser, defendant was “unable to voluntarily exit th[e] police cruiser.”', 'Although defendant could not have opened the back door of the police cruiser himself, we have difficulty imagining how the two police officers could have transported defendant back to the scene without having him sit in the back of the police cruiser. It seems clear to us that defendant voluntarily entered the police cruiser and was let out of it as soon as the trio arrived at the scene of the accident. In Collins, 543 A.2d at 645, the defendant agreed to allow the police to transport him to his destination albeit “somewhat reluctan[tly].” This Court ultimately concluded that the defendant had not been under arrest even though he also could not voluntarily leave the police vehicle. Id. at 651. In this case, defendant did not convey that he had any reluctance whatsoever to accompany the police back to the accident scene. If anything, his agreement to return to the crash site by riding in the back of the police cruiser created the situation in which he could not exit the vehicle without assistance from the outside.', 'Moreover, although Harris conducted a pat-down of defendant for officer safety, 2 neither he nor Farrar employed any amount of physical force in the course of their interaction with defendant while they were in Tiverton. The defendant was not handcuffed when he was placed in the cruiser, no weapons were displayed, nor was he surrounded by a large number of uniformed police officers. See Collins, 543 A.2d at 651 (discussing that similar lack of physical restraint by police was indicative of no arrest). In Aponte, 800 A.2d at 426, this Court held that the defendant voluntarily accompanied the police, even accepting as accurate his testimony “that 2', 'Such pat-downs are permitted by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). See State v. Duffy, 112 R.I. 276, 281, 308 A.2d 796, 799 (1973) (citing with favor federal Terry-pat standard), overruled on other grounds, State v. McGehearty, 121 R.I. 55, 394 A.2d 1348 (1978); see also State v. Taveras, 39 A.3d 638, 642 & n.6 (R.I. 2012).', '-6- he was frisked and physically manhandled by the officers as he was led to the police car and again into the station * * * .”', 'With respect to the consideration of whether defendant had the option of refusing to go with the police, the trial judge seems to have found it significant that the police did not inform defendant that he was free to leave. In State v. Girard, 799 A.2d 238, 248 (R.I. 2002), the defendant argued that the police had an affirmative duty to inform him that he was free to leave. This Court declined to find such a duty stating, “[a]lthough the police did not tell [the defendant] that he was free to leave; likewise, they never told him that he was not free to leave.” Id. (citing Kryla, 742 A.2d at 1182). It is our opinion that the police were not obligated to inform Simmons that he was not required to accompany them. 3', 'The final consideration is “whether a reasonable person would have understood that he was free to leave under like circumstances.” Aponte, 800 A.2d at 426. The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful seizures is in play “if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.” State v. Ferola, 518 A.2d 1339, 1343 (R.I. 1986) (quoting Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 215 (1984)). This test is objective; a particular defendant’s personal belief about whether he was free to leave is not material because “[t]he appropriate test is not what defendant thought but what a reasonable person would think in similar circumstances.” Aponte, 800 A.2d at 426.', 'The hearing judge did not articulate whether or not she considered this aspect of the Bailey factors; however, we believe that the outcome of this case weighs heavily on its 3', 'The trial judge also appears to have based her decision in part on the fact that the police did not observe defendant driving under the influence or fleeing from the scene of an accident. This fact, which seems more appropriate in a probable-cause analysis, is not relevant to our consideration of whether defendant was under arrest when he left Tiverton with the police.', '-7- determination. After he was patted down, Simmons inquired of the officers about the accident, asking what he had hit or if anyone had been hurt. Harris then responded by stating that she did not believe anyone had been hurt, but that “we needed to respond back to the scene.” This exchange is critical to our review because the statement by Harris, under the circumstances of that morning, appears to indicate that defendant should return with them. Our jurisprudence contains cases in which we have held that if the police ask the defendant to come to the station with them, a reasonable person would feel free to decline. On the other hand, we have held that police action constituted an arrest when police employ language that made it clear that the defendant had no choice in the matter. Compare State v. Kennedy, 569 A.2d 4, 5-6 (R.I. 1990) (holding the defendant was not under arrest when police asked him to go to the station and then offered him a ride because he did not have transportation) with State v. Mattatall, 510 A.2d 947, 951-52 (R.I. 1986) (concluding that the defendant was not free to leave from the moment the police ordered him to go to the station because the defendant was given no opportunity to decline), vacated on other grounds, 479 U.S. 879 (1986), aff’d on other grounds, 525 A.2d 49 (R.I. 1987).', 'In light of our previous holdings, we conclude that Harris’s statement was more like that in Kennedy than the one in Mattatall. The defendant did not express any reluctance after being asked to go with police, as occurred in Collins, but he instead exhibited a willingness to accompany the police. Also, defendant was released, unrestrained, from the cruiser upon arrival at the crash scene. See Aponte, 800 A.2d at 426 (“Significantly, [the] defendant was left alone without restraints in the unmarked police vehicle for at least five minutes.”).', 'We are satisfied that a reasonable person under like circumstances would have felt free to leave when Harris stated that “we needed to respond back to the scene.” After considering the', '-8- record in this case, viewed through the prism of the Bailey factors, we hold that the defendant was not arrested by the Little Compton police while they were in Tiverton.', 'Conclusion', 'The judgment of the District Court is quashed.

The defendant, the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals (MHRH),1 appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court that was entered on November 8, 2010, following a bench trial.

Russo, the plaintiff, holding that the MHRH had violated the Rhode Island Whistleblowers’ Protection Act (WPA), as codified in G.L. 1956 §§ 28-50-1 to -9, when it placed the plaintiff on administrative leave with pay and required that he undergo an independent medical examination (IME). The MHRH contends that the trial justice erred in finding: (1) that placing the plaintiff on paid administrative leave and requiring him to undergo an IME 1', 'In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly changed the name of the MHRH to the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.

We summarize below the relevant testimony elicited at that trial. 2', 'The plaintiff’s complaint also included other counts and named other defendants in addition to the MHRH. At the time of trial, however, the only remaining count was the one alleging violation of the WPA, and the only remaining defendant was the MHRH. The MHRH’s alleged violation of the WPA is the focus of this appeal.', '-2-', 'A', 'The Trial Testimony', 'Mr. Russo testified that, during the portions of 2000 and 2001 at issue in the case, he was working for the State of Rhode Island as a housekeeper stationed at the Highview Building.3 He further testified that he had been stationed at the Highview Building since August of 1999 and that he worked the 1:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. shift. It was his testimony that on, May 11, 2000, he observed another employee, Nancy Palazzo, put a state-owned vacuum cleaner in her personal vehicle and then drive away. According to plaintiff’s testimony about the vacuum cleaner, when he “went to the closet where it was stored * * * it was gone.” He indicated in his testimony that the next day he sent a letter to Steven Strate, who was the acting Administrator of Support Services and also was plaintiff’s supervisor. The plaintiff testified that in the May 12, 2000 letter he reported that the vacuum cleaner was missing; the letter (which plaintiff read into the record at trial) reads in pertinent part as follows:', '“On Thursday night [May 11] the vacuum cleaner was not in the', 'downstairs closet that it was supposed to be in. On Friday, May 12,', 'I asked * * * Nancy Palazzo[] where the vacuum cleaner was. She', 'told me that the vacuum cleaner was locked up.”', 'Mr. Strate testified that, in addition to what he said in the letter, Mr. Russo verbally reported the missing vacuum cleaner to him and told him that Ms. Palazzo had taken it. Mr. Strate also testified that he brought plaintiff’s allegation with respect to the vacuum cleaner to 3', 'In his testimony at trial, Mr. Russo stated that he was “stationed at * * * [the] Highview day site.” Nancy Palazzo, who, according to her testimony (see infra), worked as a “coordinator for residential services” in 2000 and 2001, referred to the building in which she and Mr. Russo worked as the “Highview day site center in Hope Valley.” We shall hereinafter refer to the site simply as the “Highview Building.”', '-3- the attention of Richard Gill, a “unit manager” with offices located in the Highview Building,4 who told him that he had taken the vacuum cleaner for “his unit;” he added that Mr. Gill said that it “belonged to the unit.” Mr. Strate stated during his testimony that he passed this information on to plaintiff within “probably days” of plaintiff’s complaint. By contrast, it was plaintiff’s testimony that the vacuum cleaner was not returned to the Highview Building until August of 2000, at which time it was locked up in Mr. Gill’s office.', 'It was plaintiff’s further testimony that certain employees were bringing their dogs to work and that he took issue with the presence of the dogs in the workplace because he was being “blame[d]” for the deleterious effect of the dogs’ activities on the cleanliness of the building. He testified that he made verbal complaints about the dogs to Mr. Gill in August of 1999 and discussed the issue with respect to the dogs in the workplace with Mr. Strate in February of 2000; he added that he sent a letter to Mr. Gill on September 8, 2000, which specifically requested that dogs no longer be allowed in the Highview Building. According to Mr. Russo’s testimony he also made additional complaints to Mr. Strate regarding the dogs in the workplace.', 'On October 13, 2000, Gerald Clancy, 5 an official within the MHRH, 6 issued a memorandum with respect to pets at work; that memorandum reads as follows: 4', 'Mr. Gill did not testify at trial; however, his deposition was read into the record at trial and entered as an exhibit. With respect to his position with the state during the time period at issue in this case, Mr. Gill testified that he was not “exactly sure of the title” of his position, but he added that he “was what they called a unit manager, the unit manager.” He further testified that as a “unit manager” his responsibilities included being “in charge of” eighteen state-run facilities for the developmentally disabled; he added that his office was located in the Highview Building. Additionally, he testified that he was not Mr. Russo’s “direct supervisor,” but, according to Mr. Gill’s testimony, since Mr. Russo was “the only maintenance guy in the area, [he] would have occasion to ask [Mr. Russo] to get something done because that is just, that was the nature of the job.” 5', 'Mr. Clancy did not testify at trial; however, his deposition was read into the record at trial and entered as an exhibit.', '-4-', '“Effective immediately, no employee is allowed to have their', 'personal pets at work.

The plaintiff stated in his testimony that, after that memorandum was issued, he made reports about employees who continued to bring their dogs to work; he stated that he made those reports to Mr. Strate and that he did so in writing.', 'As is clear from the several documentary exhibits entered into evidence at trial, after the October 13 memorandum was issued, plaintiff was the subject of numerous complaints that were made to supervisors by other employees at the Highview Building. Those complaints referenced both the allegedly subpar quality of plaintiff’s work as well as problems with his behavior in the workplace. According to plaintiff’s testimony at trial, as a result of his reports of dogs having been brought to the workplace, he was threatened by another employee’s husband (who was also a state employee), subjected to “snide remarks,” and had a flea collar left in his mailbox; plaintiff stated, with reference to the other employees working in the Highview Building: “They were harassing me for reporting the pets.” It is important also to note that Mr. Strate testified that complaints about Mr. Russo’s cleaning had been “going on for years,” and Mr. Russo acknowledged on cross-examination that there had been two complaints (one of which was made by Ms. Palazzo) about his job performance in September of 2000—i.e., before the issuance of Mr. Clancy’s memorandum prohibiting pets in the workplace. 6', 'Mr. Clancy testified that his responsibility as an “associate director” of the MHRH was to act as “director of the * * * Rhode Island Community Living and Supports.” 7', 'According to Mr. Clancy’s testimony, the above-referenced memorandum was not issued in “direct response to Mr. Russo’s complaints.” Rather, Mr. Clancy testified that issuing the memorandum was motivated by his “history of disliking dogs in the workplace,” which “culminated” in a specific incident of uncleanliness resulting from pets being permitted in the workplace; Mr. Clancy added that he issued the memorandum “shortly” after that particular incident.', '-5-', 'The plaintiff testified that, after the numerous above-referenced complaints were lodged, he attended a meeting with Mr. Clancy and Kathryn Sherman (a risk manager employed by the state) on November 9, 2000. It was his further testimony that he told Mr. Clancy and Ms. Sherman that he was at the meeting to “report a theft;” he also acknowledged that he told them that he felt he was being retaliated against for his report of the vacuum cleaner “theft” and for his complaints about the presence of dogs in the building. On January 19, 2001, according to Mr. Russo’s testimony, he attended another meeting—this time involving Ms. Sherman, Mr. Clancy, Mr. Strate, and two union stewards—at which Mr. Clancy told him that his “job was safe,” but that he was “[r]equired” to “go to” the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Mr. Russo added that he was told that, although “it wasn’t [his] problem,” there was an issue at the Highview Building that the management staff was “trying to get to the bottom of * * * .” Mr. Russo testified that he was told that he was “being taken out of work at [that] point in time.” He further testified that, following the January 19, 2001 meeting, he met with an individual from the EAP who told him that he would be required to undergo an IME and that an appointment for that purpose had already been arranged. When questioned at trial as to whether he was told that he would be off work until he participated in the IME, Mr. Russo stated: “They said we think you need a break to take care of it;” he added that it was his “understanding [that he wasn’t] going to be allowed to work * * * .”', 'The plaintiff testified that, after being placed on paid administrative leave, he hired an attorney because his “job was on the line.” He stated that he did not attend the scheduled IME but went instead to a doctor whom his lawyer recommended. Mr. Russo indicated at trial that this doctor approved his return to work, and he said that he ultimately resumed his duties at the Highview Building on March 14, 2001. At trial, the following stipulation was read into the', '-6- record: “[P]laintiff * * * was placed on paid administrative leave from January 19, 2001 until his return to work on March 14, 2001, and * * * received his full salary, including a shift differential while he was out of work on administrative leave.”', 'Ms. Sherman testified at trial and corroborated Mr. Russo’s testimony as to his having been placed on paid administrative leave on January 19, 2001 and having been referred to the EAP for an IME. With respect to the EAP and the IME, Ms. Sherman was asked the following question at trial: “If he refused to go, what would have happened to him, he would have been placed out on administrative leave anyway, right?” Her response was: “He would not have been. There was not, if you’re asking me whether or not I would have disciplined him, it was not disciplinary.”', 'Mr. Clancy’s testimony at his deposition was in line with Ms. Sherman’s testimony at trial; he stated that Mr. Russo’s “[administrative] leave was not discipline.” Ms. Sherman was later asked, during her testimony at trial, whether Mr. Russo would have been allowed to return to work if he had not been evaluated by a doctor; and she replied that, if an employee refused to comply with an IME requirement, it would be handled on a “case-by-case basis.” Ms. Sherman added that, “if an employee is required to go [and does not do so], there[sic] could result in disciplinary action.”', 'B', 'The Superior Court’s Decision', 'The trial justice rendered a decision from the bench on November 8, 2010. He ruled that plaintiff had established a prima facie case against the MHRH, finding “that the reporting by Mr. Russo of the alleged theft, which was never really appropriately responded to by the State, and his reporting of the canines coming into the office in rather large numbers, is sufficient to get over the tenets of the statute by reporting what he believed to be violations of statutes and/or', '-7- regulations.” The trial justice recognized that plaintiff “marched to a different drummer,” but he also found him to otherwise be “an extremely credible, conscientious State employee trying to do his job * * * .”', 'With respect to the complaints by other employees about Mr. Russo, the trial justice found them to be retaliatory and inflated; the trial justice found as follows:', '“I find as a fact that all of the State’s witnesses, Ms. Palazzo, Ms.', 'Farrow * * * the other women that were involved in making these', 'complaints against him were exaggerated. Ms. Palazzo was afraid', 'to be in the building with him. Well, what did he do? Well, he', 'walked by me in the darkened hallway. Did he say anything to', 'you? No. Did he look at you? No, he didn’t even look at me. Give', 'me a break; she obviously, in my view, was upset by the fact that', 'Mr. Russo complained that she had stolen a vacuum cleaner.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to find that two of the several complaints made by other employees against Mr. Russo (which complaints the trial justice did not identify with specificity) were more than exaggerated; he stated that those two complaints were “patently, absolutely false, probably defamatory, and completely made up of whole cloth to destroy [Mr. Russo’s] reputation.” According to the trial justice, management turned a “complete blind eye to the retaliatory aspect of the actions of [Mr. Russo’s] co-workers * * * .” In addition, it was the trial justice’s further finding that the entire management staff “swallowed, hook, line and sinker” a particular complaint regarding statements allegedly made by Mr. Russo during a conversation about a then-recent workplace shooting in Wakefield, Massachusetts. 8 As Ms. Sherman 8', 'On December 26, 2000, in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Michael McDermott, a software tester at an Internet consulting company, shot and killed seven of his co-workers.

The defendant submits that it did not “discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate” against Mr. Russo when it placed him on administrative leave because: (1) during his leave, he received full pay, including his shift differential; and (2) when he returned to work, there was no change with respect to his pay, job assignment, or “any other condition of his employment.” It is the MHRH’s contention that placing plaintiff on paid administrative leave, even accompanied by the requirement that he undergo an IME, simply did not qualify as an adverse employment decision under the relevant case law. The plaintiff responds by contending that the trial justice’s decision was not in error, and he relies on the provision of the WPA, which states that a civil action can be brought under the WPA seeking injunctive relief or actual damages. See § 28-50-4(a) (“A person who alleges a violation of this act may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief, or actual damages, or both within three (3) years after the occurrence of the alleged violation of this chapter.”). Mr. Russo further contends that he sustained a loss as a result of the MHRH’s alleged violation of the WPA because: (1) it was necessary that he hire an attorney to participate in negotiations regarding his IME and his return to work; and (2) the actions of the MHRH subjected him to anxiety and emotional trauma.', 'We are in agreement with the contention of the MHRH that the trial justice’s determination that the MHRH violated the WPA by placing Mr. Russo on administrative leave with pay constituted a ruling of law; therefore, in accordance with our usual standard of review in such a situation, we shall review that ruling in a de novo manner. See, e.g., Gianquitti, 22 A.3d at 1165; Grady, 962 A.2d at 41.', '- 12 -', 'We have not previously had occasion to address whether placing an employee on paid administrative leave with the requirement that the employee undergo an IME is the equivalent of the employer having “discharge[d], threaten[ed], or * * * discriminate[d]” against the employee in violation of the WPA. However, our decision in Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426 (R.I. 2003) provides helpful contextual guidance. In Martone, we addressed the issue of how to define a “suspension” under G.L. 1956 § 16-13-5. Martone, 824 A.2d at 428-29. In that case, a tenured teacher at Johnston High School was informed that he was being placed on leave with pay pending an investigation regarding his professional conduct. Id. at 428. Upon completion of the investigation, approximately three months after the teacher was placed on leave, a “Letter of Reprimand” was placed in his permanent file, but he was permitted to return to his teaching duties. Id. The case came before this Court on an appeal from a judgment of mandamus issued by the Superior Court, whereby the Johnston School Committee was ordered to conduct a hearing because, in the view of the trial justice, the teacher had been “suspended” and was therefore entitled to a hearing under § 16-13-5. Martone, 824 A.2d at 428-29. We reversed, holding that the teacher had not been “suspended;” we expressly stated that, “[i]f an individual continues to be paid during the period in question, he or she ha[d] not been suspended.” Id. at 432. We further noted that “[e]ven a constructive suspension requires that an individual be denied pay during the period in question.” Id. (citing Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). Perhaps most instructive for present purposes was our conclusion in Martone that “[t]he use of paid administrative leave provides a reasonable means of immediately neutralizing a potentially contentious situation while minimally affecting the [employee].” Id. at 433.', '- 13 -', 'It is clear to us, from the facts surrounding Mr. Russo’s placement on paid administrative leave, that the MHRH was attempting to do precisely what we described in Martone as “a reasonable means of immediately neutralizing a potentially contentious situation while minimally affecting the [employee].”', ""The MHRH quite understandably opted to use paid administrative leave in order to defuse a difficult situation before it might escalate further. 9 Whether other decision-makers faced with such a situation would have acted in an identical manner is of little pertinence; what matters for present purposes is that there was nothing wrongful in what the MHRH did to deal with the real-world situation with which it had to cope. See Croce v. State, Office of Adjutant General, 881 A.2d 75, 80 n. 9 (R.I. 2005) (“‘Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits—or even the rationality—of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.’”) (quoting Mesnick v. General Electric Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991)). It follows that, if administrative leave with pay is not a suspension and has been deemed by this Court to be a reasonable means of coping with a problematic workplace situation while only “minimally affecting” the employee (see Martone, 824 A.2d at 433), then placing Mr. Russo on administrative leave with pay, even with the requirement that he undergo an IME, was not a “discharge, threat[], or * * * discriminat[ion]” under the WPA."", 'Our confidence in the conclusion that placing Mr. Russo on paid administrative leave was not a “discharge, threat[], or * * * discriminat[ion]” under the WPA is bolstered by a review of federal case law; that case law construes the term “adverse employment action” and requires 9', 'Mr. Clancy testified, in his deposition, that Mr. Russo was placed on “administrative leave[] [s]o there would be no problems on either side for that period of time.” Mr. Clancy further testified, in reference to the Highview Building, as follows: “There was an ongoing back and forth. It put [Mr. Russo] in jeopardy, and it put the other employees in jeopardy. Sometimes the best thing to do is pay someone not to be in the problem. That’s the choice we took.”', '- 14 - that, to be actionable, the employment action must have been materially adverse in order to “prevent lawsuits based upon trivial workplace dissatisfactions” or “bruised ego[s].” White v.

The just-cited decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was subsequently affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in its decision in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006). In its opinion in that case, the Supreme Court required that an employee demonstrate that “a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action [by the employer] materially adverse, [meaning that the action by the employer] well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Id. at 68 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Janie F.

The United States Supreme Court stated that, in analyzing a given act of retaliation, “[c]ontext matters.” White, 548 U.S. at 69. In the context of the instant case it is noteworthy that the duration of Mr. Russo’s paid administrative leave was approximately two months and that the parties stipulated to the fact that he did not receive any diminution in salary during his leave. Moreover, Mr. Russo’s salary continued to include his shift differential, and he returned to work in the same position he had previously held. Thus, there is no evidence that he suffered any change in his salary, benefits, or job responsibilities. See Singletary, 423 F.3d at 891. What is more, several federal appellate courts have specifically held that administrative leave with pay is not an adverse employment action.10 See id. at 891-92 10', 'It is worth noting that a majority of the judges of one federal Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, have found that administrative leave with pay could be an adverse employment action, stating that “[t]he inability to take a promotional exam, loss of [on-call and holiday] pay and opportunities for investigative experience, as well as the general stigma resulting from placement on administrative leave appear reasonably likely to deter employees from engaging in protected activity.” Dahlia v. Rodriquez, 735 F.3d 1060, 1079 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). Notably, the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Dahlia did not state that administrative leave with pay would always constitute an adverse employment action. Moreover and very significantly, the employee in Dahlia, unlike', ""- 16 - (holding that administrative leave with pay followed by a return to the same position was not an adverse employment action); see also Kenney v. Merit Systems Protection Board, 356 F. App'x 394, 396 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that administrative leave with pay was not an adverse action); Joseph v. Leavitt, 465 F.3d 87, 91 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that administrative leave with pay pending criminal charges was not an adverse employment action); Peltier v. United States, 388 F.3d 984, 988 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that an employee on administrative leave with pay while an internal investigation was pending was not subject to an adverse employment action); Von Gunten v. Maryland, 243 F.3d 858, 869 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding that an employee who had been placed on administrative leave with pay pending an investigation of a customer complaint did not suffer an adverse employment action).11"", 'The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Breaux v. City of Garland, 205 F.3d 150 (5th Cir. 2000) is particularly instructive. The plaintiff in Breaux was a police officer who was required to undergo a psychiatric exam after he made a comment to another officer that he was “surprised that someone had not already shot an Internal Affairs investigator between the eyes.” Id. at 154 & n. 7. Similar to Mr. Russo’s paid administrative leave being coupled with a requirement that he undergo an IME, the plaintiff police officer in Breaux, in addition to undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, was also placed on paid administrative leave.', 'Id. at 154.', 'The court in Breaux held that neither the psychiatric examination nor the administrative leave with pay constituted an adverse employment action. Id. at 158; see also McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 559 (5th Cir. 2007); Benningfield v. Mr. Russo, lost holiday and on-call pay, opportunities for investigative experience, and the opportunity to take a promotional exam. 11', 'The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Von Gunten v. Maryland, 243 F.3d 858 (4th Cir. 2001) was abrogated on other grounds by Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 61 (2006).', '- 17 - City of Houston, 157 F.3d 369, 376 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding that, when an employee was required to undergo psychological testing which was designed to assess her fitness for duty, that requirement was not an adverse employment action but rather it was “designed to gather facts to form the basis for an employment decision”). The Fifth Circuit’s holding in Breaux is consistent with the holdings of other federal Circuit Courts. In Caver v. City of Trenton, 420 F.3d 243, 256 (3d Cir. 2005) the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a police department’s requirement that an officer submit to psychological examinations was not an adverse employment action; the court stated: “Where an officer is not guaranteed a negative evaluation upon entering the psychiatrist’s office, merely being required to undergo an evaluation does not harm the officer’s employment opportunities.” In Nichols, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that an employee on a university’s police force was not subjected to a materially adverse employment action when he was placed on paid administrative leave pending the results of a “fitness-for-duty psychological examination[] after he used force to restrain a mentally unstable woman * * * .” Nichols, 510 F.3d at 787. We perceive no material difference between the factual contexts of these several federal appellate cases and the factual context of Mr. Russo’s case.', 'Additionally, we deem it worth noting that the only evidence elicited at trial which even remotely suggested that Mr. Russo could have been subject to any disciplinary action was Ms. Sherman’s testimony that, if an employee was required to undergo an IME and refused, there could be “disciplinary action,” which would be handled on a “case-by-case basis.” However, we observe that Ms. Sherman also testified that plaintiff’s paid administrative leave was not disciplinary, and plaintiff himself testified that he was told that his “job was safe.” We cannot conclude that a reasonable employee would be deterred from alleging discrimination or engaging', '- 18 - in further whistleblowing when there is no threat to his or her continued employment, salary, or benefits. See White, 548 U.S. at 68 (“[w]e refer to reactions of a reasonable employee because we believe that the provision’s standard for judging harm must be objective;” “[a]n objective standard is judicially administrable”) (emphasis in original). Our conclusion is not affected by Mr. Russo’s testimony that he hired an attorney after being placed on paid administrative leave because he felt his “job was on the line.” In our judgment, it is not enough for an employee to decide that he or she needs legal representation when no disciplinary action has been taken and the employee has been assured that his or her job is “safe.” It is our opinion that the fact that Mr. Russo decided to hire an attorney cannot, in our view, transform an otherwise neutral employment action into an adverse employment action. Accordingly, we find ourselves in agreement with the above-referenced federal appellate decisions: paid administrative leave, even with the requirement that an employee undergo an IME, is not an adverse employment action. For this reason, we conclude that it should not be considered a “discharge, threat[], or discriminat[ion]” under the WPA.', 'Mr. Russo’s arguments on appeal do not persuade us otherwise. While he cites to the appropriate sections of the WPA dealing with damages12 and describes what he contends to be his damages in the instant case (namely the fee charged for legal representation during his paid administrative leave and compensation for his anxiety and emotional trauma), in our view he has put “the damages cart before the retaliation horse” (in the metaphorical language employed by defendant). It should go without saying that, before a whistleblower-plaintiff may recover damages under the WPA, it must first be proven that the WPA was in fact violated. In the instant case, we have concluded that the MHRH did not “discharge, threaten, or otherwise 12', 'Mr. Russo cites specifically to G.L. 1956 § 28-50-4(a) and § 28-50-4(c), which deal with the relief available to a plaintiff under the WPA.', '- 19 - discriminate” against Mr. Russo; as a result, he is not entitled to any damages pursuant to the WPA.', 'The plaintiff has cited only one case dealing with paid administrative leave—a federal trial court decision. See Bushfield v. Donahoe, 912 F. Supp. 2d 944, 957 (D. Idaho 2012). In stark contrast with the facts of the instant case, however, the paid administrative leave in the Bushfield case was coupled with what the trial court described as an “unrelenting” investigation into the severity and effects of the plaintiff’s posttraumatic stress disorder.', 'Id.', 'That investigation involved the plaintiff having to “endure personal questions asked by his non-health professional supervisors” even though there had already been a determination as to disability by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Id. Nothing remotely similar transpired in the case before us, and we do not consider Bushfield to be meaningfully supportive of plaintiff’s contentions.', 'The two other cases that plaintiff relies upon are likewise radically distinguishable since they deal with suspensions without pay. See White, 548 U.S. at 70 (concluding that there was enough evidence to support a jury verdict that a reassignment and a thirty-seven-day suspension without pay amounted to retaliation); Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 223, 224 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that a suspension without pay “is sufficient to constitute an adverse employment action,” even if the plaintiff was later reimbursed—because the plaintiff “suffered the loss of the use of her wages for a time”).', 'Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. Russo’s contentions on appeal are not persuasive and do not alter our determination that the decision of the MHRH to place him on paid administrative leave with the requirement that he undergo an IME was not an adverse employment action.', '- 20 - Consequently, we hold that, as a matter of law, the MHRH did not “discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against” plaintiff in violation of the WPA.', 'Since the MHRH did not “discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate” against Mr. Russo, it cannot be found to have violated the WPA and the trial justice’s decision must be reversed. We need delve no further into the MHRH’s other contentions on appeal.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'The judgment of the Superior Court that the MHRH violated the Rhode Island Whistleblowers’ Protection Act is vacated, and this case is remanded to that tribunal with instructions that it enter judgment for the defendant.', '- 21 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Peter W.

71,State : v. : Nayquan Gadson. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Nayquan Gadson, was convicted by a Providence County Superior Court jury of second-degree robbery, and he has appealed from that conviction. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A. The Robbery and the Subsequent Charges', 'On January 13, 2009, Paul Moran and Joan Kovacs were the victims of a robbery that took place on Georgia Avenue in Providence.', 'Over a year later, on February 26, 2010, defendant, along with codefendant Michael Stokes, was charged in connection with that robbery', '-1- in a multi-count indictment. The defendant and codefendant Stokes, who eventually were tried together, were charged with one count of first-degree robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39- 1(a) (Count One); two counts of using a firearm while in the commission of a crime of violence in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(a) (Counts Two & Five); one count of assault with intent to rob in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1 (Count Three); and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 (Count Four). In addition, codefendant Stokes (and he alone) was charged with one count of carrying a handgun without a license in violation of § 11-47-8(a) (Count Six) and one count of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle in a manner which created a substantial risk of death or serious injury in violation of § 11-47-61 (Count Seven).', 'B. The Pre-trial Rulings', 'Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to sever the firearms charges pending against codefendant Stokes or, alternatively, to sever his trial from the trial of Mr. Stokes. The state agreed to sever the charge against Mr. Stokes of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle in a manner which created a substantial risk of death or serious injury (Count Seven); however, the trial justice denied the motion to sever the charge against Mr. Stokes of carrying a handgun without a license (Count Six). The trial justice stated that, even though that charge pertained only to codefendant Stokes, he was satisfied that “the evidence that the same firearm was present among and between [defendants] the day before”1 was “relevant [and] probative;” he added that “to the extent that there’s any prejudice at all, [it was] minimal.” 1', 'The two firearms charges against Mr. Stokes involved actions that related to a discharge of a firearm that allegedly took place on January 12, 2009—the day before the robbery at issue in this case.', '-2-', 'The trial justice also denied defendant’s motion in limine seeking to preclude the state from introducing any evidence tending to show a connection between defendant and the firearm used by Terrell Judd in the commission of the robbery. (The role of Terrell Judd is explained infra.) The trial justice ruled that such evidence is “part and parcel of the offenses charged and is in no way subject to exclusion.”', 'In due course, a jury trial was held over five days in November of 2010. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'C. The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Terrell Judd', 'The first witness for the state was Terrell Judd, who had pled guilty to several felony charges in connection with the robbery at issue. Mr. Judd pled guilty to one count of first-degree robbery, one count of assault with intent to rob, and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery. He testified pursuant to a “MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT,” according to which the state, in consideration of his testimony, agreed to recommend that concurrent sentences of twelve years imprisonment be imposed, with between three and five years to serve.', 'According to Mr. Judd’s testimony, on January 12, 2009 (the day before the robbery), he, along with defendant and codefendant Stokes, drove to the home of defendant’s girlfriend, one Liz Guzman.', 'Mr. Judd testified that Mr. Stokes and defendant went into Ms. Guzman’s residence and then returned to the car; he added that later, while the trio was driving around, he observed a chrome revolver with a black handle in the possession of Mr. Stokes. Mr. Judd testified that he thereafter went his separate way; he added that later the same day he saw his two companions in the parking lot at Ms. Guzman’s residence, where they were sitting in a gray Nissan Altima that he had never seen before.', '-3-', 'Mr. Judd further testified that the next day (January 13) defendant and codefendant Stokes picked him up at his home at approximately 10 a.m. in the same gray Nissan Altima that he had observed on the previous day. Mr. Judd stated that the three men proceeded to drive to defendant’s house and that, at defendant’s direction, he retrieved from inside the house the gun that he had seen in codefendant Stokes’s possession the day before. Mr. Judd identified the gun shown to him at trial as being the one that he used in the robbery.', 'Mr. Judd further testified that defendant later drove away on his own, after first leaving the gun with him; he added that defendant had said that he thought he recognized someone in another car as being a particular person with whom the three men did not get along. It was Mr. Judd’s further testimony that defendant thereafter returned, stating that he had been mistaken about the identity of the person in the other car, but also stating that he had spotted a man and woman who “looked * * * drunk;” Mr. Judd stated that defendant suggested that the three men should “go lick them,” and Mr. Judd acknowledged that he understood that expression to mean go “rob” them. Mr. Judd testified that he wanted to carry out the robbery and that defendant “wanted to go” as well, whereas Mr. Stokes was “hesitant,” “didn’t want to do [the robbery],” and “seemed confused.” Mr. Judd stated that he, along with defendant and Mr. Stokes, drove to the next block and parked the Nissan Altima in a driveway. He added that Mr. Stokes remained in the car talking on the phone as Mr. Judd and defendant exited the vehicle.', 'It was the further testimony of Mr. Judd that, after he and defendant had raised the hoods of their sweatshirts, he went to the side door of the vehicle on the driver’s side where Mr. Moran was seated, while defendant went to the side door on the passenger side where Ms. Kovacs was seated. Mr. Judd added that, at that point, defendant engaged in a “tug-o-war[sic]” with Ms. Kovacs in an effort to take a purse. Mr. Judd further testified that, once defendant had the purse', '-4- in his possession, he began to run away. At about the same time, according to the testimony of Mr. Judd, he approached Mr. Moran, pointed the gun at his chest, and ordered him out of the car. It was the further testimony of Mr. Judd, however, that Mr. Moran then released a large dog from the car that began to chase him. Mr. Judd stated that he ran back to the Nissan Altima, where he found defendant as well as codefendant Stokes. He added that, after defendant drove the trio in the Nissan Altima to a Shell gas station, defendant handed Ms. Kovacs’s purse to codefendant Stokes, who proceeded to remove money from it and then throw it out of the window of the vehicle. The money was then divided among the three occupants of the Nissan Altima.', 'Mr. Judd further stated that, after the three men left the Shell station and began driving along Interstate 95, they were pursued by the police. He testified that, as a result, the fleeing men drove off the interstate highway while he looked for a good place where he might throw the gun—which he said that he did. Mr. Judd stated that, upon reaching Gordon Avenue, the trio abandoned the vehicle and fled. It was Mr. Judd’s further testimony that a police officer thereafter spotted him hiding under another vehicle and proceeded to place him in handcuffs. Mr. Judd explained that he was taken to a nearby “housing unit,” where he was identified by the victims. Mr. Judd also showed the police where he had thrown the gun, and he was then brought to the police station; there, he spoke to the police about the robbery and identified defendant and Mr. Stokes as the other men involved in the criminal activity.', '2. The Testimony of Joan Kovacs2', 'Ms. Kovacs testified that she had been consuming alcoholic beverages at Paul Moran’s house on Georgia Avenue for “a couple of hours” on the morning of the robbery. Ms. Kovacs stated that, while she was sitting with Mr. Moran in her car in front of his house, she observed a 2', 'At the time of trial, Paul Moran (the other victim of the robbery) was unable to testify due to the fact that he was hospitalized.', '-5- “dark gray” “Nissan or Altima” enter the “next-door neighbor’s yard.” She further testified that she saw two “black boys wearing [black] hoods” approach the car and that she noticed that one of them had a “[s]ilver” handgun. According to Ms. Kovacs, one of those individuals went to the driver’s side (where Mr. Moran was seated), while the other came to her side of the vehicle and showed her the gun. Ms. Kovacs testified that she was in fear and that, “[b]ecause of the gun,” she turned over her purse, which contained between $1,000 and $2,000 in cash; upon being further questioned, she denied that there was a “tug-of-war” over the purse.', '3. The Testimony of Kevin Perkins', 'Kevin Perkins, a neighbor of Paul Moran, testified that, on the morning of January 13, 2009, he had spoken with Mr. Moran and Ms. Kovacs while they were sitting in a car in front of Mr. Moran’s home. It was Mr. Perkins’ testimony that, as he was walking away, he observed “two kids” near a gray car parked in a neighbor’s “yard.” Mr. Perkins recalled that the hood of at least one of the “kids” was raised. Mr. Perkins further testified that he continued walking away and that he then observed Mr. Moran’s dog chasing a young man who jumped into the back seat of the gray car as it was driving away. Mr. Perkins acknowledged that, later that day, he had been taken by the police to observe the vehicle abandoned by the suspects on Gordon Avenue, which he identified as the same gray car that he had seen the morning of the robbery.', '4. The Testimony of Detective Stephen Gencarella', 'Detective Stephen Gencarella of the Providence Police Department’s robbery squad testified that, on January 13, 2009, upon hearing a police broadcast that an armed robbery had occurred and that the suspects had abandoned their vehicle near the corner of Gallop Street and Gordon Avenue, he went to that area. He stated that, while canvassing the surrounding area for suspects, he observed a black male jump over a fence and begin running; he added that he', '-6- pursued and apprehended that person. At trial, Detective Gencarella identified defendant as being the person whom he had pursued and apprehended on the day of the robbery.', '5. The Testimony of Officer David DePina', 'Officer David DePina of the Providence Police Department testified that, on February 2, 2009, having been dispatched to Narragansett Avenue, he met with a person (not previously known to him) who had come across a gun; he said that that person pointed out the gun on the sidewalk in front of 116 Narragansett Avenue. A loaded .32 caliber revolver, silver in color and with a black handle was recovered from the sidewalk. At trial, he identified the gun in photographs shown to him as the gun that had been pointed out to him at 116 Narragansett Avenue.', 'D. The Motions for Judgment of Acquittal', 'After the prosecution rested on November 8, 2010, defendant moved, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal with respect to Counts One through Five of the indictment; he based that motion on what he contended was the insufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution. The trial justice denied defendant’s Rule 29 motion in its entirety.', 'Codefendant Stokes also moved pursuant to Rule 29 for a judgment of acquittal with respect to Counts One through Six of the indictment. The trial justice granted Mr. Stokes’s motion in part, finding that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could find codefendant Stokes guilty of the conspiracy charge (Count Four) beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial justice found that codefendant Stokes did not participate in any way in the robbery from Ms. Kovacs or in the assault with intent to rob of Mr. Moran. The trial justice said that, for that reason, codefendant Stokes could not be found vicariously liable for the alleged criminal conduct', '-7- of defendant or Mr. Judd as a coconspirator; and the trial justice expressly cited the leading case of Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). Accordingly, the trial justice granted Mr. Stokes’s Rule 29 motion only with respect to Counts Two through Five, and he reduced the charge of first-degree robbery (Count One) to the lesser included charge of receiving stolen property. The trial justice denied Mr. Stokes’s motion for acquittal as to Count Six, the charge of carrying a handgun without a license.', 'At the close of all the evidence, defendant, having opted not to present any evidence, renewed his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal. In reference to the conspiracy charge (Count Four), defendant stated that the state must prove the involvement of at least two people in a conspiracy; and defendant then argued that, in view of that principle and the fact that codefendant Stokes had been acquitted on the conspiracy count and that Mr. Judd was not charged as a coconspirator, defendant must be acquitted of the conspiracy charge. Ruling in a manner that was consistent with defendant’s reasoning and citing State v. DeSanto, 603 A.2d 744 (R.I. 1992), the trial justice granted defendant’s Rule 29 motion as to the conspiracy charge.', 'The trial justice also noted that Mr. Judd’s use of a gun in the attempted robbery of Mr. Moran could not be imputed to defendant under the theory of coconspirator liability in view of the fact that Mr. Judd had not been indicted in the instant case. Accordingly, the trial justice reduced the first-degree robbery charge against defendant to that of second-degree robbery. The trial justice stated: “The case will go to the jury with regard to Mr. Gadson only as to Joan Kovacs, either as second-degree robbery or as larceny from the person.”', 'E. The Jury Instructions and the Ensuing Verdict', 'After both the prosecution and the defense had made their closing arguments, the trial justice instructed the jury as to the “Verdict Form;” he stated in pertinent part:', '-8-', '“[W]ith respect to Nayquan Gadson, it asks whether or not you', 'find him guilty * * * of second-degree robbery [from] Joan', 'Kovacs. * * * [T]hen you should ask yourselves whether or not he', 'committed the lesser offense, as I’ve explained to you, of larceny', 'from the person. There’s a line for that as well. If you find', '[defendant] guilty of second-degree robbery, then you need not', 'consider the issue as to whether he’s guilty of the lesser included', 'offense of larceny.”', 'After deliberating, the jury returned to the courtroom to render its verdict. Of pertinence to this appeal, the foreman orally announced that defendant was guilty of second-degree robbery but not guilty of larceny from the person.3', 'Outside the presence of the jury, the trial justice stated that defendant was “exonerated,” but the prosecutor interjected that defendant had been found guilty of second-degree robbery. At that point, the trial justice, looking at the verdict form, stated that he had “misheard [the verdict] entirely.” The jury was escorted back into the courtroom, at which time the trial justice made the following statement:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry to trouble you, but some of the', 'lawyers and, indeed, the Court misheard the foreman’s', 'announcement as to the nature of the verdict. The prosecutors', 'heard one thing. The defense heard another. I heard a different', 'thing.” The trial justice had the verdict form passed back to the foreman, who stated that the verdict form accurately reflected the finding of the jury to the effect that defendant was guilty of second- degree robbery.4 The jurors were then polled individually, and the foreman’s statement was 3', 'The jury found codefendant Stokes guilty of receiving stolen property and not guilty of unlawfully carrying a pistol without a license. 4', 'The verdict form, as it was provided to the jury, reads in pertinent part as follows:', '“DO YOU FIND DEFENDANT NAYQUAN GADSON GUILTY OR NOT', 'GUILTY OF THE FOLLOWING OFFENSES:', '-9- unanimously confirmed. However, neither the foreman nor the individual jurors were asked to report a finding as to the charge of larceny from the person that was included on the verdict form but had been left blank. At that point, the following significant exchange took place:', '“[Defense Counsel]: The only thing I would add, Your Honor, is', 'that not reflected on the jury verdict form is that Madam Clerk', 'asked the jury foreman, as to the larceny, whether they found', 'guilty or not guilty, and they did indicate not guilty, but we knew', 'that was a lesser included charge, and that is not indicated or', 'marked as to section 1(a), larceny from the person, which I don’t', 'believe is necessary in any event.', '“[Trial Justice]: All right. I don’t know, frankly, at this point,', 'what the court reporter’s notes indicate, but, since it’s a lesser', 'included offense, he was found guilty of the second degree murder', '(sic), the larceny from person is of no moment. Agreed?', '“[Defense Counsel]: Second-degree robbery, yes, Your Honor.', '“[Trial Justice]: Thank you; correct. It’s of no moment, correct?', '“[Defense Counsel]: Correct, Your Honor. I agree.”', 'On December 9, 2011, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. In due course, defendant was sentenced to a total of thirty years imprisonment, with twelve years to serve and the remaining eighteen years suspended, with probation. The defendant appealed to this Court.', '1. SECOND DEGREE ROBBERY OF JOAN KOVACS:', 'GUILTY________ NOT GUILTY _________', '1A. LARCENY FROM THE PERSON OF JOAN KOVACS:', 'GUILTY________ NOT GUILTY _________”', 'We note that, after the jury had deliberated, the line on the verdict form relating to “GUILTY” with respect to the second-degree robbery charge was marked with an “X,” while both the “GUILTY” and “NOT GUILTY” lines with respect to the charge of larceny from the person were left blank.', '- 10 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred: (1) in failing to dismiss the second- degree robbery charge in view of what defendant contends was a “not guilty” finding by the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny from the person; (2) in denying defendant’s motion to sever Count Six, which charged codefendant Stokes (and him alone) with carrying a handgun without a license; and (3) in denying defendant’s motion in limine seeking to “preclude the State from submitting or referring to: * * * any alleged connection between Gadson and the firearm used by Judd to commit the robbery.”', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A. The Failure to Dismiss the Robbery Charge', 'The defendant contends that the trial judge should have dismissed the robbery charge against him after the jury foreman announced a verdict of not guilty on the lesser included charge of larceny from the person.', ""This Court’s settled raise or waive rule “requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.” See, e.g., State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011) (“This Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule, which requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.”); State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 927 (R.I. 2009) (“This Court's familiar raise-or-waive rule precludes us from considering issues at the appellate level that were not properly presented before the trial court.”); Bouchard v. Clark, 581 A.2d 715, 716 (R.I. 1990). A corollary principle is that this Court will not review issues that were not presented to the trial court “in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question"", '- 11 - being raised.” Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 30 (R.I. 2009); State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828–29 (R.I. 2008).', 'Our review of the record reveals that defense counsel did not at any point during the colloquy that followed the jury’s rendering of its verdict assert that the jury foreman’s oral announcement of a not-guilty verdict on the lesser included charge of larceny from the person required acquittal on the more serious charge of second-degree robbery. The defendant seeks to raise that issue for the first time on appeal.', 'It is true that, after the jury had been polled individually with respect to the finding of guilt on the charge of second-degree robbery, defense counsel drew the trial justice’s attention to the fact that the jury foreman had initially announced a verdict of not guilty with respect to the larceny charge whereas no such verdict was indicated on the verdict form. However, the fatal flaw in defendant’s argument before this Court is that he explicitly told the trial justice that he did not believe that it was necessary that there be an indication on the verdict form of the jury’s verdict concerning the charge of larceny from the person. Defense counsel went as far as to expressly agree with the trial justice that the charge of larceny from the person was “of no moment” in view of the fact that defendant had been found guilty of second-degree robbery. Accordingly, it is our view that defendant did not properly preserve this issue for appeal; therefore, we shall proceed to consider the next issue on appeal.', 'B. Joinder and the Motion to Sever', 'The defendant contends that he was unduly prejudiced by the joinder of Count Six, which related only to codefendant Stokes, in the same indictment with Counts One through Five, which related to both defendants. In order to evaluate defendant’s contention, we look to Rule 8 and', '- 12 - Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Cassey, 543 A.2d 670, 673-74 (R.I. 1988); see also State v. Pereira, 973 A.2d 19, 25-28 (R.I. 2009).', 'We shall begin our inquiry by determining whether, as defendant asserts, it was inappropriate under Rule 8 to bring a single indictment against both defendants instead of charging them in two separate indictments. While it is not entirely clear which subsection of Rule 8 defendant contends was violated,5 we have carefully scrutinized the record, and we perceive nothing therein that would cause us to conclude that the joinder of Count Six against codefendant Stokes with Counts One through Five against both defendants constituted a violation of either subsection. Whether viewed through the prism of Rule 8(a) or Rule 8(b), there is more than sufficient relationship between the factual basis of Count Six and the factual bases of Counts One through Five to justify their joinder as a matter of law. Accordingly, we next turn to defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to sever under Rule 14.6', 'Even when (as in this case) joinder under Rule 8 is proper, a defendant may nonetheless seek to show that he or she faces the possibility of being prejudiced to such an extent that relief from joinder is appropriate under Rule 14. See, e.g., Pereira, 973 A.2d at 25-28. This Court has repeatedly stated that severance under Rule 14 is “not a matter of right but rather is an issue 5', 'Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure is entitled “Joinder of Offenses,” while Rule 8(b) is entitled “Joinder of Defendants.” 6', 'The pertinent portion of Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:', '“If it appears that a defendant or the State is prejudiced by a', 'joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, information,', 'or complaint or by such joinder for trial together, the court may', 'order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of', 'defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.”', ""- 13 - directed to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Ashness, 461 A.2d 659, 668 (R.I. 1983); see State v. Botas, 71 A.3d 430, 433 (R.I. 2013); State v. Vanasse, 593 A.2d 58, 66 (R.I. 1991); Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673. In considering whether there is sufficient prejudice to warrant severance, the trial justice must balance “efficiency and convenience in judicial administration on the one hand and the defendant's right to a fair trial without prejudice on the other.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1241 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Pereira, 973 A.2d at 28; State v. Day, 898 A.2d 698, 705 (R.I. 2006). Accordingly, “denial of a motion to sever will not be reversed on [appellate] review unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.” Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673; see Vanasse, 593 A.2d at 66; see also State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 309 (R.I. 2011). To prevail in an effort to show that a trial justice has abused his or her discretion in this regard, “[t]he defendant must affirmatively show that in fact he has suffered prejudice as a result of the joint trial to the extent that it has impinged upon his right to a fair trial.” Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673; see Ashness, 461 A.2d at 669; State v. Gibbons, 418 A.2d 830, 835 (R.I. 1980)."", 'In our judgment, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion to sever. The evidence which the state needed to introduce in order to meet its burden of proof with respect to Count Six (which related to Mr. Stokes’s possession of a handgun on January 12, 2009) would be easily distinguishable by a reasonable jury as being applicable only to Mr. Stokes and not to defendant. See Cassey, 543 A.2d at 674 (holding that denial of the motion to sever was not an abuse of discretion where the evidence was relatively simple and straightforward and the jury would have no significant difficulty in separating out the evidence against each defendant); see also Day, 898 A.2d at 705. Moreover, in our opinion, a charge of possession of a handgun without a license is not the type of charge that would tend to confuse', '- 14 - and mislead the jury, nor is it a charge that would cause the jurors to become more easily convinced of defendant’s guilt with respect to the robbery than would be the case in the absence of such evidence. See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993) (stating that severance should be granted “only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would * * * prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence”). In addition, and significantly, among the instructions given to the jury before it began deliberations was one that specifically instructed the jury not to let the guilt or innocence of one defendant influence its verdict with respect to the other defendant.', 'In addition, we are not persuaded that defendant has shown that he in fact suffered real and substantial prejudice from the joinder of Count Six to such a degree that he was denied a fair trial. See Day, 898 A.2d at 705 (“It is not sufficient for the defendant to cite the potential for and the likelihood of prejudice. His burden is to demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from the joinder.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); Ashness, 461 A.2d at 669 (“Mere allegations of potential prejudice are not sufficient. The defendant must support his motion with more than a showing of disadvantage.”). We note that Mr. Stokes was ultimately acquitted of unlawfully carrying a handgun without a license. Moreover, defendant was not convicted of any crime involving a firearm since the trial justice reduced the first-degree robbery charge against him to that of the lesser included offense of second-degree robbery, which offense is statutorily defined as “robbery or other larceny from the person by force or threat, where there is no weapon and no injury * * * .” Section 11-39-1(b). In the absence of a showing of substantial prejudice or unfairness that would outweigh this Court’s consideration of the trial justice’s legitimate concerns for judicial economy, we perceive no basis for holding that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying defendant’s motion to sever Count Six.', '- 15 -', 'C. The Motion in Limine', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion in limine seeking to “preclude the State from submitting or referring to: * * * any alleged connection between Gadson and the firearm used by Judd to commit the robbery.” “The preliminary grant or denial of an in limine motion need not be taken as a final determination of the admissibility of the evidence referred to in the motion.” State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1220 (R.I. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 238 (R.I. 2008). This Court has consistently held that a failure to object “in the vital context of the trial itself (except where the in limine ruling was unequivocally definitive) [constitutes] a waiver of the evidentiary objection and [is] therefore an issue that may not be raised on appeal.” State v. Andujar, 899 A.2d 1209, 1222 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 108 (R.I. 2005) (“[E]xcept when the in limine ruling is clearly definitive, it would at the very least be prudent for counsel to articulate the objection once again in the vital context of the trial itself.”) (emphasis in original). In the present case, the record does not reflect that the trial justice’s ruling on the defendant’s motion at issue was “unequivocally definitive.” Andujar, 899 A.2d at 1222. Therefore, we conclude that the defendant did not preserve this evidentiary challenge for appellate review because defense counsel did not renew his objection to the admission of the contested evidence at the trial itself.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.

72,": v. : Paul Savoie, Alias. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.', 'The plaintiff, Paul Savoie, appeals from a November 14, 2011 judgment in favor of the defendants, Langdon Wilby and Tammy Emmett. 1 The plaintiff and the defendants were members of the board of directors of Green Mountain Park, Inc., a Vermont corporation formed for the purpose of reconstructing, reviving, and operating a defunct horseracing facility in the Town of Pownal, Vermont. The plaintiff invested $350,000 in the venture before the project was ultimately abandoned due to issues surrounding the corporation’s ability to obtain a racetrack license. The plaintiff brought claims against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, 2 breach of contract, and fraud. At the conclusion of a bench trial in Superior Court, the trial justice entered judgment for the defendants on all counts. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'This lawsuit was initially brought by Emmett and Wilby against Savoie; however, this appeal solely concerns the judgment on Savoie’s counterclaims. Therefore, we will refer to Savoie as the plaintiff, and Wilby and Emmett shall be referred to as the defendants. 2', 'Count 1 of Savoie’s amended counterclaim is titled “negligence”; however, the specific allegations relate only to the execution of Wilby’s and Emmett’s fiduciary duties to the corporation and/or to Savoie as a shareholder.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The Racetrack Property', 'In early 1997, Marcus Vitali, a horse trainer, became aware that an unused racetrack facility in the Town of Pownal, Vermont was available after being closed for nearly a decade. Vitali told an acquaintance, Langdon Wilby, about the racetrack and presented the idea of rehabilitating the facility. Wilby had been working in the restaurant industry for approximately thirty years, and he owned a restaurant called “Lang’s Villa Rosa” 3 in Massachusetts. Wilby had no experience developing, managing, or running racetracks prior to the beginning of this particular venture. After discussing the potential project, Vitali and Wilby visited the racetrack facility and met with the owner of the property, Mr. Tietjen. 4', 'It is not clear whether Vitali or Wilby ever executed a lease agreement regarding the racetrack property. According to Wilby, there was first an “oral commitment” in the spring of 1997 and then a signed lease for the racetrack premises the following summer. 5 The oral agreement allegedly gave Wilby and Vitali permission to take possession of the premises, on the condition that they would receive a racing license. Vitali also testified that he and his wife, Tammy Emmett, and Wilby reached an “agreement” with Tietjen in 1997, which was signed and reduced to writing. No written lease was produced at trial. At some point in 1997, Wilby and Vitali, along with two other acquaintances, Gary Owens and Paul Rizzo, began working to 3', 'At trial, Wilby’s restaurant was referred to variously as “Lang’s Villa Rosa,” “Lang’s Villa,” and “the Villa Rosa.” We shall call it “Lang’s Villa Rosa.” 4', 'According to Vitali, the racetrack was owned by “George Tietjen.” According to Wilby, this person was “John Tietjen.” The trial justice’s decision refers to the owner as “Mr. Tiegens.” We shall refer to him as “Tietjen.” 5', 'In his deposition, however, Wilby stated that there was never a written lease. Also, on July 17, 1998, Wilby’s attorney sent him a letter in which he indicated that he had not heard anything about a lease agreement with the racetrack owners.', '-2- rehabilitate the racetrack property. Vitali supervised the project and was in charge of hiring and billing. Owens and Rizzo held managerial positions. 6', 'The Corporation', 'On July 21, 1997, Wilby and Emmett formed a Vermont corporation called Green Mountain Park, Inc. (Green Mountain), for the purpose of “conducting thoroughbred and other horse racing and the simulcasting of same at lawfully licensed establishments.” The articles of incorporation listed three directors: Wilby, Emmett, and Ralph A. Foote, who was also the corporation’s legal counsel. Wilby served as President and Treasurer of Green Mountain, and Emmett was Vice President and Secretary. Vitali chose not to be involved in the corporation as a stockholder, director, or officer, because he did not want his career as a horse trainer to be jeopardized in the event that the corporation’s racing license was denied. Vitali testified that Emmett, his wife, “agreed to be part of the venture and step in.” According to Wilby, Vitali made the decisions for Emmett’s share of the corporation. Emmett testified that Vitali was authorized only to perform work that she had assigned to him, but she could not recall at trial any specific duties or tasks that she had so assigned. 7', 'Savoie’s Involvement in Green Mountain Park, Inc.', 'Wilby, Vitali, and Emmett began to look for investors in the summer of 1997. Vitali had known Paul Savoie, a former Pawtucket firefighter, for many years. Vitali, knowing that Savoie had been previously involved in dog racing, thought that Savoie might be interested in participating in the new racetrack venture. Vitali introduced Savoie to Wilby in late 1997 or 6', 'According to Wilby, Owens served as general manager of the racetrack beginning in May 1997, and Rizzo was the assistant general manager. In a Small Business Plan submitted to the Vermont racetrack licensing commission, however, Owens was listed as the corporation’s “Chief,” and Rizzo was listed as “General Manager.” 7', 'Emmett also testified that she suffered from a “brain hemorrhage” and that her memory had been affected as a result.', '-3- early 1998 at Lang’s Villa Rosa. A couple of weeks after Savoie met Wilby, Savoie agreed to invest $350,000 in the enterprise. Wilby testified that he met with Savoie approximately fifteen to twenty times prior to the time when Savoie made his investment. Savoie testified, in contrast, that they had only “[t]wo or three” meetings. Vitali estimated that he met with Savoie seven times prior to Savoie’s investment, and Emmett testified that she met with Savoie at least once.', 'Savoie testified that, prior to investing, he did not ask Wilby or Vitali about financial matters, nor did he inquire about their business plan, the prospective purchase of the racetrack property, or any lease arrangements.', 'Savoie also testified that he did not ask about any preliminary work that had been done on the racetrack, did not ask to see any records, and did not know whether the company had been incorporated. Savoie also did not ask whether Wilby or Emmett had any prior experience with racetracks. Savoie was aware that Vitali was a horse trainer and that Emmett owned a horse farm. According to Wilby, Savoie was also aware that Vitali would essentially be in charge of the racetrack operation even though he was not a formal member of the company. Savoie also knew that Wilby and Emmett had hired Attorney Foote as their legal counsel, but he did not attempt to contact Attorney Foote prior to investing.', 'Savoie testified that he visited the racetrack property once before he invested and observed that it was “kind of run down.” Later on, however, Savoie testified that he could not recall whether he visited the property before investing. Vitali testified that Savoie went to the racetrack once before making his investment and that he “never really asked a lot of questions.” When asked at trial, “what did you do for due diligence before issuing the check for $350,000?” Savoie replied, “I didn’t do anything.”', 'Prior to making his $350,000 investment, Savoie met with his brother, Robert, who worked as a financial analyst. This meeting was arranged by Wilby and Vitali. Savoie told', '-4- Robert that he “had an opportunity to own part of a racetrack” and that he intended to invest $350,000. Savoie first testified that Robert did not express an opinion regarding the investment. Later during trial, however, Savoie stated that his brother told him that “he didn’t really think [the investment] was a good idea.”', 'According to Savoie, Wilby and Emmett both told him that they would invest $175,000 in the racetrack venture; however, they actually invested only $100,000 each, a few days after Savoie made his initial deposit of $350,000 into a new bank account opened for Green Mountain at Vermont National Bank. Savoie received a one-third equity interest in the corporation in exchange for his monetary investment, with Wilby and Emmett holding the other two-thirds. 8', 'At the first shareholders meeting, held on April 9, 1998, Savoie was elected to the board of directors, and Attorney Foote resigned. 9 The corporate minutes also indicate that Wilby was elected President and Treasurer, and Emmett was elected Vice President and Secretary. Wilby testified that his duties as President were to oversee the general activities of the racetrack and that, as Treasurer, he was responsible for “checking the books.” 10 Wilby testified that Vitali handled the payroll for the corporation and was in charge of the petty cash. Emmett testified that she held the positions of Secretary and Vice President, although she also stated that Savoie replaced her as Vice President at some point during the venture. Emmett testified that she believed she “had no responsibilities” in the development of the business. 8', 'Wilby, Emmett, and Savoie were the only shareholders of Green Mountain, with 10,000 shares apiece. 9', 'The minutes from this meeting also indicate that the board of directors resolved to treat Green Mountain “as a small business corporation for income tax purposes.” However, there is no indication that any action was taken as a result of this resolution, and the corporation never filed income tax returns. 10', 'When deposed prior to trial, however, Wilby stated that he “never had any responsibilities” as Treasurer.', '-5-', 'Savoie testified that he never served as an officer of Green Mountain. According to Wilby, however, Savoie served as Vice President of the corporation starting in the spring of 1998. Wilby did not produce any records to support this assertion. Wilby also testified that Savoie was elected Secretary of the corporation shortly after he became involved in the business. Savoie was identified as “Secretary” in a Small Business Plan submitted to the Vermont licensing commission. 11', 'The parties presented conflicting testimonies regarding the extent of Savoie’s presence at the racetrack in 1998 and early 1999. According to Savoie, he visited the racetrack only “[o]n one or two occasions” after he made his investment and stayed overnight “once or twice.” Savoie testified that he spent a total of “four or five” days at the racetrack between the spring of 1998 and February 1999. Savoie contended that he did not help with the racetrack rehabilitation project, was not assigned any responsibilities in developing the company, and did not attend any formal meetings to discuss the development of the venture. 12 Savoie did testify, however, that each time he visited the racetrack he would go to “the deli across the road,” which was owned by James Winchester, who was also a member of Green Mountain’s board of directors. Savoie also testified that, when he went to the track, he would spend the day with Doug Saunders, who had 11', 'Wilby was unable to reconcile the difference between the corporation’s Small Business Plan, which listed Savoie as Secretary, and the minutes of the April 1998 meeting that listed Emmett as Secretary. 12', 'Roger R. Nolette, a friend of Savoie since the early 1970s, testified that he was a Eucharistic Minister at a parish of which Savoie’s mother was a member in 1998. Nolette testified that he and Savoie had a practice of delivering communion to Savoie’s ill mother in the Town of Bristol, Rhode Island, approximately once a week throughout some or all of 1998. Nolette testified that this activity did not occur on the same day each week, and that he would call Savoie between twenty-four and forty-eight hours in advance to schedule the meetings. Nolette did not recall Savoie ever telling him that he was unavailable because he was in Vermont. Nolette also testified that he and Savoie had a tradition of gathering with friends at a bar in the City of Pawtucket, “on just about a daily basis” throughout the year in 1998.', '-6- been hired as the head of racetrack security. 13 Savoie, Wilby, and Vitali all testified that Savoie kept an antique car at the racetrack.', 'Wilby, on the other hand, testified that he saw Savoie “at least five times a week,” either at Lang’s Villa Rosa or at the racetrack, after Savoie made his investment. Wilby stated that, “I [Wilby] used to go up on a Monday and Tuesday and [Savoie] was there almost all summer long when I went up.” Wilby also testified that Savoie would go to the hardware store, that “[h]e spent time over at the deli,” and that he would stay overnight in the jockeys’ room. According to Vitali, “[Savoie] was there a lot. I [Vitali] can’t say how often, but he was there quite a bit, you know, we were working. He would come floating through, walking around, you know, he had his car downstairs. He was around quite often. He’d stay in the jockey[s’] room.” According to Vitali, Savoie would “stay a couple of days, go home, and come back.” Vitali testified that Savoie was “absolutely” present at the track more than four or five times in 1998.', 'The Checks', 'At some point in 1997, Vitali began hiring local workers to perform renovations on the racetrack property, paying them first in cash and then with checks drawn from the account of his and Emmett’s business, Country Side Farms. 14 Vitali testified that, when he paid workers in cash, he did not obtain receipts.', 'In the spring of 1998, Green Mountain opened a business account at Vermont National Bank with an initial deposit of Savoie’s $350,000, followed shortly by Wilby and Emmett’s $200,000.', 'More than 250 checks drawn on the Green Mountain account were introduced into evidence at trial. The checks were made out to various payees, including “Villa Rosa” (Wilby’s 13', 'Wilby described Saunders as Tietjen’s “right-hand man.” 14', 'Emmett testified that Country Side Farms was a horse boarding facility located in Massachusetts that also provided horse-riding lessons. Country Side Farms had its own checking account in 1997, on which Emmett and Vitali were authorized signatories.', '-7- restaurant) and “Country Side Farms” (Vitali and Emmett’s horse farm), 15 and they all contained what purported to be Savoie’s, Wilby’s, and Emmett’s signatures. Some of the checks contained memos indicating that the funds were spent on racetrack-related expenditures, while others had blank memos or merely contained the word “loan.” At trial, Savoie recalled signing only some of these checks and said he did not recognize all of the various payee names. Savoie testified that he had signed blank checks on behalf of Green Mountain during the course of the business venture because Wilby had asked him to do so. Savoie also testified that he did not authorize anyone to sign his name on checks drawn from the Green Mountain account. Vitali testified that he wrote the signatures on some of the checks, although Wilby, Emmett, and Savoie were the only authorized signatories on the account. Wilby and Emmett testified that they had given Vitali permission to execute their signatures; according to Vitali, he also had permission to sign Savoie’s name.', 'Vitali testified that he kept a “ledger” of the money that was spent on rehabilitating the racetrack. Vitali stated that his practice was to make a note of each check that he wrote, either on the ledger or on “a piece of paper or pad in my office, * * * or I’d use my checkbook, whatever.” Vitali’s ledger was included as a trial exhibit, and it contained more than 250 handwritten entries indicating payments with corresponding check numbers.', 'Attorney Foote’s Concerns', 'Wilby received a letter from Attorney Foote dated August 5, 1997, in which Attorney Foote advised Wilby that Green Mountain’s racing-license application must indicate whether any officers of the corporation had ever been arrested. Wilby testified that he had in fact been 15', 'Emmett testified that Vitali sometimes used Country Side Farms checks for Green Mountain expenses. Emmett also “vaguely” recalled checks being made out from Green Mountain to Country Side Farms, and that these checks were for “[a] multitude, just payroll, materials, and whatever it was that [Vitali] paid out” at Green Mountain.', '-8- arrested in 1971, but that he had forgotten about this arrest when he received the letter from Attorney Foote. 16 On August 19, 1997, Wilby and Emmett filed an “Application for License to Conduct Horse Race Meets with Pari-Mutuel Wagering” with the Vermont Racing Commission, on behalf of Green Mountain. The application contained the following question: “Has any officer, director, stockholder, or any employee of the corporation been arrested at any time for other than a minor traffic violation?” The applicants checked the box for “no” in response to this question.', 'Wilby received another letter from Attorney Foote dated December 10, 1997, in which Attorney Foote indicated that he was “not optimistic” about how the commission would react to Green Mountain’s application. This letter indicated that Attorney Foote was concerned about Green Mountain’s financial capacity. 17 Green Mountain also submitted a “Proposal” to the Vermont Racing Commission that contained estimated costs for the construction and renovation of the racetrack facility, with a total projected cost of $1,300,000. Additionally, Attorney Foote sent a “Memorandum for Lang Wilby” to Rizzo on January 10, 1998, in which he indicated that the commission “would want to know precisely where we planned to obtain the 1.3 to 1.5 million we had estimated it would cost to restore the track.” Attorney Foote’s memorandum did not contain a breakdown of this estimate. Wilby testified that, upon receiving this memorandum, he assigned Vitali the task of “looking into” the corporation’s financial issues. 16', 'Wilby testified that he had been arrested, charged, tried, and convicted on charges of aiding and abetting and moving stolen property. 17', 'The letter stated, in part:', '“Very frankly I am not optimistic as to what [the Commission’s]', 'reaction is going to be. However we have done, as far as I can see,', 'all we can do and if we don’t have enough to assure them it can', 'work it may be a fair signal that the risks involved exceed any to', 'which you should be exposing yourself.”', '-9-', 'Wilby did not tell Savoie about Attorney Foote’s letters and memorandum before Savoie became an investor. Savoie testified that, if he had known that Attorney Foote had raised concerns about persons being arrested and/or charged with crimes, he would not have invested in the corporation. Additionally, Savoie asserted that he would not have invested had he known about the financial concerns raised in Attorney Foote’s memorandum. Savoie also testified, however, that he did not ask to see any corporate records, did not ask about the corporation’s financial situation, and did not attempt to contact Attorney Foote before making his investment.', 'Savoie’s and Wilby’s Criminal Records', 'Savoie testified that he met with officers from the Vermont State Police in the summer of 1998, during the course of the police investigation of the principals involved in the racetrack venture. Savoie told the officers that he had a criminal record, specifically that he had pled guilty to a currency-violation charge in Vermont in 1980 and served sixty days in jail. 18 Savoie testified that he told Wilby about his criminal record before he invested in the racetrack venture, because he “knew we would be investigated,” and Wilby told him “not to worry about it.” Wilby, however, did not recall this conversation. Savoie did not ask, prior to investing, whether Wilby had a criminal record.', 'Wilby was also interviewed by the Vermont State Police in 1998, and the police asked whether he had a criminal record. After first denying that he had a record, Wilby eventually told the investigating officers that he had been charged in relation to an incident involving stolen property and had served one year of probation in 1970 or 1971. Wilby then told Savoie that the police had discovered his record, and Savoie told Wilby that he had also been investigated. Wilby testified that he, Savoie, Owens, and Vitali had a meeting with Attorney Foote at the 18', 'Savoie also testified that he had a second meeting with the Vermont State Police, but he could not recall any details about the encounter.', '- 10 - racetrack, at some point in the beginning of 1999, for the purpose of discussing Wilby’s and Savoie’s criminal records.', 'The License Application Withdrawal', 'In February 1999, Green Mountain submitted a “Withdrawal of Application for License to Conduct Horse Races or Meets with Pari-Mutuel Wagering” to the Vermont Racing Commission.19', 'This document stated two reasons for the withdrawal: an issue with “construction of a suitable sanitation plant,” and fire-code-compliance reconstruction that would cost “between 1.2 and 1.9 millions of dollars.” 20', 'The parties disputed whether Savoie was involved in the decision to withdraw Green Mountain’s license application. Wilby testified that in early 1999 there was a meeting at the racetrack, at which Wilby, Vitali, Rizzo, Attorney Foote, and Savoie were present, and the decision was made to withdraw the license application.', 'According to Wilby, Savoie was involved in the discussions that led to this decision. No records or minutes were produced from any meetings having to do with the withdrawal. Emmett testified that she was involved in a meeting in which the withdrawal decision was made, along with Vitali, Wilby, and Savoie. Emmett testified that she understood that the reason for the withdrawal was that Savoie’s and Wilby’s criminal records had “come to light,” and they thought it better to withdraw rather than be denied.', 'Vitali also recalled that there was a meeting concerning the Vermont State Police investigation. Vitali testified that Emmett and Savoie were present at this meeting, and the purpose was to discuss the severity of the criminal records with Attorney Foote. As a result of 19', 'Green Mountain had submitted its racing license application in August 1997. 20', 'Wilby testified that Owens had been responsible for establishing this numerical estimate. Wilby also testified that he was unsure of exactly how Owens had arrived at the estimate, and he said he did not make any inquiries about it.', '- 11 - that meeting, according to Vitali, the decision was made to withdraw the application. Vitali testified that it was understood that the commission was going to deny the application because of Wilby’s and Savoie’s criminal records. Vitali also testified that, at the time of the withdrawal, there were issues with the racetrack’s septic system and fire-code compliance.', 'Savoie, on the other hand, testified that he did not participate in any meetings in which the withdrawal of the license application was discussed and was never given an opportunity to vote on the matter. Savoie stated that, in February 1999, Wilby informed him at Lang’s Villa Rosa that the racetrack venture was no longer going to be pursued because the license application had been denied. Savoie testified that he did not ask Wilby why the application had purportedly been denied.', 'The Final $100,000', 'After the license application was withdrawn, $100,000 remained in Green Mountain’s bank account. According to Savoie, he and Wilby agreed to invest this money in the stock market. 21 Wilby “had a guy” who would invest the money; Savoie did not recall who this person was. Savoie did not know where the $100,000 was invested, and he did not ask. Wilby testified that he invested the money in the stock market, and that $62,000 was subsequently lost. Wilby could not recall the name of the brokerage firm or the last name of the broker, and he produced no records detailing this investment. At some point in 1999, Wilby and Vitali gave Savoie a check for the remaining $38,000, with the understanding that Savoie would invest it with his brother, Robert. Savoie’s brother refused to take the check or become involved, and Savoie deposited the check into his personal account at Pawtucket Credit Union. 21', 'Savoie also testified inconsistently, however, at one point stating that he was reluctant to make this investment.', '- 12 -', 'The Lawsuit', 'Wilby and Emmett filed a complaint against Savoie in Superior Court on May 29, 2002, seeking an accounting of the $38,000 that was supposedly invested on their behalf. Savoie counterclaimed for breach of fiduciary duty, 22 fraud, and breach of contract, seeking $312,000 in damages. 23 Wilby and Emmett’s complaint was dismissed for failure to comply with discovery, and the case proceeded to trial on Savoie’s counterclaims. After a five-day bench trial, judgment was entered for Wilby and Emmett on all counts. Savoie filed a timely appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires a trial justice in a nonjury * * * case ‘to make specific findings of fact upon which he [or she] bases his [or her] decision.’” Connor v.

The parties agree that Vermont law controls the substantive legal issues in this case.', 'A', 'Failure to Address Fraud and Fraudulent Concealment Claims', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by “d[oing] and sa[ying] nothing whatever concerning swaths of plaintiff’s fraud claim.” First, plaintiff argues that defendants induced plaintiff to invest in Green Mountain and led him to believe that he would be a part owner of the racetrack property, when in fact the corporation did not have any ownership rights to convey. According to plaintiff, “an offer to sell shares in a venture designed to develop a physical premises includes an implicit representation that the offeror has some form of legal right to the premises into which the investor’s money is to be poured.” The plaintiff contends that the trial justice found that defendants did not have a written lease for the racetrack property, “but failed then to draw the required legal conclusion: that, when defendants implicitly led plaintiff to believe that they had an interest in the track, they materially misled him.”', 'Next, plaintiff argues that the trial court entirely “disregarded” his claim of fraudulent concealment. The plaintiff claims that the trial justice erred by failing to address the issue of whether defendants had a legal duty to disclose information they had learned about the business prior to plaintiff’s involvement. The plaintiff argues that defendants had a “duty to disclose material information” to him, because they had been involved in the racetrack venture for approximately one year before plaintiff became an investor. The defendants, for their part, argue', '- 15 - that plaintiff failed to prove a necessary element of fraud or fraudulent concealment, namely that there was an intention to mislead or defraud.', 'Under Vermont law, “[t]he elements of fraud or intentional misrepresentation are * * * as follows: * * * ‘an intentional misrepresentation of existing fact, affecting the essence of the transaction, so long as the misrepresentation was false when made and known to be false by the maker, was not open to the defrauded party’s knowledge, and was relied on by the defrauded party to his damage.’” Silva v. Stevens, 589 A.2d 852, 857 (Vt. 1991) (quoting Union Bank v. Jones, 411 A.2d 1338, 1342 (Vt. 1980)). Fraudulent concealment, on the other hand, requires: “(1) concealment of facts, (2) affecting the essence of the transaction, (3) not open to the defrauded party’s knowledge, (4) by one with knowledge and a duty to disclose, (5) with the intent to mislead, and (6) detrimental reliance by the defrauded party.” Fuller v. Banknorth Mortgage Co., 788 A.2d 14, 16 (Vt. 2001). “A duty to disclose may arise ‘from the relations of the parties, such as that of trust or confidence, or superior knowledge or means of knowledge.’” Lay v. Pettengill, 38 A.3d 1139, 1144 (Vt. 2011) (quoting White v. Pepin, 561 A.2d 94, 96 (Vt. 1989)). “‘In arm’s-length transactions,’ however, ‘where facts are equally within the means of knowledge of both parties, neither party is required to speak, in the absence of inquiry respecting such matters.’” Id. (quoting White, 561 A.2d at 96).', 'Here, the trial justice found as fact that “all three of these principal parties, Wilby, Emmett and Savoie, met in an arm[’]s-length mutual desire to make an investment that they thought would have the possibility of reaping great rewards * * * .” The trial justice further found that “at least on one occasion [Savoie] met with the owner of the track, nearby business persons with whom he developed some personal relationship, and was well aware of the situation involving the extent of the project of developing, rehabilitating and operating the race track', '- 16 - facility.” The trial justice was “not impressed at all by the individual credibility of any of the principal witnesses, Langdon Wilby, Tammy Emmett, Marcus Vital[i] or Paul Savoie,” finding that “each of these witnesses testified to their involvement in this case with a light to cast each of them in the most favorable position possible.” The trial justice found “as a fact and as a matter of law that Mr. Savoie was a willing participant in the venture and that there was no material misrepresentation of fact or omissions of fact concerning Mr. Savoie’s participation that were knowingly designed to induce him to invest $350,000.”', 'Bearing in mind that “[a] trial justice’s analysis of the evidence and findings in the bench trial context need not be exhaustive,” we do not find merit in plaintiff’s argument that the trial justice failed to adequately address his fraud claim. See Notarantonio, 941 A.2d at 144-45 (quoting McBurney, 875 A.2d at 436). After a thorough review of the record, we do not find any evidence of the intention to misrepresent or defraud that is required for a claim of intentional misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment under Vermont law. Accordingly, the trial justice had no need to address the issue of whether defendants owed a legal duty to disclose information about the racetrack venture before Savoie became an investor, because the intent element of the fraudulent concealment claim was clearly missing. 24 As for intentional misrepresentation, the trial justice made factual findings regarding Wilby’s, Emmett’s, and Savoie’s pre-investment knowledge and behavior, and these findings comport with the conclusion that defendants did not intentionally mislead Savoie into believing that they had an interest in the racetrack property. We perceive no error in these factual findings.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s judgment on plaintiff’s fraud claim. 24', 'Nevertheless, the trial justice did find that this was an “arm[’]s-length” transaction, which supports the finding that defendants did not owe a special duty to plaintiff.', '- 17 -', 'B', 'Breach of Fiduciary Duty', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by “declin[ing] to hold defendants responsible for * * * breaches of fiduciary duty.” Specifically, plaintiff points to the evidence of payments made from the Green Mountain account to Wilby, Country Side Farms, and other third parties. The plaintiff also points to the evidence of “forgeries,” referring to the checks that Vitali signed allegedly on plaintiff’s behalf, and the loss of $62,000 from the final $100,000 that was invested through an unnamed broker. The plaintiff also notes various “managerial deficits,” such as the fact that papers were never filed to allow Green Mountain to be treated as a small-business corporation for income tax purposes, and the failure to secure a written lease of the racetrack property. The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by seemingly crediting this evidence of mismanagement and yet failing to hold defendants accountable to plaintiff for his resulting loss.', 'The plaintiff also argues that defendants were agents of the corporation, and that they had certain responsibilities as corporate fiduciaries due to their positions as officers. The plaintiff asserts that, as agents or fiduciaries, defendants had a duty to account for the corporation’s assets and a duty to disprove a presumption of negligence created by dispensing the corporation’s funds without proper documentation.', 'Thus, plaintiff suggests that defendants had the burden of proving that the funds spent from Green Mountain’s account were not misappropriated. The plaintiff asserts that the trial justice “let defendants off scot free, and instead faulted plaintiff for his inability to prove exactly how corporate funds were spent.” The plaintiff maintains that this was legal error because, “[w]hen defendants failed to provide records to justify the expenditure of Green Mountain funds, including multiple thousands of dollars paid to themselves, they breached their fiduciary duty to account, making them liable for the unexplained expenditures.”', '- 18 -', 'The defendants, for their part, dispute plaintiff’s contention regarding the trial justice’s findings on the issue of fiduciary duty. The defendants assert that the trial justice “did not conclude as a finding of fact or conclusion of law that Defendants’ actions constituted a breach of any fiduciary duty to Plaintiff.” The defendants also claim that plaintiff’s argument is not supported by the documentary evidence, such as Vitali’s payment ledger, the checks paid from Green Mountain’s account, and other documents that showed “the substantial time and effort invested by Defendants in the preparation of the [racing license application].”', 'Under Vermont law, “[d]irectors of a corporation are regarded as fiduciaries and are required to exercise their own independent judgment for the highest welfare of the corporation and its stockholders.” Vermont Department of Public Service v. Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., 558 A.2d 215, 224 (Vt. 1988) (quoting Stoneman v. Fox Film Corp., 4 N.E.2d 63, 66 (Mass. 1936)). Shareholders of a corporation may bring suit against directors for breach of fiduciary duties owed to the corporation; and, under Vermont law, “[t]he general principles governing shareholder suits are well settled. In a derivative suit, the shareholder sues on behalf of the corporation for harm done to the corporation; in a direct action, the shareholder brings suit individually, or on behalf of a class of shareholders, for injuries done to them in their individual capacities.” Bovee v. Lyndonville Savings Bank & Trust Co., 811 A.2d 143, 145 (Vt. 2002). “[A]ctions charging mismanagement which depress[ ] the value of stock [allege] a wrong to the corporation; i.e., the stockholders collectively, to be enforced by a derivative action.” Id. at 146 (quoting Kramer v. Western Pacific Industries, Inc., 546 A.2d 348, 353 (Del. 1988)). The Vermont Supreme Court has further held that “shareholders in a closely held corporation owe', '- 19 - one another a fiduciary duty of good faith and loyalty * * * .” P.F. Jurgs & Co. v. O’Brien, 629 A.2d 325, 331 (Vt. 1993). 25', 'The plaintiff cites principles of agency law for the proposition that the burden of proof should have shifted to defendants, requiring them to show that they did not misappropriate Green Mountain’s funds. In our opinion, this application of the law is misguided. Wilby and Emmett, as officers and directors of Green Mountain, were not agents of plaintiff; rather, they were agents of Green Mountain. The plaintiff here asserted his claim for breach of fiduciary duty directly on behalf of himself, not derivatively on behalf of the corporation; however, plaintiff cited no Vermont law suggesting that there would be a shift in the burden of proof in a direct suit for breach of fiduciary duty between co-shareholder-directors of a closely held corporation. We are satisfied, therefore, that the trial justice did not err by requiring plaintiff to prove misappropriation of corporate funds by a preponderance of the evidence.', 'Next, we address the issue of whether the trial justice found a breach of fiduciary duty and, if not, whether this finding was clearly erroneous. In his twenty-one-page decision, the trial justice acknowledged that Green Mountain “was extremely poorly run, without adhering to common reasonable business practices of accounting, tax filing and reporting, etc.,” but found that Savoie was “well aware of the business venture and its pitfalls and possible reward.” The trial justice also found as fact that Savoie had visited the racetrack more frequently than he admitted, and that he “was well aware of the situation involving the extent of the project of 25', 'The trial justice found that “[Green Mountain] was a closely held corporation,” and this finding is not challenged on appeal. We assume, therefore, that plaintiff’s claims were asserted against defendants for breach of their “fiduciary dut[ies] of good faith and loyalty” stemming from their positions as co-shareholders of a closely held corporation, see P.F. Jurgs & Co. v. O’Brien, 629 A.2d 325, 331 (Vt. 1993), rather than as claims for breach of fiduciary duties owed to the corporation and its stockholders stemming from defendants’ capacities as directors. See Vermont Department of Public Service v. Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., 558 A.2d 215, 224 (Vt. 1988).', '- 20 - developing, rehabilitating and operating the race track facility.” Further, the trial justice found that Savoie was aware that standards of corporate accountability were not being met, that Vitali was signing Savoie’s name on checks drawn from the Green Mountain account, and that payments were being made to other third parties. While the trial justice was “dismayed at the lack of recordkeeping, accountancy and travel of the funds from the ledger book and checkbook,” he was “not convinced by a fair preponderance of the evidence that these funds were misappropriated and put into anyone’s pocket.” Ultimately, the trial justice noted that while he was “aware of the corporate duties and the fiduciary duty of officers of corporations to their stockholders and shareholders, * * * in this particular instance * * * all three of these stockholders and directors were pretty much in the same boat * * * .”', 'After reviewing the trial justice’s decision, we are of the opinion that he did not find that defendants breached any fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff. While the trial justice did list a litany of ways in which the corporation was poorly run, he explicitly stated that “Plaintiff has failed to prove by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that the Defendants were negligent as to him and the operation of the corporation * * * .” Additionally, while the trial justice found the loss of $62,000 from the corporation’s final $100,000 to be “extremely troublesome,” he also found that, “[a]bsent any hard evidence as to where that money did go, the [c]ourt is without the ability to make a determination that it was embezzled or otherwise unjustly enriched by Wilby or Ms. Emmett.”', 'After a thorough review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence and that his findings on the issue of fiduciary duty were not clearly erroneous. The record reveals that the testimonies of Wilby, Vitali, Emmett, and Savoie were replete with inconsistencies and vague recollections of even the most basic facts', '- 21 - surrounding Green Mountain’s management. The witnesses’ hazy presentations of the events certainly allowed for the conclusion that Savoie was more involved in the racetrack venture than he claimed. Additionally, the parties do not dispute that plaintiff was a member of Green Mountain’s board of directors, that he willingly invested in the corporation despite cautionary advice from his financial-analyst brother, and that he failed to conduct even a cursory investigation into the corporation’s prospective chances for success. We cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong in finding that defendants, while apparently ineffectual in their ability to rehabilitate the racetrack, breached any fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff, who also bore responsibilities as a corporate director and apparently failed to make any attempts to remedy the corporation’s mismanagement. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s judgment on plaintiff’s claim of breach of fiduciary duty.', 'C', 'Savoie’s Knowledge of and Participation in the Mismanagement of Green Mountain', 'Finally, plaintiff argues that the trial justice’s factual findings were clearly wrong with regard to plaintiff’s knowledge and participation in the mismanagement of the Green Mountain venture. First, plaintiff argues that he carried out only “menial tasks” at the racetrack and that “[t]hese activities would not even arguably have exposed plaintiff to defendants’ record-keeping deficits or to the nature of the checks they were writing to themselves and others.” According to plaintiff, the trial justice “acted unreasonably and without any evidentiary support” when he found that plaintiff “was well aware” of defendants’ mismanagement of Green Mountain. Second, plaintiff argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong in finding that plaintiff and defendants, as stockholders and directors of the corporation, “were pretty much in the same boat.” The plaintiff lists a litany of alleged differences between defendants and himself in', '- 22 - relation to their corporate capacities, including plaintiff’s status as an inactive director, plaintiff’s nonparticipation in spending corporate funds, and plaintiff’s lack of responsibility for corporate recordkeeping. Third, plaintiff argues that the trial justice’s conclusions regarding the parties’ criminal records were clearly wrong. The plaintiff asserts that Wilby and plaintiff were not similarly situated with regard to the implications of their criminal records, because Wilby failed to disclose his record on Green Mountain’s license application, whereas plaintiff was not involved in the application process. 26', 'The trial justice laid out a detailed description of the facts underlying this case, and he noted the areas where the parties’ versions of the facts diverged. He pointed out the distinction between Savoie’s assertion that he visited the racetrack on only two or three occasions, and Wilby’s and Vitali’s assertions that Savoie “was a constant presence at the race track facility.” The trial justice also noted the parties’ disagreement over whether Savoie was ever an officer of the corporation and the lack of corporate paperwork to verify Savoie’s status.', 'He noted disagreement over how many corporate meetings were held with Savoie present, particularly the meeting where the decision was made to withdraw the license application. The trial justice also noted disagreement as to whether Savoie allowed Vitali to sign his name on corporate checks, as well as whether Savoie and Wilby were aware of each other’s criminal records.', 'After detailing the discrepancies in the parties’ various versions of the facts, the trial justice found that Savoie, “as a shareholder and director, even though he may not have been a 26', 'The plaintiff notes that the trial justice erroneously stated that plaintiff had served a sixty-day sentence in the State of Nevada for “obtaining money under false pretenses,” whereas plaintiff stated at trial that he had served a sixty-day sentence in the State of Vermont for a currency violation. The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice erred by noting that “Wilby denied withholding from plaintiff the contents of [Attorney] Foote’s warnings,” when in fact Wilby admitted that he did not disclose this information. We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s misstatements as to these matters do not amount to clearly erroneous findings or misconceptions of material evidence.', '- 23 - director who was intricately involved in the development of this venture * * * was well aware of the business venture and its pitfalls and possible reward.” The trial justice found that Savoie “knew that Marcus Vital[i] was running the operation in Vermont,” and that Savoie’s testimony “shad[ed] to his advantage the number of times that he was at that track.” The trial justice also found that Wilby and Savoie did not inform each other of their criminal records.', 'As noted by the trial justice, the record of this case indicates that the parties presented diverging versions of the facts and that there was “a patent lack of recollection on the part of all of the main witnesses.” In performing his duties of fact-finding in a nonjury trial, the trial justice necessarily weighed the credibility of the witnesses and selected what he found to be the most reliable version of the disputed facts. After careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice ably waded through this quagmire of faulty memories and opaque testimonies, and that he neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence, nor were his factual findings clearly erroneous.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

What is before this Court for review is whether outdoor decks in a condominium development are common elements, to be repaired as a common expense, or parts of the individual units, the repair of which is chargeable to the individual unit owners.', 'When the oldest units in the thirty-three-unit Moorland Farm Condominium required repairs to their decks, the repairs were treated as common expenses. Accordingly, the repair costs were assessed to all unit owners.', 'The owners of those condominium units that were not benefiting from the improvements protested. Eventually, they filed a declaratory-judgment action in Superior Court in which they sought a declaration that the assessments were illegal. After a bench trial, a justice of that court issued a decision in which he found that the assessments were indeed not proper.', 'The defendant Moorland Farm Condominium Association timely appealed, arguing that the trial justice erred in several respects. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The Moorland Farm Condominium (Moorland Farm) in Newport was established in 1980 by a declaration of condominium. It consists of thirty-three units in ten buildings. The units were constructed in three phases: Phase I was already completed when the declaration was executed; Phases II and III were constructed later and added to the project by amendment to the declaration. The units in Moorland Farm’s various phases differ not only in when they were constructed, but also in their size, amenities, and configuration. Phase I contains both larger “B Units” and smaller “A Units”; on the other hand, Phase II and Phase III contain only the smaller “A Units.” 1', 'In addition to establishing Moorland Farm itself, the declaration of condominium established defendant Moorland Farm Condominium Association (the association). According to the declaration, it is the responsibility and function of the association to “manage and regulate” Moorland Farm. All condominium unit owners are members of the association. The bylaws of the association established a management committee through which the association would act. Among the powers that the bylaws bestow upon the management committee is the power to levy assessments on the individual unit owners for the maintenance of Moorland Farm, such as “[o]peration, maintenance, cleaning, and care of the common areas and facilities,” and “[d]etermin[ing] the common expenses required for the affairs of [Moorland Farm].” However, this authority is not unfettered; the management committee is permitted to “expend common funds only for common expenses and lawful purposes * * * .” 1', 'Although the parties’ stipulation of agreed upon facts and the decision of the Superior Court say that the “A Units” are larger than the “B Units,” the declaration’s provisions make clear that the larger units are “B Units.”', '-2-', 'In 2005 or 2006, the management committee became aware that certain decks in Moorland Farm were in need of repair, so it engaged an engineering firm to determine the extent of the work. At the same time, the management committee investigated the means by which it might fund those repairs. Eventually, between 2006 and 2008, the management committee issued a series of special assessments, the proceeds of which were to be used for the ailing decks.', 'The first special assessment was in the amount of $205,600; it was allocated to pay for repairs to decks attached to four Phase I condominium units. The second special assessment was for $500,000, and it was allocated to pay for repairs to decks attached to the eight remaining Phase I units. The third special assessment was in the amount of $180,000, and it was allocated, in part, to pay for repairs to Phase I buildings. The fourth assessment was in the amount of $100,050. With each of the assessments, the six larger “B Units,” which are located exclusively in Phase I, were allocated a higher percentage of the assessment than did the smaller “A Units,” six of which are located in Phase I and the remaining twenty-one of which are located in Phases II and III. 2', 'The plaintiffs, all of whom either own units or serve as the trustees of trusts that own units in Phase II or Phase III, objected to being assessed to pay for repairs to Phase I units, specifically, the decks, pocket decks, and entry court areas of Phase I units. 3 They demonstrated their disagreement by filing an action in the Superior Court.', 'The complaint named the 2', 'As described above, the nomenclature used to describe the units in Moorland Farm is somewhat inconsistent. Nonetheless, there is no dispute that the larger units were assigned a higher amount for each of the four special assessments because they have a larger “approximate assignable area” than the smaller units. 3', 'The term “pocket deck” refers to a deck that is located on the second floor of condominium units. Rather than extending beyond the interior footprint of a unit, pocket decks sit above living space and are set into a condominium unit’s roof. The “entry court area” of a unit is enclosed outdoor space immediately adjacent to the units that includes the steps leading to the front door of the unit.', '-3- association and the individual members of the management committee, in their capacity as members of that body, as defendants. The second amended complaint sought a declaration that the four special assessments were illegal because, plaintiffs alleged, the decks were neither common areas nor limited common areas, but rather were part of individual units. 4 In addition, plaintiffs sought reimbursement of any amounts that had been paid towards the assessments. Further, plaintiffs requested that the court “order defendants to reassess the four * * * special assessments to the individual unit owners whose properties specifically benefited from the illegal assessments” and, if those reassessments were not paid, to file liens against the benefited units pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-36-19.', 'Significantly, in their answer defendants raised the affirmative defense that plaintiffs had failed to join necessary and indispensable parties.', 'Moreover, when the trial was about to commence, the attorney for one of the management committee defendants pointed out to the trial justice that not all the necessary parties had been named in the action. Specifically, he told the trial justice that any reimbursement to plaintiffs “[wa]s going to come from other unit owners, and none of those unit owners [we]re before the [c]ourt.” The trial justice did not respond to the statement of counsel but instructed plaintiffs’ attorney to call his first witness.', 'At the conclusion of the trial, the trial justice issued a written decision. In it, he ruled that jurisdiction in the matter was based on the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9.

He also determined that, “based on the 4', 'The four-count second amended complaint also included claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the Condominium Ownership Act. These counts were voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Rule 41 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, so only the declaratory-judgment count was decided by the trial justice. This stipulation also dismissed the management committee defendants from the case.', '-4- clear and unambiguous language of the [condominium] documents, as well as the Condominium Act, * * * the decks are part of the individual condominium units.” As a result, the trial justice held, the four assessments were illegal.', 'A judgment was entered reflecting the written decision. The judgment ordered the association to “vacate [the] assessments and reassess the costs covered in the four special assessments.” Importantly, the judgment specifically ordered that “[i]n such reassessment, [the association] shall allocate the costs * * * of the deck replacement project * * * to the individual unit owners whose decks and entry court areas were replaced or repaired.” The association timely appealed to this Court, asserting myriad errors.', 'In its appeal, the association argues that the trial justice should not have allowed the case to proceed to trial because there were indispensable parties who had not been joined in the action. Further, it argues that the trial justice erred when, in deciding the merits of the case, he determined that the decks were part of the individual units; when he excluded the affidavit of an expert witness; and when he refused to grant relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Finally, the association claims that the trial justice erred when he imposed a sanction against it for bringing the Rule 60(b) motion. We will supply additional facts where necessary to decide the issues before us.', 'II', 'Indispensable Parties', 'First, the association argues that the trial justice committed error by advancing to trial in the absence of all indispensable parties. Specifically, the association asserts that the lawsuit’s critical defect is its failure to include the Phase I unit owners who received the benefit of the association’s assessment for deck repairs but who would bear the financial burden of the', '-5- reallocated costs as set forth in the judgment. Conversely, plaintiffs maintain that the association is the only necessary defendant because the judgment imposes an obligation only upon the association to reallocate and reassess the deck repairs. Therefore, they argue, the individual Phase I owners are not indispensable parties. Any unit owner’s responsibility to pay legal assessments, according to plaintiffs, is a contractual obligation that is based on the declaration, and not on the result of this action.', 'Section 9-30-11 provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.” This requirement furthers the purpose of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, chapter 30 of title 9, which is “to facilitate the termination of controversies.” Abbatematteo v. State, 694 A.2d 738, 740 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Thompson v. Town Council of Westerly, 487 A.2d 498, 499 (R.I. 1985)).', 'We have held that the above-cited provision in § 9-30-11 is mandatory. Thompson, 487 A.2d at 499; In re City of Warwick, 97 R.I. 294, 296, 197 A.2d 287, 288 (1964). Therefore, “[o]rdinarily ‘failure to join all persons who have an interest that would be affected by the declaration’ is fatal.” Abbatematteo, 694 A.2d at 740 (quoting Thompson, 487 A.2d at 499).', 'In Abbatematteo, 694 A.2d at 739, certain participants in the Employees’ Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island sued (1) for a declaration that the retirement system’s payment of more generous benefits to some retirees was unconstitutional and (2) for an injunction putting an end to those payments. The retirees allegedly receiving more generous benefits, however, were not made parties to the case. Id. at 740. We affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of the action, reasoning that the absent retirees were indispensable because', '-6- “[d]isposition of the action in [the] plaintiffs’ favor * * * would reduce or eliminate pension benefits for th[e] ‘favored’ members of the retirement system.” Id.', 'Similarly, a declaratory-judgment action in In re City of Warwick, 97 R.I. at 295-97, 197 A.2d at 287-89, was incurably defective because of the absence of all of the municipal board members whose appointments were at issue. In that case, the mayor sought a declaration as to whether the municipal charter or general statutes controlled the selection of members of certain municipal boards. Id. at 295-96, 197 A.2d at 287-88. This Court held that the mayor was required to have included all members of the boards in that action because their absence “deprive[d] the decree appealed from of any binding effect as to [them] * * * and could in the future lead to needless litigation if the rights declared [in that case] were attempted to be enforced against them.” Id. at 296-97, 197 A.2d at 288. We rejected the contention that any board member’s absence could be excused because a member of each of the relevant boards appeared at the hearing and represented the interests of their co-members. Id. at 297, 197 A.2d at 288-89.', 'We also have required joinder where the “interest” that “would be affected by the declaration” was not the reduction of retirement benefits or the potential termination of a term on a municipal board, but rather a city council member’s interest in the municipal budget process. See Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 749-50, 754 (R.I. 1997). In Sullivan, a dispute over the annual budget caused some members of the city council to seek declaratory relief, and, although we held that the case was moot, we also said that the failure to include the entire nine-member council was “fatal to their declaratory-judgment action.” Id. at 754.', 'In the case before us, plaintiffs have not sued the owners of the Phase I units whose decks were repaired, yet the complaint sought and the judgment specifically decrees that the', '-7- association “allocate the costs” to them. We cannot fathom how those unit owners do not “have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration.” See § 9-30-11. Similarly, because “no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding,” § 9- 30-11, the fact that these unit owners are being ordered to bear an additional burden even though they were not part of the case undermines the purpose of declaratory-judgment actions, which is “to facilitate the termination of controversies.”', 'Abbatematteo, 694 A.2d at 740 (quoting Thompson, 487 A.2d at 499). The omission of those parties was raised both as an affirmative defense in the association’s answer and on the record on the day of trial. 5 The case should not have proceeded without those parties whose interests would be affected by the declaration.', 'Although this Court has not previously had the opportunity to consider this issue in the context of a condominium development, we do find support for our conclusion in the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions that have decided it. In one case, owners of condominium units that were located in buildings that were not equipped with elevators sued for declaratory relief after their condominium association assessed the cost of elevator repairs to all units. Epstein v. Villa Dorado Condominium Association, Inc., 316 S.W.3d 457, 458-59 (Mo. Ct. App. 2010). The court held, based on statutory language identical to our own, that the failure to join all owners who lacked elevator access was destructive to the cause of action because the absent owners “had an obvious interest in any judicial declaration regarding the elevators.” Id. at 461.', 'In another case with facts similar to those before us, the Court of Appeals of Ohio, albeit in an unpublished opinion, reviewed a declaratory-judgment action brought by some condominium owners who had been assessed for repairs to the balconies of other condominium 5', 'We empathize with the trial justice and recognize the difficult position in which he found himself when, on the morning of trial, he was presented with the argument that the case was gravely defective.', '-8- owners. See Cerio v. Hilroc Condominium Unit Owners Association, Inc., No. 83309, 2004 WL 529106 at *1 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2004). That court, also applying a statute similar to § 9- 30-11, held that the unit owners whose condominiums had balconies were necessary parties, explaining that “th[ose] unit owners with balconies [we]re * * * individually responsible for the cost of the repair and maintenance of the balconies, whereas the cost was previously to be shared by the entire association.” Cerio, 2004 WL 529106 at *3.', 'The Court in Cerio, 2004 WL 529106 at *3, also observed that the absence of all necessary owners created the possibility of piecemeal litigation because two separate groups could have pursued litigation. Absent owners without balconies could have sued, as did the Cerio plaintiffs themselves, to avoid the original assessment, and absent owners with balconies could have sued to avoid their new, higher repair costs. Id. Similarly, in this case, the Phase I unit owners who were not joined could sue to avoid paying the reassessments ordered by the judgment in this case. Such a result is antithetical to the purpose of declaratory-judgment actions. See § 9-30-6 (“The court may refuse to render or enter a declaratory judgment or decree where the judgment or decree, if rendered or entered, would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”); In re City of Warwick, 97 R.I. at 296-97, 197 A.2d at 288; see also Cerio, 2004 WL 529106 at *3.', 'We are constrained to follow our consistent pronouncements regarding mandatory joinder in declaratory-judgment actions. Therefore, we hold that the failure to join indispensable parties in this case was fatal and that the judgment is null and void. 6 As a consequence of that holding, 6', 'Our statutes and cases make clear that the Phase I unit owners should have been joined in this case. In Abbatematteo v. State, 694 A.2d 738, 740 (R.I. 1997), we did not base our holding on the number, either large or small, of retirees who were absent from the case. We previously have assumed without deciding that joinder might be excused if it would be impracticable because the parties to be joined were too numerous or service would be “unreasonabl[y] burden[some].” See', '-9- the remaining issues relating to the merits of this dispute have been rendered moot, and we need not, and shall not, reach them.', 'III', 'Sanctions', 'We will, however, review the association’s contention that the trial justice abused his discretion when he sanctioned it under the provisions of Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure as a result of its filing of a Rule 60(b) motion. Although the judgment from which the association’s Rule 60(b) motion sought relief has been vacated, the propriety of the sanction remains before us.', 'The United States Supreme Court has held that the imposition of sanctions is a “collateral issue” that may be determined independently from “the merits of an action.” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 396 (1990). Specifically, the Supreme Court said that “a Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action” but instead “requires a determination of a collateral issue: whether the attorney has abused the judicial process, and, if so, what sanction would be appropriate.” Cooter & Gell, 496 U.S. at 396. That is because “the ‘violation of Rule 11 is complete when the paper is filed.’” Cooter & Gell, 496 U.S. at 395 (quoting Szabo Food Service, Inc. v. Canteen Corp., 823 F.2d 1073, 1077 (7th Cir. 1987)).', 'After the entry of judgment, the association hired an accounting firm, Kahn, Litwin, Renza & Co.

The plaintiffs objected to the motion and asked the trial justice to impose sanctions on the association pursuant to Rule 11.', 'The trial justice denied the Rule 60 motion and sanctioned the association, determining that the motion was without foundation in fact or law and had been filed in bad faith for the purpose of delay and to harass plaintiffs.

She was slowing down in order to change lanes 2 when her car was struck from behind by a car operated by defendant Christopher Cariello. 3 The plaintiff testified that, after being struck, “[her] car lunged forward” and that “[her] head went way back.”', 'Immediately after the accident, plaintiff was brought to the emergency room of Rhode Island Hospital but was released to return to her home later that day. A few days after, she went to the emergency room of Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, because of pain in her back and legs. The plaintiff’s back pain persisted without improvement, leading her to consult a series of doctors and chiropractors in the years following the accident. 4 The plaintiff underwent two surgical procedures on her spine, the first in April 2005 and the second in March 2008.', 'The plaintiff filed the instant suit on February 2, 2006. A jury trial was held in the Providence County Superior Court between October 19 and 25, 2011. At trial, state police officer Simon Liu, who investigated the accident, testified that the accident occurred when defendant’s vehicle struck plaintiff’s vehicle from the rear while traveling in the right lane of Route 95. The plaintiff then testified as to the circumstances of the accident. She explained that she “was in the right most [sic] lane of the * * * two lanes that were through traffic,” not counting the exit lanes, when the accident occurred. 2', 'There is some dispute as to which lane the accident occurred in, as will be discussed hereafter. 3', 'The vehicle was registered to James Cariello, Christopher’s father, but it was used by Christopher, with his father’s permission, as Christopher’s primary vehicle. 4', 'The plaintiff’s extensive medical records from her ongoing treatment were submitted into evidence at trial as full exhibits.', '-2-', 'She testified that, prior to the accident, she had been largely self-sufficient, able to do her own shopping, house-cleaning, and laundry, as well as working full-time in a mailroom. 5 She explained that, after the accident, she was no longer able to be self-sufficient and was not able to return to work because of the pain. Kevin Cordeiro, a longtime friend of plaintiff’s, corroborated plaintiff’s testimony, averring that, before the accident, plaintiff had been an active person but that now she was unable to perform everyday tasks, could no longer drive, and was in pain. The plaintiff’s sister, Linda Shippee, also testified that “she [plaintiff] can’t walk and exercise. She used to go shopping more. She used to get out more.” The plaintiff’s brother-in-law, Willie Detonnayo, summarized plaintiff’s life after the accident as being “helpless and hopeless.” 6', 'In addition, plaintiff submitted the testimony of two expert witnesses. The first, Dr. Allan Feldman, an economist, testified as to plaintiff’s economic loss as a result of her injury. He estimated that plaintiff’s economic losses, assuming part-time employment, amounted to $99,000 and, if full-time employment were assumed, would be $284,000.', 'The plaintiff’s second expert witness, Dr. Edward Feldmann, a neurologist, testified as to plaintiff’s injuries. He stated that he reviewed plaintiff’s medical records and also examined her professionally on April 30, 2011. He summarized plaintiff’s medical history, noting that she had no history of lower back pain prior to the accident in 2003 and that her back pain, as a result of damage to a disc of her spine, prevented her from working. He further stated that her medical records revealed that plaintiff had degenerative disc disease, which he characterized as being common to the general population and often asymptomatic, and which likely preexisted the accident. Doctor Edward Feldmann also explained that asymptomatic degenerative disc disease could be made symptomatic as a result of trauma. He diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from an 5', 'The plaintiff has been legally deaf since birth. 6', 'John Birchall, an automobile appraiser, also testified on behalf of plaintiff.', '-3- injury to the spinal disc and nerve roots, a condition called radiculopathy, as well as from lumbosacral disc disease. He opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the injury was caused by the accident in September 2003. He also concluded it to be more likely than not that plaintiff’s injury was permanent and that it would be unlikely that plaintiff would ever be able to return to work.', 'The plaintiff also submitted into evidence her extensive medical records as well as affidavits from four medical professionals all of whom had provided medical services to her in the years following the accident. Each of the affiants stated that plaintiff’s various medical treatments were necessary as a result of the September 2003 accident.', 'The defendant, Christopher Cariello, testified that he was merging onto the on-ramp when he saw plaintiff “driving * * * in the right lane erratically, slowly, not following along at 50 miles an hour with traffic * * *.” He stated that his speed at impact was about ten miles per hour and that his speed on the on-ramp was twenty miles per hour.', 'The defendants then offered the expert testimony of Dr. Thomas Morgan, a neurologist. Doctor Morgan had not examined plaintiff himself but he conducted a medical records review, as well as a review of the accident reports, and rendered his opinion as to her medical condition. He agreed that plaintiff had a preexisting “moderate advanced degenerative disc disease.” He opined that plaintiff suffered pulled neck muscles as a result of the accident, which he characterized as “a typical whiplash scenario” from a rear-end motor vehicle accident. He stated that generally whiplash injuries are minor and have an average healing time of a few days to a few weeks, as long as there is no neurological damage associated with them. He testified that his review of the medical records and his experience with rear-end motor vehicle accidents do not support a finding that the accident aggravated plaintiff’s preexisting degenerative disc disease.', '-4- Doctor Morgan did agree that an asymptomatic condition could be rendered symptomatic as a result of trauma but disagreed with Dr. Edward Feldmann’s testimony and the opinions of plaintiff’s treating physicians that the accident caused plaintiff’s back problems.', 'After the parties rested, the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff, awarding damages to her in the amount of $193,584 and finding that defendant was 75 percent at fault in causing the accident. Judgment was entered to that effect on October 25, 2011.', 'On October 27, 2011, plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial and/or additur on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the jury’s award of damages failed to adequately compensate plaintiff for her injuries so as to shock the conscience. After oral argument on November 15, 2011, the trial justice issued a written decision on January 26, 2012.', 'In his decision, he summarized the evidence at trial, noting that the trial took place eight years after the accident occurred. The trial justice recognized the discrepancy in the testimony as to the lane in which the accident took place but stated that he was “inclined to believe that this [discrepancy] resulted from the lengthy span of time between the day of the accident and the trial” and further, that “there might have been confusion in the witnesses’ recollection regarding a nearby exit lane and whether or not to count this as a travelling lane.” Notwithstanding those inconsistencies, the trial justice found plaintiff’s testimony to be credible. The trial justice also stated that the apportionment of negligence between the parties was not against the preponderance of the evidence and would, therefore, not be disturbed.', 'The trial justice went on to review the conflicting expert testimony of Dr. Edward Feldmann and Dr. Morgan both as to plaintiff’s medical condition and whether the accident had caused it.', 'He also considered the evidence of plaintiff’s primary treating physician, Dr.', '-5- Frederick Harrington, although he noted that Dr. Harrington had not given an opinion as to the causation of plaintiff’s injuries.', 'The trial justice found that “[t]he jury’s award of $193,584 shock[ed] the conscience of this [c]ourt in its failure to respond to the merits of this issue and in its failure to administer substantial justice.” He noted that the award failed to “cover [p]laintiff’s medical bills, lost wages or any pain and suffering.” 7', 'The trial justice went on to suggest reasons for the inadequacy of the award, finding it likely that either the jury erroneously considered plaintiff’s health insurance coverage or that the jury disregarded the testimony as to the potential for exacerbation of a preexisting condition and, consequently, undervalued the severity of the injuries sustained by plaintiff. Accordingly, he granted an additur of $428,416 to the jury award for a total award of $622,000 and alternatively, if defendants rejected the additur, granted plaintiff’s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages only. An order to that effect entered on February 10, 2012.', 'The defendants filed a notice of appeal to this Court on February 10, 2012, and thereafter, on February 23, 2012, rejected the additur granted by the Superior Court. 8 Because defendants rejected the additur, it is not an issue on appeal before this Court. Accordingly, we will address only defendants’ appeal of the trial justice’s grant of the motion for a new trial on the issue of damages. 7', 'The plaintiff’s total medical expenses amounted to $269,000. 8', 'The defendants filed a motion to stay the judgment of the Superior Court with this Court on February 21, 2012. This Court granted the stay conditioned upon the filing of a supersedeas bond in the Superior Court.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Our standard for reviewing a trial justice’s decision in a motion for a new trial is well settled. “A trial justice’s role in considering a motion for a new trial is that of a superjuror, who must weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Gomes v.

The defendants emphasize the discrepancies in the testimony as to which lane the accident occurred in, arguing that the jury’s verdict finding plaintiff to be 25 percent at fault could only be explained by the jury’s not finding plaintiff to be credible. The defendants also assert that plaintiff’s medical records, in particular those of her primary treating physician, Dr. Harrington, contradict plaintiff’s own testimony as to her medical condition.', 'We begin by noting, as defendants acknowledge, that the trial justice accepted the apportionment of liability between the parties. The issue of liability is, accordingly, not before this Court. To the extent that defendants rely on the discrepancies in the testimonies as to which lane the accident occurred in to challenge the determination of plaintiff’s overall credibility, we will briefly address defendants’ argument. We note that the trial justice explicitly recognized these inconsistencies but ultimately concluded that plaintiff was a credible witness. We do not ordinarily second-guess a trial justice’s credibility determination of a witness’s testimony. This Court is limited to reading from an inanimate transcript of the record. As we have stated, “it is the trial justice who has the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses * * *.”', '-8- Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v.

In his decision, the trial justice summarized the expert testimony and carefully considered the evidence of Dr. Harrington as to plaintiff’s surgeries and the fact that Dr. Harrington characterized plaintiff’s symptoms when she returned to him for treatment after the first surgery as being “debilitating, unremitting and severe” pain. We are of the opinion that the trial justice more than adequately set forth sufficient record evidence to support his independent judgment.', 'The defendants make much of some discrepancies between plaintiff’s testimony at trial about her physical condition and the evidence in plaintiff’s medical records, in particular the fact that Dr. Harrington’s report on plaintiff’s progress after her first surgery was that she had very little pain and an excellent range of motion while plaintiff testified that she was still in pain after the surgery. We are not persuaded by this argument. We note that her testimony that she obtained no relief from her first surgery appears to be supported by the fact that plaintiff’s medical records clearly establish that she needed and underwent a second back surgery within three years of her first one.', 'The trial justice deemed plaintiff’s testimony to be credible. Moreover, the trial justice explicitly clarified that Dr. Harrington’s report on plaintiff’s progress was for the period “about or around the time of the surgery.” In any event, we have made it clear that “the trial justice need not engage in an exhaustive review and analysis of all of the evidence', '-9- and testimony presented at trial * * * [but] need only make reference to such facts disclosed by the testimony as have motivated his or her conclusion.”', 'Bonn, 11 A.3d at 78 (quoting Bourdon’s, Inc. v.

Our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that the trial justice engaged in the proper analysis in passing on the weight of the evidence and we agree with his conclusions.', 'The defendants finally contend that “[t]he mere fact that the jury award is less than the plaintiff’s total claimed damages is * * * an insufficient and incorrect reason to grant an [a]dditur or a [m]otion [f]or [n]ew [t]rial.” The defendants also ascribe error to the trial justice’s surmise regarding the basis of the inadequacy of the jury award.', 'We will accord great deference to a trial justice’s finding that a jury’s award of damages “shocks the conscience of the court.” See English, 787 A.2d at 1150. Here, the trial justice stated that the award was “inadequate,” explaining that it “does not cover [p]laintiff’s medical bills, lost wages or any pain and suffering.” Although the trial justice did not expressly discredit the expert testimony of Dr. Morgan, his findings and discussion of the damage award make it clear that he did not accept Dr. Morgan’s assessment of plaintiff’s injuries and the cause of plaintiff’s ongoing back problems. We note that the trial justice specifically added that Dr. Morgan acknowledged that a preexisting condition can be exacerbated due to trauma inflicted by an accident and did not completely discount that possibility. We cannot conclude based on our review of the evidence that the trial justice was clearly wrong in his determination that the jury’s award of damages was inadequate. Accordingly, we will not disturb his decision on review.', 'We are further satisfied that the trial justice’s surmises as to the basis of the inadequacy of the award were not error. Having already concluded that the jury award was so inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court, it was within his discretion to grant a new trial as to', '- 10 - damages for that reason.

75,"Carmella Bucci : v. : Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC et : al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC d/b/a Regine Pontiac GMC, and Hurd Chevrolet, Inc. (collectively Hurd or defendant), terminated the employment of Carmella Bucci, the plaintiff, when she was seventy-two years old. After it had hired the plaintiff twice at the age of sixty-seven for brief periods of employment, the defendant rehired Bucci, then aged sixty-eight, as a titles and registrations clerk. She then worked for a period of four years before Hurd terminated her for the final time. Bucci filed suit in Superior Court alleging, inter alia, that the defendant fired her due to unlawful age and disability discrimination in violation of G.L. 1956 § 28-5-1, the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA). A justice of the Superior Court granted summary judgment to Hurd, and Bucci timely appealed to this Court. We are called upon to determine if the parties have met their burdens under the now familiar McDonnell-Douglas framework so that we may', '-1- discern if summary judgment was appropriate. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant hired Bucci on three different occasions, the first of which was as a part- time receptionist when Bucci was sixty-seven years old. That employment ended one month later because her services were no longer needed. In August 2001, Bucci was rehired, this time to work as the titles and registrations clerk. In this capacity, plaintiff was responsible for filing the necessary paperwork to transfer titles and registrations to the vehicles that defendant had purchased, sold, or leased.', 'It was her task to resolve discrepancies, locate any missing documents, notarize titles, and send appropriate documentation to the various state registries of motor vehicles. At least once or twice per day, plaintiff interacted with customers in an effort to resolve issues pertaining to the registering of vehicles.', 'The defendant terminated Bucci’s employment in November 2001, after it received complaints from customers through Hurd’s finance and insurance and internet/e-mail departments. That, however, did not bring Bucci’s employment history with Hurd to an end. In August 2002, at the suggestion of one of her former supervisors at a different dealership, Hurd hired Bucci for the third time to again serve as the titles and registrations clerk. At that time, Bucci was sixty-eight years old.', 'At the beginning of her third employment period, defendant provided Bucci with its employee handbook, which stated in relevant part that “our employment-at-will policy permit[s] you or HURD AUTOMOTIVE to end our relationship for any reason at any time.” The handbook also says, “Neither the employee nor HURD AUTOMOTIVE is bound to continue the', '-2- employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship at any time.” Notably, the handbook instructed employees “to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct” and provided that failure to comply with Hurd’s “standard of business ethics and conduct could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.”', 'Finally, the handbook includes a “Progressive Discipline” section that outlines the manner in which the company will handle unsatisfactory conduct. However, and significantly, this section also cautions that Hurd may make use of that policy “at its discretion.” The disciplinary process described may include any of four steps: “verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, or termination of employment.” It provided that, although normally the steps would be followed in order, in some circumstances, including “extreme situations, termination of employment” may occur “without going through the usual progressive discipline steps.” Bucci acknowledged receipt of the handbook in 2004.', 'When she returned to Hurd Automotive, Bucci’s job responsibilities as the titles and registrations clerk were largely the same as before. She was required to complete and file the registrations and titles in a timely fashion for the vehicles that defendant sold, leased, or purchased. The record indicates that in 2005, defendant hired a new chief financial officer (CFO), a new office manager, and a new human resources director, all of whom either supervised or interacted with plaintiff. Unfortunately, some of the same performance issues that had bedeviled Bucci during her second stint of employment with Hurd began to surface. Although there had been one documented customer complaint about plaintiff’s professionalism soon after she was rehired, indications of Bucci’s unsatisfactory performance began to increase.', '-3-', 'In an affidavit in support of Hurd’s motion for summary judgment, office manager Alison Drake attested that Bucci was confrontational, lost paperwork, or provided incomplete paperwork to the various state motor vehicle departments and also that Drake had received complaints from employees in other departments about Bucci’s “failure to fulfill her job duties in a timely manner.” Another affiant, director of human resources, Connie Mandeville, attested that, on at least three occasions, she had received complaints from the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) about Bucci’s failure to forward proper registrations in a timely manner. CFO Al Martin attested that he had personally observed plaintiff’s poor attitude and that he was aware of customer complaints about delays in registration of vehicles that they had purchased or leased.', 'Also, Martin noticed that the titles and registrations department, over which he exercised oversight, was not as productive as similar departments in other dealerships at which he had been employed over the span of his forty-two-year career in the industry. He attested that, because that department did not generate activity reports outlining the current status of titles and registrations for vehicles sold by defendant, Hurd had difficulty tracking paperwork and responding to questions from customers or state registries. He also attested that, generally, the other titles and registrations departments at dealerships with which he had been associated performed additional duties, such as payroll processing.', 'Martin discussed increasing productivity with Bucci, but he said that he found that she was generally unwilling to perform those responsibilities and that she resisted receiving training on the payroll computer system. By contrast, in Bucci’s deposition testimony, she asserted that Martin had asked her to do billing for wholesale vehicles. This, she said, she was willing to do because she had performed that type of work previously. However, Bucci further testified that her computer was limited to use for', '-4- registrations, and, when it was programmed for the additional workload, a software conflict would crash the registrations program. Therefore, Bucci said, she required a second computer to perform the additional tasks, and she had not received it by the time of her termination. Nonetheless, Martin averred that Bucci failed to perform other tasks, such as generating activity reports, and that she had difficulty completing customers’ registrations and timely filing them with the appropriate state registries. 1', 'It is also significant that, in early 2006, plaintiff experienced certain physical health problems. She began having pain in her left knee to the extent that she required a walker and that made walking up and down stairs difficult for her. Eventually, defendant arranged to move Bucci’s office from the second floor to the first so that she would be relieved of using the stairs. Bucci did not miss any time from work as a result of her knee pain. Also, in the summer of 2006, Bucci underwent cataract surgery, which required her to take medical leave for less than a week.', 'It is undisputed that, on the day before she underwent cataract surgery, Bucci forged two customer signatures to a letter sent to the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles (the department). After she had registered a vehicle for two customers who resided in Connecticut, plaintiff realized that the department had overcharged Hurd more than $900. Bucci learned from the department that the only way to have the overcharged amount refunded to defendant, rather than to the customers, was for the customers to send a letter to the department authorizing the change. Bucci testified at her deposition that, instead of waiting until after her surgery to resolve the issue, she drafted the letter, signed the customers’ names, and faxed it to the department. Several days later, the customers called Hurd to complain that their signatures had been forged. 1', 'Of particular note, plaintiff chose not to depose Martin.', '-5- The customers also contacted the police, although no criminal charges were lodged against Bucci. As a result of this incident, on September 6, 2006, plaintiff’s supervisor, Wendy Bowen, and Mandeville disciplined plaintiff by means of a written warning, which she acknowledged by signing. The warning also instructed plaintiff that she was “never to sign for a customer under [any] circumstances.” Mandeville testified that Martin and Bowen had considered discharging Bucci because of the forgery incident, but, on reflection, they had decided to give her another chance.', 'Approximately two months later, Martin terminated plaintiff’s employment.', 'Martin swore in his affidavit that, before the forgery incident, he had met with plaintiff on two occasions at which he communicated his expectations for her job performance. According to Martin, Bucci’s performance failed to improve after those meetings; she continued to be delinquent in returning customer phone calls, was rude to coworkers, and filed late or incomplete title and registration paperwork. Martin attested that in November 2006, after the forgery incident, he reviewed Bucci’s personnel file for the first time and discovered complaints filed against plaintiff dating from 2001. According to him, it was after this review that Martin discharged plaintiff. He maintained that he based his decision upon his personal observations of plaintiff’s work performance, the forgery incident, his desire to obtain more productivity from the titles and registrations department, and plaintiff’s unwillingness to perform these additional tasks. When she was deposed, Mandeville testified that Bucci had been fired for a variety of reasons, including the forgery and poor work performance before and after the forgery, coupled with the employer’s desire to rearrange positions in an effort to increase productivity.', 'The plaintiff argues in her brief to this Court that Martin could not have reviewed Bucci’s personnel file before he fired her because Mandeville testified when she was deposed that she', '-6- kept all personnel files locked away and Martin did not ask to review Bucci’s file until after she had been dismissed. When plaintiff inquired why Martin asked to review Bucci’s file after her dismissal, Mandeville responded that Martin had “wondered if anyone else had the trouble we had with her.”', 'After she was fired, plaintiff filed for unemployment benefits with the Department of Labor and Training (DLT). In response to a letter from DLT that requested the reason defendant had discharged plaintiff, Hurd filed an employee termination report indicating that Bucci had been let go because the employer was “rearranging people’s jobs.” Mandeville, who signed the report, stated in her deposition testimony that Martin and Bowen decided to not disclose the negative reasons for plaintiff’s discharge because defendant did not “want to make anything hard for [Bucci]” but that it was “too bad she had so many complaints.” Mandeville testified that even though poor work performance is not a disqualifying event for the receipt of unemployment compensation benefits, she filed the report in that manner to ensure that Bucci could collect them.', 'The plaintiff filed charges of discrimination with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (RICHR) on June 9, 2007. 2 After receiving a notice of right to sue from the RICHR on October 19, 2007, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court, alleging violations of FEPA, for discrimination based on age and disability. On February 4, 2011, after both sides had conducted discovery, Hurd filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.', 'After a hearing on April 12, 2011, the trial justice granted Hurd’s motion for summary judgment in its entirety.', 'Employing the burden-shifting, three-step analytical framework 2', 'We thank the RICHR for the amicus curiae brief that it filed in this case.', '-7- outlined in McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), the trial justice assumed that plaintiff had satisfied the first step of this paradigm, the prima facie case, found that defendant had met step two, the burden of producing a legitimate nondiscriminatory purpose for Bucci’s termination, and then concluded that plaintiff had failed to meet her burden of presenting material evidence demonstrating that Hurd’s legitimate reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial justice found that plaintiff “provide[d] no substantive or evidentiary rebuttal” of Hurd’s reasons for termination, including “poor work performance,” “ongoing customer and co-worker complaints, as well as a need to realize more productivity from the title and registration clerk position formerly held by plaintiff.” The plaintiff filed a timely appeal to this Court on April 27, 2011.', 'Before this Court, plaintiff presses arguments for her claims of both age and disability discrimination. In essence, she argues that (1) the trial justice erred in finding that defendant met its burden of producing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiff’s dismissal; and (2) the trial justice erred in holding that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that those reasons were merely pretextual.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v.

In its amicus curiae brief, the RICHR fashions a disability discrimination claim; however, we will not consider arguments that have been made by an amicus curiae but that were not advanced by a party.

In her brief to this Court, Bucci does not appear to present arguments to demonstrate that she had satisfied her burden to establish a prima facie claim. Instead, Bucci relies upon the trial justice’s assumption that Bucci had made a successful prima facie claim without establishing it, and she directs us to the memorandum she filed objecting to defendant’s motion for summary judgment, “[t]o the extent this Court decides to review [the prima facie claim] de novo[.]” 3 Article I, Rule 16(a) of 3', 'Although not material to our discussion here, we do note that plaintiff did not include the objection to summary judgment in her appendix on appeal. Also, it goes without saying that our review of summary judgment is always de novo.', '- 11 - the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure states that “[e]rrors not claimed, questions not raised and points not made ordinarily will be treated as waived and not be considered by the Court.” As discussed above, we generally will consider an issue waived that is not raised by the appellant. Chase, 9 A.3d at 1256.', 'It is also true, however, that the trial justice assumed, without deciding, an element of a claim in a summary judgment proceeding, which we have held is “consistent with the summary judgment standard of viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here, [the] plaintiff.” See Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 305 (R.I. 2013). We consistently have agreed with the United States Supreme Court that a plaintiff’s burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination is “not especially onerous.” See Barros, 710 A.2d at 685; see also St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993) (holding the plaintiff satisfies the burden of a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence); McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280. In Daniels, 64 A.3d at 305, the trial justice assumed an element, and we adopted that approach. Thus, we will give plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and assume without deciding that she has established a prima facie case, thereby satisfying the first step of McDonnell-Douglas. 4 4', 'Unlike in Center for Behavioral Health, Rhode Island, Inc. v. Barros, 710 A.2d 680, 685 (R.I. 1998), defendant raises a challenge to plaintiff’s ability to establish her prima facie case on appeal. The defendant argues that plaintiff failed to meet Hurd’s legitimate expectations because of her poor work performance, forgery, and customer complaints. See also Neri v. Ross-Simons, Inc., 897 A.2d 42, 49 (R.I. 2006). But see Ashley v. Paramount Hotel Group, Inc., 451 F. Supp. 2d 319, 332 (D.R.I. 2006) (determining under FEPA that the plaintiff did not meet the employer’s legitimate expectations because there was unrebutted evidence of the plaintiff’s poor work performance). Several federal circuits have discussed the difficulty inherent in denying a plaintiff’s prima facie claim on the basis of not meeting legitimate expectations because employers articulate the same legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for termination used in step two, which essentially forces the plaintiff to argue pretext at the prima facie stage. See Thomas v. Denny’s, Inc., 111 F.3d 1506, 1510 (10th Cir. 1997); Davenport v. Riverview Gardens School District, 30 F.3d 940, 944 (8th Cir. 1994); Siegel v. Alpha Wire Corp., 894 F.2d 50, 54 (3d Cir. 1990). We need not, and do not, reach the issue here because doing so is not necessary for us to decide this case.', '- 12 -', '2', 'Legitimate Nondiscriminatory Reason', 'Under the McDonnell-Douglas framework, after plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, the burden shifts to defendant to come forward with legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the employee’s termination. Neri, 897 A.2d at 49 (citing Barros, 710 A.2d at 685). The defendant’s burden is one of production, not persuasion. Id. (citing Casey v. Town of Portsmouth, 861 A.2d 1032, 1037 (R.I. 2004)). When a defendant offers such a reason, it “eliminates the presumption of discrimination created by the prima facie case.” Id. (citing Wellborn v. Spurwink/Rhode Island, 873 A.2d 884, 889 (R.I. 2005)). To satisfy this burden of production, a defendant need only offer affidavits supporting the nondiscriminatory reason. Id. at 50.', 'The defendant articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for discharging plaintiff as follows: (1) plaintiff forged customers’ signatures on a letter submitted to a state agency; (2) plaintiff was unable or unwilling to perform additional responsibilities such as generating activity reports and payroll processing through defendant’s computer system; (3) plaintiff struggled to properly and timely complete customers’ registrations with appropriate state departments of motor vehicles; (4) defendant received complaints from customers and coworkers about plaintiff’s poor work performance; (5) following the forgery incident, plaintiff’s work performance did not improve, and she failed to take on additional responsibilities that Martin had requested of her. To support its assertions, defendant presented plaintiff’s admission to the forgery in her deposition testimony, Mandeville’s deposition testimony, documented customer complaints, and affidavits from Martin, who fired Bucci, as well as Hurd’s office manager, Alison Drake, who attested to Bucci’s poor work performance and complaints that she received about Bucci from other Hurd employees.', '- 13 -', 'On appeal, plaintiff sets forth a number of arguments attempting, without success in our opinion, to demonstrate that the trial justice erred when she found defendant failed to meet its burden of production.', 'First, plaintiff contends that defendant is precluded from relying on a reason that was not available to it at the time of the discharge, or that it did not consider at the time the termination was effectuated. In Martin’s 2011 affidavit, he swore that he made the decision to terminate Bucci after he had learned about complaints about her dating back to 2001 and that those complaints had been recorded in Bucci’s personnel file. However, Bucci points out that that assertion stands in stark contrast to Mandeville’s deposition testimony, in which Mandeville testified that no one had examined Bucci’s personnel file until after Martin had discharged her. This, she argues, is mendacious and demonstrates clearly that Hurd’s stated reasons for firing Bucci were merely pretextual. However, we are not persuaded because, even if Martin had not viewed Bucci’s personnel file at any time before he discharged her, Bucci does not dispute the other incidents that are set forth in Martin’s affidavits. 5 In those affidavits, Martin said that he had received complaints from coworkers about plaintiff’s poor work performance and attitude and from customers who had complained about plaintiff. Martin further attested that he met with Bucci on at least two occasions with regard to his expectations of her, but that the meetings failed to result in any significant improvement in her performance because she continued to not return customers’ telephone calls, filed late or incomplete registrations, and declined to be trained on the payroll computer system to assist with payroll processing. 5', 'Martin filed two affidavits, the first in 2007, and the second in 2011. The 2007 affidavit makes no mention of a review of Bucci’s personnel file at any point, but it does refer to ongoing customer complaints about Bucci, her poor attitude, and her poor performance.', '- 14 -', 'Second, Bucci cites to our decision in Casey, 861 A.2d at 1037 n.2, in which we held that any legitimate nondiscriminatory reason must be admissible under the rules of evidence. See also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255 and n.9. Bucci argues that to depend on customer complaints from 2001-02 is to rely upon hearsay upon hearsay because the complaints upon which defendant relied were vague and were from unidentified customers. We do not agree. The record indicates that defendant documented four complaints made against Bucci in 2001-02, three of which state the name of the complainant and specify the reason for the complaint. Moreover, even if we were to agree with Bucci that these complaints were rife with hearsay, Bucci nonetheless fails to dispute the affidavits and testimony of Hurd employees that they had received complaints from customers, motor vehicle departments, and coworkers in 2006, which appear to provide a more legitimate reason for termination than complaints from five years earlier. 6', 'Finally, plaintiff maintains that defendant relied upon evidence that was too vague. Bucci urges that Mandeville could not provide the name of one complainant, or even describe in detail the nature of the complaints. In our opinion, this is not dispositive because Martin, Drake, and Bowen all swore to customer, coworker, and motor vehicle department complaints arising from Bucci’s job performance. Bucci has not challenged these averments on appeal.', 'Because defendant’s burden is limited to one of production, we are convinced that Hurd has provided legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for discharging plaintiff. 6', 'In all likelihood, the complaints from 2001-02 would not constitute hearsay because, as we also discussed in Casey v. Town of Portsmouth, 861 A.2d 1032, 1037 n.2 (R.I. 2004), when considering similar complaints, defendant does not offer the complaints for the truth of the matter asserted, but to serve as the basis for Martin’s state of mind when he decided to terminate plaintiff.

To prove discrimination, a plaintiff need not provide a “smoking gun,” but rather must prove that “[the] defendants’ legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring [her] was merely pretext (which would mean that the real reason for not hiring [the] plaintiff was unlawful animus).” Casey, 861 A.2d at 1038 (citing Barros, 710 A.2d at 685).

However, the plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating not only that the offered reasons are false, but “that discrimination was the real reason.” McGarry, 47 A.3d at 281.', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred when she found that plaintiff had failed in her burden to demonstrate pretext. In that regard, the trial justice found that plaintiff had “fail[ed] to offer any valid rebuttal to the defendant’s alleged legitimate reason for her termination.” The plaintiff, in her efforts to convince us to vacate the judgment, unleashes a', '- 16 - barrage of arguments to demonstrate the trial justice’s error. Because plaintiff offers no direct evidence of a discriminatory reason, she employs the indirect method to undermine defendant’s proffered reasons for discharge.', 'Primarily, Bucci argues that the trial justice erred because there was evidence of falsehood or mendacity. Specifically, Bucci contends that the affidavit of Martin, in which he swore that he fired Bucci after gleaning customer complaints from her personnel file, is an “undisputed lie” because Mandeville, the director of human resources, testified in her deposition that Martin did not even review the file until after Bucci was fired. Also, Bucci claims that Mandeville’s testimony that the DMV had made complaints about Bucci’s job performance was “unworthy of belief” because a DMV employee who had interacted with Bucci attested that he had no recollection of making complaints about Bucci or having any problems with her job performance. As further evidence of pretext, Bucci contends that defendant deviated from its own personnel policies when it fired her. Bucci points out that, aside from the warning notice she received for the forgery incident, she received no other documented incident reports or warning notices, either prior to or after the forgery incident.', 'In this step of a McDonnell-Douglas analysis, we first must consider whether the purportedly legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for termination offered by the employer are tainted by this claimed “suspicion of mendacity.” Neri, 897 A.2d at 50 (quoting Barros, 710 A.2d at 685). In Barros, 710 A.2d at 686, we observed that the employer found the employee’s conduct to be objectionable only after she had announced that she was pregnant. That gave rise to a suspicion of mendacity, which, when combined with the employer’s failure to follow its personnel policies, was deemed to be sufficient to support a finding of unlawful gender discrimination.', 'Id.', 'We have noted that “Barros stands for the proposition that evidence', ""- 17 - suggesting a meaningful ‘suspicion of mendacity’ will greatly bolster a plaintiff's case.” Neri, 897 A.2d at 50. However, and without in any way retreating from our holding in Barros, we also echo the cautions described in Mesnick v. General Electric Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991), that “[c]ourts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits—or even the rationality—of employers’ nondiscriminatory business decisions.” Simply put, an employer may terminate an employee for any reason, good or bad, provided that “the decision to fire does not stem from the person’s age.” Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1341 (1st Cir. 1988)."", 'We simply do not perceive a Barros-like event in the present case. Indeed, it would appear that the event that ultimately would serve as the harbinger for plaintiff’s ultimate discharge was Hurd’s hiring of Martin as CFO in 2005. Martin seemingly had a higher, more stringent standard with which he wanted plaintiff to comply. It is true that there is some inconsistency between the testimony of Mandeville and the affidavit of Martin about the timing of Martin’s review of plaintiff’s personnel file. However, a mere inconsistency, without more, does not give rise to a suspicion of mendacity. Bucci is correct when she argues that the facts should be construed in a light most favorable to her, but we do not agree that this standard demands that we consider the factual dispute as evidence of intentional falsehood. In a de novo review of a grant of summary judgment, we will make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Martin v. Marciano, 871 A.2d 911, 914-15 (R.I. 2005). Because the record contains only the inconsistency between Martin’s affidavit and Mandeville’s deposition testimony and not some other evidence that would suggest that Martin had been untruthful in his affidavit, it would be inappropriate for this Court to conclude that Martin lied. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Bucci, it is certainly reasonable to conclude that Martin never', '- 18 - reviewed plaintiff’s personnel file before he discharged her. However, were we to agree with plaintiff that a party could defeat summary judgment whenever there is some non-material factual dispute, summary judgment would never be appropriate in these cases because the trial court would be required to assume that the moving party had lied, even though there may be other reasonable explanations for the discrepancy. 7', 'Moreover, even assuming that Martin had not reviewed the personnel file before he fired Bucci, the 2001-02 complaints about Bucci’s performance were not the solitary evidence defendant presented to support the termination. Mandeville testified in her deposition that the forgery incident was one of the reasons for firing Bucci. It is also significant that Martin supervised plaintiff’s department for more than a year, received complaints from coworkers about Bucci’s performance, and personally attested to her unwillingness to assume more responsibilities in her capacity as titles and registrations clerk.', 'The plaintiff also provided the affidavit of DMV employee Thomas San Bento to support her pretext argument; she argues that that affidavit demonstrates that Mandeville’s testimony regarding DMV complaints about Bucci is not worthy of belief. It is important to note, however, that San Bento said in his affidavit that he did not recall making any complaints about Bucci and that he found her to be “professional, efficient and competent.” But Mandeville never said that it 7', 'Bucci also contended in her brief, and at oral argument, that the apparent inconsistency between Martin’s affidavit and Mandeville’s deposition testimony was a material factual dispute that should have been resolved by a jury. We disagree. “A ‘genuine’ issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party, and a ‘material fact’ is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.” Calero-Cerezo v. United States Department of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-50 (1986)). This dispute does not have the potential to affect the outcome of the case because plaintiff does not challenge the several other offered reasons for her termination, which were sufficient to overcome a claim of discriminatory animus. Indeed, in her brief submitted to this Court, plaintiff acknowledges that Martin based his decision to fire Bucci on what he found in the file and on his own “observations and assessments of her work performance.”', '- 19 - had been San Bento who had made a complaint to her about Bucci. Indeed, other employees from the DMV, or employees from motor-vehicle departments from other states, may well have complained about Bucci’s performance. When a plaintiff attempts to counter a claim by an employer that it fired an employee for poor performance, it is simply not sufficient for a plaintiff to present evidence that her performance was satisfactory.', 'See Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir. 2010). The plaintiff’s burden is to demonstrate that it was unlawful discrimination that motivated the dismissal, and not simply an employer’s erroneous belief or assessment about poor performance. Id. at 1267.', 'The plaintiff correctly asserts that Hurd did not follow its own employment-termination policies that are set forth in its employee handbook, and she relies upon Barros, 710 A.2d at 686, to support an argument that this too gives rise to a suspicion of mendacity. This argument is unpersuasive, however, because it is undisputed that her employment was designated as “at will” that could be terminated “with or without cause, at any time.” Hurd’s policy of progressive discipline does outline a system of escalating actions to address an employment deficiency, but it also reiterates, at the outset of the description of the policy, that employment is “at will” and that defendant “may use progressive discipline at its discretion.” On the other hand, the handbook in Barros, 710 A.2d at 686, did not grant discretion to the employer when pursuing employment termination. Even if defendant had the benefit of a larger paper trail detailing plaintiff’s alleged performance deficiencies and if, as a result, defendant had made use of the progressive-discipline policy, its failure to do so does not constitute pretext when implementation of the policy is discretionary and plaintiff is an at-will employee. Cf. Morris v. City of Chillicothe, 512 F.3d 1013, 1020 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding failure to follow progressive discipline policy does not constitute pretext when employer reserves right to fire at-will employees without notice);', '- 20 - Timmerman v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 483 F.3d 1106, 1120 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding failure to follow progressive discipline does not demonstrate pretext when use of the policy is entirely discretionary); Fane v. Locke Reynolds, LLP, 480 F.3d 534, 541 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding no pretext for not following progressive discipline where policy contemplated immediate termination for certain offenses).', 'Further, the policy states that there are some employee problems that would in “extreme situations” warrant immediate termination. Presumably, one such extreme situation could stem from an employee’s failure, by engaging in a forgery, to comply with Hurd’s standard of business ethics charging its employees to refrain from any dishonest or unethical conduct. Hurd’s handbook continues that violation of this standard “could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.” It is clear that plaintiff received a warning after the forgery, but defendant argues that the forgery was but a part of the mosaic leading to her termination; it was not the sole grounds for dismissal. Nevertheless, such an incident could surely be taken into consideration at the time the final decision about Bucci’s employment was made. However, it is important to consider that determining whether the employer properly or efficiently made use of its discretionary progressive-discipline policies is not the role for this Court. Rather, our role is to determine if the personnel action was motivated by discrimination due to age. To second-guess discretionary uses of personnel policies for at- will employees when there is a lack of evidence of age discrimination would place this Court in the role of a “super personnel department”; a role we decline to embrace.', 'The plaintiff next argues that there is an inconsistency between Martin’s affidavit, in which he swore that Bucci was unwilling to take on certain additional tasks, and Bucci’s deposition testimony, in which she indicated that she was willing, but computer problems', '- 21 - stymied her ability to do so. On appeal, Bucci claims that, after she informed Martin that she required two computers to begin the payroll processing, Martin promised to provide her with a second computer but then failed to abide by his commitment. However, when we analyze Bucci’s deposition testimony, it is unclear that she actually informed Martin of the need for two computers, and there is no indication that Martin promised or even indicated to Bucci that he would provide her with a second computer. Even if we were to assume that Bucci’s version of events is accurate, she fails to address defendant’s affidavits that stated she was unwilling to receive training on Hurd’s payroll system and that she did not take on the other tasks that Martin requested of her, such as generating activity reports to track the status of pending registrations. 8 8', 'Bucci’s testimony on both of these matter is as follows:', '“Q: Do you recall sitting down with Mr. Martin and him', 'talking to you about some changes he wanted to make with respect', 'to the way you had been doing things?', '“* * *', '“[BUCCI]: In my office I had a computer that was just for', 'the Registry, nothing else. So, he had said that he wanted that', 'office to do more than just registrations. He wanted it to do the', 'billing for the wholesale vehicles. I said to him fine. I’ve done', 'that before, so I can do it again.', '“So, he was going to make arrangements to have the', 'information put into my computer, which was supposed to be only', 'for registrations. So, he had someone come in to program the', 'whole computer for what he wanted done for the dealership.', '“It didn’t work out, because every time I went from the', 'Registry format to the Hurd format, it would kick me out of', 'registrations. So, I ended up calling the Registry every time I got', 'kicked out, and I was told by Mr. Sambento [sic] that that', 'computer should not be used for anything else but registrations.', '“* * * If he wanted me to do something else, he was going', 'to have to get me a new computer just for that so I would have two', 'computers.', '“They were going to be in the process of doing it and all', 'they gave me at the time was the printer for the billing but never', 'set up the computer for it. It was still that way until I left.”', '- 22 -', ""Finally, in an effort to demonstrate pretext, Bucci takes aim at the forms defendant provided to DLT after her discharge, which were silent as to any negative reasons for plaintiff’s termination. She points out that Mandeville, who filled out and filed the report, specified that “we are rearranging people’s jobs” as the reason for termination. The plaintiff contends that this inconsistency demonstrates that the real reason for her firing was her age. This argument also founders because the record reveals that Hurd’s consistent effort to achieve more productivity out of plaintiff’s department was a reason for her termination. Further, Mandeville testified that Hurd often did not list negative reasons for termination out of a concern that doing so might jeopardize the former employee’s ability to collect unemployment. Specifically, Mandeville testified that she did not “want to make anything hard” for Bucci. Cf. Hux v. City of Newport News, Va., 451 F.3d 311, 315 (4th Cir. 2006) (“Once an employer has provided a non- discriminatory explanation for its decision, the plaintiff cannot seek to expose that rationale as pretextual by focusing on minor discrepancies that do not cast doubt on the explanation's validity, or by raising points that are wholly irrelevant to it.”)."", 'Ultimately, after considering the pleadings and affidavits in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, it is our opinion that the plaintiff has been unable to cast any meaningful doubt that the defendant’s proffered reasons for termination were merely a cover-up for age discrimination. Arguably, Hurd did not handle this termination as nimbly as possible, but it is the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate that the true reason for discharge was unlawful discrimination, and she has not done so. Further, we are not persuaded that there are any genuine issues of material fact that would need to be decided by a jury. A reasonable juror could not infer age discrimination based on the presence of minor inconsistencies in testimony and the undisputed evidence of substandard performance. We have carefully considered each of the other arguments raised by', '- 23 - the plaintiff, and we conclude that they are without merit. We hold that the motion justice properly entered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on both employment discrimination claims.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. This case highlights the tension between the summary judgment standard and the substantive framework applied to employment discrimination claims. Although this Court has adopted the three-step McDonnell- Douglas framework in these cases, we did not dispense with the Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a Superior Court justice deny summary judgment when there exists a genuine issue of material fact. Because my de novo review of the record results in a substantially different view of the evidence and because I therefore conclude that genuine issues of material fact concerning Hurd’s motivation for terminating Bucci are manifest, I respectfully dissent. 1 1', 'I concur with the majority’s conclusion that plaintiff’s disability discrimination claim was waived. Although many of the facts supporting an age discrimination claim would also support a disability discrimination claim, plaintiff’s discussion of her medical conditions in her brief states only that “[d]uring CFO Martin’s tenure, Plaintiff began having problems associated with old age.” No such discussion of a disability occurs in the brief. The only mention of any disability whatsoever is Bucci’s averment that she filed a disability claim with the Commission for Human Rights and the allegations in the complaint. With those meager statements, particularly given that there is a question of whether there is any evidence that defendant regarded her as having a disability, the issue was not sufficiently developed for our review.', '- 24 -', 'I', 'Summary Judgment in Employment Discrimination Cases', 'An employment discrimination case is a unique cause of action. Unlike a straightforward tort or breach of contract case—where, on summary judgment, a trial justice can look at one set of elements to a cause of action and determine whether or not there is a genuine issue of material fact relating to one or more of those elements—the McDonnell-Douglas framework is more akin to a moving target with three steps and shifting burdens of proof and production. Thus, I begin my analysis by describing the proper legal context for consideration of a motion for summary judgment in an employment discrimination case.', 'A', 'The Summary Judgment Standard', 'The starting point for any legal analysis by this Court is the standard of review. “[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v.

Potentially false (or perjurious) evidence cannot be overlooked or, worse, ignored on summary judgment. With these principles in mind, it follows that a plaintiff is not required to disprove each and every one of a defendant’s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons when he or she can cast substantial doubt on all of them because there is evidence suggesting mendacity. 2 Ultimately, the question of whether to draw the necessary inferences to establish the 2', 'As the Third Circuit stated when addressing a Title VII claim:', '“We do not hold that, to avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff must cast', 'doubt on each proffered reason in a vacuum.

Accordingly, an employee need only “demonstrate[] that * * * age * * * was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though the practice was also motivated by other factors.” Section 28-5-7.3 (emphasis added).

See Donald and Pardue, 57 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. at 762-63 (advocating for liberal construction of drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and noting that it is, arguably, already the standard). It merely places the substantive framework of an employment discrimination case—as adopted by this Court—in the proper context of a summary judgment motion. Therefore, on the third prong of the McDonnell-Douglas framework, the burden on the plaintiff at the summary judgment stage is merely to put forth evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that, when viewed as a whole, the employer’s decision was motivated at least in part by discrimination. 5 It is in this context, that I proceed to analyze the evidence presented in this case.', 'II', 'Application of the Standard and the Framework to the Facts', 'The majority, quite appropriately, begins its discussion of the third prong of the McDonnell-Douglas framework by addressing Bucci’s argument that there was evidence of mendacity, based primarily on the glaringly inconsistent testimony of Martin and Mandeville. Martin testified by affidavit that, in conjunction with the warning notice given to Bucci for the forgery incident with the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles (the Connecticut incident), “I reviewed Ms. Bucci’s employment file for the first time and found there were many previous complaints against her, dating as far back as August 2001.” Martin then detailed what he learned', 'on society more generally. * * * The General Assembly specifically and solemnly', 'declared that the FEPA was designed to address ‘matter[s] of state concern * * *', '[which] foment[] domestic strife and unrest * * * and undermine the foundations', 'of a free democratic state.’” Weeks v. 735 Putnam Pike Operations, LLC, No.', '2012-356-A., slip op. at 17-18 (R.I., filed Feb. 28, 2014) (quoting G.L. 1956 § 28-', '5-2). 5', 'This formulation does not ignore pretext; viewing the evidence as a whole also includes consideration of the defendant’s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its action.', '- 34 - from the file in three paragraphs. Martin then attested that “[b]ased on my observations and assessment of Ms. Bucci’s work performance and upon my review of her personnel file, Hurd discharged her for the third and final time in November 2006.” 6 Mandeville, however, testified in her deposition that no one looked at Bucci’s file until after she was terminated. 7 Only one of these witnesses was truthful, and it is not for this Court, or the trial justice on summary judgment, to decide which one.', 'The majority errs in its conclusion that this striking dichotomy, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff and drawing all reasonable inferences from this evidence, does not permit a factfinder to infer that there was “a suspicion of mendacity” regarding Hurd’s motivation for firing Bucci. See Barros, 710 A.2d at 685 (noting that the elements of a sufficient prima facie case can “combine with the factfinder’s belief that the basis for dismissing the employee was pretextual, particularly if ‘accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity,’ [thus] the factfinder is 6', 'Additionally, in its response to interrogatories, defendant stated that “[w]hen Hurd began to consider the possibility of firing Plaintiff, Mr. Martin looked into Plaintiff’s file and noticed the previous complaints against Plaintiff.” 7', 'The following colloquy occurred during Mandeville’s deposition:', '“Q. * * * [I]n order to get the [employment] folder, they would', 'have to talk to you right?', '“A.

Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1092 (1st Cir. 1995))). The majority declares—without citation—that “a mere inconsistency, without more, does not give rise to a suspicion of mendacity.” The majority then states that it would be “reasonable to conclude that Martin never reviewed plaintiff’s personnel file before he discharged her,” but that “it would be inappropriate for this Court to conclude that Martin lied.” 8 I agree with the majority that it would be inappropriate for this Court to conclude that Martin lied—that is a question for a factfinder, i.e., a jury. However, a reasonable jury could conclude that Martin’s proffered reliance on a personnel file that he never saw was a post-hoc justification and, therefore, mendacious (and arguably perjurious), which infects the credibility of the entire affidavit. Such issues of credibility are not to be resolved on summary judgment. See DeMaio, 59 A.3d at 130 (“The motion justice ‘must refrain from weighing the evidence or passing upon issues of credibility.’” (quoting Doe v. Gelineau, 732 A.2d 43, 48 (R.I. 1999))). Because my de novo review requires me to draw an inference in favor of plaintiff, as I believe is required under our law on summary judgment, I continue my analysis with the understanding that a suspicion of mendacity pervades Hurd’s purported reasons for terminating Bucci.', 'Although standing alone, the fact that Martin may have lied about examining Bucci’s personnel file may not be sufficient to give rise to an issue of fact as to a motivating factor for age discrimination, I need not reach such an issue in this case because there is a plethora of evidence piled on top of the allegedly mendacious affidavit. 9 First, the very content of the file 8', 'I am not willing to overlook this evidence as merely “inconsistent” testimony. Nor do I believe that a justice of the Superior Court, when confronted with testimony that may be untruthful, should do so either. 9', 'The majority’s orientation toward the evidence at its analogous point of discussion highlights the difference in our analytical viewpoints. After the majority’s discussion of mendacity, it', '- 36 - includes complaints against Bucci from 2001 and 2002. However, it is undisputed that Bucci was rehired after those complaints. The fact that Hurd now employs some of the same reasons to fire Bucci that it overlooked when it rehired her suggests that the proffered reasons for firing her in this case were pretextual.', 'Additionally, Hurd provided numerous inconsistent reasons for terminating Bucci. As noted above, Martin stated that Bucci’s termination was “[b]ased on [his] observations and assessment of Ms. Bucci’s work performance and upon [his] review of her personnel file,” which was locked away. Mandeville, however, wrote on the form submitted to the Department of Labor and Training that the “reason for separation” was that Hurd was “rearranging people’s jobs.” Mandeville testified that she had never been untruthful on the forms submitted to the Department of Labor.', 'This additional inconsistency, especially when combined with a mendacious affidavit, can be evidence of pretext.', 'The majority may be correct to say that Hurd could have fired Bucci because of the Connecticut incident. But Hurd chose not to do so. Instead, Hurd issued a written warning in accordance with its personnel policy—the first and only such written warning issued to Bucci during her third stint of employment at Hurd. Earlier that year, Bucci had begun to experience knee problems, resulting in her wearing a brace.', 'The day after the Connecticut incident continues that “the 2001-02 complaints about Bucci’s performance were not the solitary evidence defendant presented to support the termination.” In my view, this is the wrong orientation; it slices and dices plaintiff’s evidence, which we are supposed to view in the light most favorable to plaintiff and in the context of the entire claim. Additionally, it contravenes the statute, which only requires plaintiff to demonstrate that age “was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though the practice was also motivated by other factors.” Section 28- 5-7.3. On summary judgment, the analysis should continue to search for whether plaintiff has raised an issue of fact as to discrimination, not whether one of defendant’s listed reasons can survive a piecemeal analysis. See Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 407 (R.I. 2013) (“[T]he burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that ‘prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]’” (quoting Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012))).', '- 37 - occurred, Bucci went on a short medical leave for cataract surgery. Knee and cataract problems are associated with age. Bucci received no additional written warnings after the warning for the Connecticut incident, yet Hurd fired her approximately two months later. This written warning and the two month interval until discharge also undercuts defendants’ response to interrogatories which alleged that the Connecticut incident was “the final straw.”', 'Furthermore, Bucci states in her affidavit that she “recall[ed] asking Martin if the reason I was being terminated from Defendants was because of the September warning [for the Connecticut incident]. He said no.” Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, a reasonable jury could infer that Hurd’s proffer of the Connecticut incident as the reason for her termination was pretextual and that a real reason was Bucci’s age. Alternatively, even if the forgery incident was one of the reasons for firing Bucci, she need only “demonstrate[] that * * * age * * * was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though the practice was also motivated by other factors.” Section 28-5-7.3.', 'The majority also dismisses the conflicting evidence regarding Bucci’s alleged unwillingness to take on additional tasks. Martin’s affidavit contends that Bucci was “generally unwilling” to perform additional duties. The plaintiff, however, actually testified that she agreed to at least some of the tasks, 10 but she was unable to do so on her computer because that computer could not be used for anything other than online vehicle registrations. The plaintiff submitted additional evidence from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that corroborated the DMV’s requirement of a dedicated computer for registrations. Bucci went on to say that she would need a second computer to perform the additional tasks, and that “[t]hey were going to be in the process of doing it” before she was fired. Nevertheless, the majority concludes that 10', 'As quoted in footnote 8 of the majority opinion, regarding billing for wholesale vehicles, plaintiff stated, “I said to [Martin] fine. I’ve done that before, so I can do it again.”', '- 38 - Bucci’s deposition testimony did not specifically rebut Martin’s allegations that Bucci was unwilling to receive training on the payroll system and generate activity reports on pending transactions. In so doing, the majority fails to see what is really at stake in the greater context of the case: an employer suggesting that an employee refused additional responsibilities, and an employee contending that she was willing but her employer did not provide her with the necessary resources—in this case, an additional computer. In my view of the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, whether Bucci was “generally unwilling” to take on additional responsibilities or instead was actually unable to perform the duties because of her computer system is a question of fact for a jury.', 'Finally, Hurd did not follow its own termination procedure.', 'In my opinion, the majority’s observation that plaintiff is an at-will employee—terminable with or without cause at any time—is a red herring on this issue. A plaintiff’s employment status is irrelevant because our law prohibits discrimination no matter the employee’s status. See § 28-5-7. As most employees are at-will, the consideration of an employee’s at-will status as a factor weighing against discrimination would render the statute meaningless. Although progressive discipline is discretionary in Hurd’s employee handbook, here, plaintiff presented evidence that Hurd gives warnings because “[u]sually three warnings [and] you’re terminated.” The policy itself states that its purpose is to “administer[] equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct in the workplace.” This evidence suggests that Hurd typically follows its progressive discipline policy, and therefore, in this case, defendant departed from the company norm. Thus, the violation of a permissive policy may contribute to the mosaic of evidence supporting discrimination, particularly when there is evidence that the policy is usually followed and', '- 39 - actually was followed for two months. It is for a jury—not this Court and not the Superior Court—to decide the weight of this evidence.', 'Having assessed the evidence discussed above—the suspicion of mendacity resulting from Martin’s affidavit, the defendant’s inconsistent reasons for termination and evidence of their falsity, and a failure to follow its own employment procedures—and viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and in the context of the entire claim, a reasonable jury could find that age was a motivating factor in Hurd’s decision to fire Bucci. For this reason, it is my opinion that summary judgment should have been denied in this case.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'Our procedural rules seek to balance the scales of justice: summary judgment provides a party with an opportunity to terminate litigation before a costly trial, but only if no material facts are genuinely in dispute. The summary judgment standard takes into account the potential cost of a trial to a party facing weak claims, the opposing party’s right to a jury’s determination of witness credibility, facts, and inferences, and the judiciary’s interest in judicial economy. It is my opinion that the majority’s approach in this case wrongly tips the scales in favor of employers. An employment discrimination plaintiff’s case is strongest when the evidence is viewed as a whole and not parsed into pieces. This results in a tinted view of the evidence that does not comport with the summary judgment standard. When considering the context of the whole claim, the facts and inferences discussed above permit a factfinder to conclude that age was a motivating factor in Hurd’s decision to fire Bucci. I make no conclusions about the factual strength of Bucci’s claim; it is not for this Court—or the Superior Court—to decide, it is a', '- 40 - question for a jury.

We have held that “[n]o one is under a duty to arbitrate unless with clear language he [or she] has agreed to do so,” Providence School Board, 68 A.3d at 509 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, consequently, “a finding that contracting parties have agreed to substitute arbitration for adjudication must rest on clear contract language as evidence of definite intent to do so.” Polytop Corp. v. Chipsco, Inc., 826 A.2d 945, 947 (R.I. 2003). An examination of a collective bargaining agreement “must demonstrate evidence of mutual assent to arbitration.” Id.; see also Blackstone Valley Gas & Electric Co. v. Rhode Island Power Transmission Co., 64 R.I. 204, 223, 12 A.2d 739, 749 (1940) (“The arbitrator derives his jurisdiction from a mutual agreement of the parties to submit the matter to arbitration.”). Accordingly, we must begin our analysis of the arbitrability of plaintiff’s employment discrimination claims by looking directly at the language of the CBA to which plaintiff and defendant were both parties.', 'See State Department of Corrections, 866 A.2d at 1247 (“Arbitration is a creature of the contract between the parties * * * .”); Bush v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 448 A.2d 782, 784 (R.I. 1982) (“[A] party is bound only to arbitrate those issues that he has consented to arbitrate.”).', '-8-', 'At the outset we are confronted with the reality that the CBA at issue in the instant case does', 'contain', 'an', 'anti-discrimination', 'clause', 'in', 'Article', '4', 'which', 'is', 'entitled “NO DISCRIMINATION” and provides as follows:', '“Neither the Employer nor the Union shall discriminate', 'against or in favor of any Employee on account of race, color,', 'creed, national origin, sex, sexual preference, age, mental', 'disability, physical disability, or activity with respect to the', 'Union.”', 'Alleged violations of the just-quoted provision may be grieved as provided in Article 23 of the CBA, which provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“The purpose of this Article is to establish a procedure for', 'the settlement of grievances which involve the interpretation and', 'application of a specific provision of this Agreement. A grievance', 'shall mean a complaint by an Employee that as to him/her the', 'Employer has interpreted and applied this Agreement in violation', 'of a specific provision hereof. All such grievances will be handled', 'as provided in this Article.” Section 4 of Article 24, which addresses arbitration, reads in relevant part as follows:', '“The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction only over disputes', 'arising out of grievances as defined in [Article 23 of the CBA] and', 'he/she shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify in', 'any way any of the terms of this Agreement.” The language in the CBA does not contain any express reference to the rights of an employee under the RICRA and the FEPA, which certainly provides a predicate for a non-frivolous argument that there is no clear indication in the CBA of a mutual agreement to arbitrate such claims.', 'See Providence School Board, 68 A.3d at 509; Polytop Corp., 826 A.2d at 947. However, the CBA does contain language which prohibits discrimination based on “race” or “color,” which would seemingly cover plaintiff’s claims in the instant case. Consequently, the language of the CBA alone is not determinative, and we are left with the following question: What language must be present in a CBA to constitute a waiver by an employee of the right to', '-9- raise employment discrimination claims under Rhode Island law (specifically the RICRA and the FEPA) in a judicial forum?', 'In answering the above question, our application of the doctrine of election of remedies in circumstances similar to the instant case provides some helpful contextual guidance. The doctrine of election of remedies “is one that is grounded in equity and is designed to mitigate unfairness to both parties by preventing double redress for a single wrong.” State Department of Environmental Management v. State Labor Relations Board, 799 A.2d 274, 277 (R.I. 2002). We have held that, when grievance procedures in a CBA have been invoked, the individual or organization pursuing the grievance is “barred from subsequently seeking redress in the Superior Court.” Id.; see Cranston Teachers’ Association v. Cranston School Committee, 423 A.2d 69, 70-71 (R.I. 1980) (holding that, since the teachers’ association seeking to recover back pay withheld during a wage freeze had utilized the grievance process referenced in the CBA, it had elected its remedy and could not bring its claim in Superior Court); see also Rhode Island Employment Security Alliance, Local 401, S.E.I.U., AFL-CIO v.

Rhode Island College, Board of Governors for Higher Education, 742 A.2d 277 (R.I. 1999) is particularly instructive.

See Cipolla, 742 A.2d at 281. In our opinion in Cipolla, we concluded that those two decisions of the United States Supreme Court had “no precedential effect” because the Supreme Court was addressing the rights of employees under federal statutes whereas Cipolla involved an issue “purely of state law.” Id. at 281, 282.

Southern Union Co., 927 A.2d 292, 293 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). As we have remarked in the past, the FEPA and the RICRA “enforce the rights of the public and implement a public policy that the [L]egislature considered to be of major importance.” Folan, 723 A.2d at 291, 292 (internal quotation marks omitted) (reiterating that the public policy underlying the RICRA and the FEPA is a “broad, fundamental public policy which fulfills paramount purposes”).', '- 12 - because they address federal law, we respectfully consider the potentially persuasive value of the Supreme Court’s reasoning therein as we grapple with the question of what language is required in a collective bargaining agreement for an employee who alleges employment discrimination to be deemed to have waived his or her access to the judicial forum for those claims.11', 'In Alexander v.

The collective bargaining agreement at issue stated that “[n]o employee will be discharged, suspended or given a written warning notice except for just cause,” and it “contained a broad arbitration clause covering differences aris[ing] between the Company and the Union as to the meaning and application of the provisions of [the collective bargaining agreement] and any trouble arising in the plant.” Id. at 39-40 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Such an approach strikes us as being eminently sensible, and it is our judgment that a similar principle should be applied in the case at bar. Accordingly, under the facts presented in the instant case, it is our holding that the right to a judicial forum for claims brought specifically under the RICRA or the FEPA can be waived in a collective bargaining agreement if, and only if, that waiver is clear and unmistakable. Such a holding is not inconsistent with our holding in Cipolla, where those anti-discrimination statutes were not implicated.', 'The RICRA and the FEPA reflect the General Assembly’s very explicit determination that those statutes are necessary to militate against “grave injury to public safety, health, and welfare.” Section 28-5-2. The General Assembly has sounded neither an uncertain nor a muted trumpet in this domain; it has clearly manifested an intent of the highest order to extirpate discrimination in employment in view of its deleterious effect on individuals and on society more generally. See Horn v. Southern Union Co., 927 A.2d 292, 293 (R.I. 2007) (stating that the RICRA was enacted to provide “‘broad protection against all forms of discrimination in all phases of employment’”) (quoting Ward v.

The General Assembly specifically and solemnly declared that the FEPA was designed to address “matter[s] of state', '- 17 - concern * * * [which] foment[] domestic strife and unrest * * * and undermine[] the foundations of a free democratic state.” Section 28-5-2; see footnote 10, supra.', 'The CBA at issue in this case does not contain sufficiently precise language indicative of the required clear and unmistakable assent to waive a specific statutory right to a judicial forum that is plaintiff’s by virtue of the RICRA and the FEPA. It is true that the CBA in the instant case does contain a provision stating that “[n]either the Employer nor the Union shall discriminate against or in favor of any Employee on account of race [or] color * * * .” However, the CBA before us, unlike the one at issue in 14 Penn Plaza, does not contain any reference to the RICRA or the FEPA. Thus, it specifically states that only disagreements regarding the misapplication of the CBA will be grieved and arbitrated. Contrary to defendant’s arguments, such a general arbitration provision simply is not sufficient to clearly and unmistakably waive an employee’s rights under the RICRA or the FEPA. See Manning, 725 F.3d at 52 (stating that “a broadly-worded arbitration clause such as one covering any dispute concerning or arising out of the terms and/or conditions of [the CBA] * * * will not suffice; rather, something closer to specific enumeration of the statutory claims to be arbitrated is required”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Ibarra v.

However, the decision in Jensen is not controlling, nor do we find its reasoning to be persuasive. 19', 'The plaintiff also contends that the CBA at issue in the instant case does not give her the right to pursue a claim for arbitration but instead leaves that right in the hands of the union; plaintiff posits that, in situations like the one before us, when a union “fail[s] to act within the [CBA] [it] acts as a bar to forcing [an] individual to adhere to the terms of the CBA.” We need not, and therefore do not, address this argument given our holding that the language of the CBA was not sufficient to waive plaintiff’s right to access to a judicial forum.

He does not dispute that he is under an obligation to keep the peace and be of good behavior for the full length of his sentence. Rose instead asserts that his full sentence expired earlier than March 13, 2014 because the credits that he received for time served and good time 6 accelerated the start date, and consequently, the end date of his probationary period. Although he initially made a similar argument about his grant of parole, he conceded at oral argument that his release on parole did not have any effect on the end date of his probationary period.

Rev. 195, 195, 200 (2012) (noting that “[a]t least twenty-nine states and the federal government currently offer prison inmates early release, sometimes by many years, in return for good behavior”). Good-time credit serves two primary purposes: it incentivizes orderly behavior while incarcerated. In addition, since good-time credit “results in early release for many inmates[, it] reduces prison overcrowding.” Neil P.

These two (2) days a month shall', 'be deducted regardless of the length of the sentence of the', 'prisoner.” The first clause of § 42-56-24(a) clearly limits that provision’s applicability to situations where a defendant is “sentenced to imprisonment for six (6) months or more” but not “sentenced to imprisonment for life.” (Emphases added.) That section then goes on to state that a defendant’s good-time credits “shall * * * be deducted from the term or terms of sentence.” Id. (emphasis added). “The same words used twice in the same act are presumed to have the same meaning.” 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 46:6 at 249 (7th ed. 2007). The natural conclusion is that the “sentence” from which the Legislature intended the credits to be deducted is one of imprisonment. 9 Thus, the plain language of § 42-56-24 suggests that the only form of mitigation contemplated in that provision is a reduction of the amount of time that a defendant must spend incarcerated.', 'Rose acknowledges that his good-time credits reduced the amount of time that he spent in prison but argues that those credits entitle him to further mitigation of his sentence. In particular, 9', 'In 2012, the Legislature amended G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24(a) to provide that prisoners convicted of certain enumerated offenses “shall not be eligible to earn time off their term or terms of incarceration for good behavior.” See P.L. 2012, ch. 150, § 1 (emphasis added). This recent amendment suggests that our interpretation is consistent with the 2012 General Assembly’s understanding of § 42-56-24(a).', '-7- he argues that, because his good-time credits resulted in his early release from the ACI, his twelve-year period of probation should have commenced and, consequently, ended that much sooner. In making this argument, he relies on the sentencing justice’s pronouncement that his twelve-year term of probation would commence “upon release” from the ACI.', 'A Superior Court sentencing justice has the authority under G.L. 1956 § 12-19-8 to mitigate a defendant’s sentence by “suspend[ing] the execution of the sentence, in whole or in part.” When the sentencing justice orders that the execution of a defendant’s sentence be suspended, “[t]he suspension shall place the defendant on probation[.]” Id. The sentencing justice may determine the length of time and the conditions of that probationary period. Although we have previously interpreted § 12-19-8 as affording a trial justice the discretion to determine when a prisoner’s term of probation will commence, see Gonsalves v. Howard, 113 R.I. 544, 546, 324 A.2d 338, 340 (1974), we have also held that a sentencing justice’s pronouncement about the commencement of probation will not be given effect to the extent that it conflicts with another statutory provision. See State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 339, 342 (R.I. 1997) (citing Gonsalves, 113 R.I. at 547, 324 A.2d at 340-41, but refusing to give effect to trial justice’s statement that probation would commence upon release when to do so would conflict with § 12-19-9).', 'In the instant case, if the sentencing justice’s statement about the commencement of probation is given literal effect, Rose will complete his entire sentence in less than twenty years. At the time Rose was sentenced in 1994, the Legislature had mandated a twenty-year minimum sentence for those convicted of first-degree child molestation. See § 11-37-8.2, as enacted by P.L. 1984, ch. 59, § 2. For sexual offenses, our Legislature has prescribed specific penalties that take into consideration the age of the victims. See State v. Yanez, 716 A.2d 759, 764 (R.I.', '-8- 1998). The minimum sentence provided in § 11-37-8.2 for first-degree child molestation reflects the tender age of the victim. See Yanez, 716 A.2d at 764. Legislatively imposed minima and maxima circumscribe a trial justice’s sentencing authority. See State v. Holmes, 108 R.I. 579, 584, 277 A.2d 914, 917 (1971). In accordance with this principle, we have previously refused to construe a sentencing provision, even an ameliorative one, in a manner that would “authoriz[e] sentencing justices to impose a sentence less than that for which the Legislature ha[s] otherwise specifically provided.” Id. Thus, we conclude that there is no authority which would allow the sentencing justice’s words to effectively reduce the total length of Rose’s sentence below the mandatory minimum. 10', 'The rule of lenity does not compel a different conclusion.', 'Rose suggested at oral argument that, to the extent there is any inconsistency between the statutory minimum sentence and the provisions for good time, the rule of lenity requires that the inconsistency be resolved in his favor. The rule of lenity applies when interpreting statutes that define “the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions” and impose penalties. Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). The award of good-time credits involves “neither the substantive ambit of a criminal prohibition nor the penalty it impose[s].” Sash v. Zenk, 428 F.3d 132, 134 (2d Cir. 2005). As then-Court of Appeals Judge, now United States Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor explained 10', 'Rose suggests that, because G.L. 1956 § 12-19-8 allows for the suspension of his sentence, the twenty-year minimum provided for in G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2 represents only his “potential” sentence of incarceration. The Legislature has expressly indicated when the sentence for a particular offense may not be suspended. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5(c)(2); G.L. 1956 § 31- 40-8(a). The Legislature has not imposed any such restriction on a trial justice’s authority to suspend a sentence for first-degree child molestation. We therefore agree that § 11-37-8.2 does not require that Rose spend twenty years incarcerated at the ACI since § 12-19-8 clearly authorized the sentencing justice to suspend all or part of that twenty-year sentence. In this case, however, the combined length of time that Rose will spend incarcerated and on probation will fall below twenty years if the sentencing justice’s words “upon release” are allowed to control. For this result, we find no authority.', '-9- when writing for the Second Circuit, “[t]he fact that the * * * administrative reward for compliance with prison regulations is a sentence reduction does not make that administrative reward part of the process of criminal sentencing.” Id. We find this reasoning persuasive and agree with those courts which have declined to apply the rule of lenity to statutes awarding good time. See, e.g., Wright v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 451 F.3d 1231, 1236 (10th Cir. 2006); Zenk, 428 F.3d at 134; Perez-Olivo v. Chavez, 394 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 2005) (Bureau of Prisons’ “calculation of reductions in a sentence for [good time], * * * is not, strictly speaking, a ‘criminal’ statute, and thus we do not believe the rule of lenity would apply.”).', 'In contrast, the mandatory minimum contained in § 11-37-8.2 clearly imposes a criminal penalty. We are nonetheless equally unable to apply the rule of lenity to this provision. Resort to the rule of lenity is only appropriate when the meaning of a criminal statute is ambiguous and therefore inappropriate “‘when the legislative intent is clear.’” Such v. State, 950 A.2d 1150, 1158 (R.I. 2008). In § 11-37-8.2, our Legislature clearly and directly stated that the penalty for first-degree child molestation was to be no less than twenty years.', 'The dissent makes a similar argument that, in absence of a clear legislative prohibition, § 42-56-24 should be construed in Rose’s favor. While there may be some intuitive appeal to the idea that silence should be interpreted in applicant’s favor, we respectfully conclude that this argument overlooks the fact that a sentence may be composed of several parts. The dissent reads § 42-56-24, which is silent on probation, 11 as affording the DOC the authority to reduce the 11', 'Our Legislature’s silence about the commencement of probation in a split sentence may be contrasted with the pronouncements of the legislatures in several of our sister states. See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 53a-31(a) (West 2012) (specifying that when probation “is preceded by a sentence of imprisonment with execution suspended after a period of imprisonment set by the court, it commences on the day the defendant is released from such imprisonment”); Fla. Stat. Ann. § 948.012(1) (West 2010) (when the court imposes a “split sentence” of incarceration followed by probation, “[t]he period of probation or community control shall commence', '- 10 - overall length of the split sentence imposed by the trial justice. Here, the trial justice sentenced Rose to a total of twenty years. While the Legislature in § 42-56-24 clearly gave the DOC the discretion to mitigate that sentence by providing for Rose’s early release from the ACI, it did not endow the DOC with the power to modify the overall length of a judicially imposed sentence in the manner that the dissent suggests. Indeed, we doubt whether the General Assembly could lawfully direct the DOC to make such a reduction. While the executive branch may execute a sentence, the power to reduce the length of a sentence imposed by a justice of the Superior Court is a judicial one. See Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. As a judicial power, it may not be exercised by the Legislature, either directly or indirectly. See Taylor v. Place, 4 R.I. 324 (1856).', 'Lastly, we remain unconvinced by Rose’s suggestion that the refusal to reduce his sentence below twenty years unlawfully converts his good-time credits into “additional” probation.', 'We cannot accept Rose’s characterization of his release on good time as the imposition of an added burden. We have consistently explained that “the terms and conditions inherent in the * * * privilege of probation * * * come into existence at the very moment that a sentence that includes probation is imposed,” even before the formal commencement of probation. Dantzler, 690 A.2d at 339 (citing State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193, 195 (R.I. 1989)). immediately upon the release of the defendant from incarceration, whether by parole or gain- time allowances”); Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. § 6-225(b)(2) (LexisNexis 2008) (“If a sentence of imprisonment is imposed and a part of it is suspended with the defendant placed on probation, the court may impose as a condition of probation that the probation begin on the day the defendant is released from imprisonment.”). Similarly, in the federal system, which has a system of “supervised release,” Congress has directed that “the terms of supervised release commence on the day the person is released from imprisonment * * *.” 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e). At least one federal court has relied on this language to hold that good-time credits which accelerate a federal prisoner’s release from incarceration also accelerate the end date of his period of supervised release. See United States v. Lynch, 114 F.3d 61 (5th Cir. 1997). Our Legislature has issued no such directive.', '- 11 - Those implied conditions to keep the peace and be of good behavior therefore apply while a defendant is in the ACI, such that his or her probation may be revoked for a violation of those conditions which occurs before the start of his formal probationary period. See id. at 342. Accordingly, even without any good-time credits, Rose would have been obligated to keep the peace and be of good behavior, or else risk being violated, for the full eight years preceding the formal commencement of his probation. Through legislative grace, Rose spent one and one-half of those eight years on the street rather than in the ACI. The fact that he was still obligated to abide by the same conditions to keep the peace and be of good behavior for that period of time presents no “additional” hardship. Regardless of whether the strings attached are implied or formal, we view the fact that Rose was allowed to spend those eighteen months outside the walls of the ACI as an act of leniency and not as the imposition of an additional burden.', 'B', 'Credit for Time Served Under § 12-19-2(a)', 'We next turn our attention to Rose’s contention that the trial justice erred in failing to advance the end date of his probationary term by an amount of time equal to that which he spent confined while awaiting disposition of his case. Rose argues that he was entitled to such an adjustment under the so-called “dead time” provisions of § 12-19-2(a) which state:', '“(a) Whenever it is provided that any offense shall be punished by', '* * * imprisonment, the court imposing punishment may, in its', 'discretion, select the * * * term within the limits prescribed by law;', 'provided if the punishment to be imposed is imprisonment, the', 'sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of', 'days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting', 'sentencing * * *.” The phrase “dead time” refers to the period of time spent in jail that ordinarily cannot be used to determine a prisoner’s eligibility for parole. State v. Winston, 105 R.I. 447, 454, 252 A.2d 354,', '- 12 - 358 (1969).', 'As we have previously explained, § 12-19-2 represents the Legislature’s “benevolent effort to assist the person who, because of an inability to make bail, [has] been cast into a sort of limbo” where his or her “time spent awaiting trial or sentence [can]not be credited towards any future parole.” State v. Ilacqua, 765 A.2d 822, 824 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Skirvin, 113 R.I. 443, 446, 446 n.1, 322 A.2d 297, 299-300, 300 n.1 (1974)). The credit provided for in § 12-19-2(a) thereby ensures that “all persons sentenced to identical terms w[ill], apart from differentials arising out of allowances for ‘good time’ and/or parole, be deprived of their liberty for identical periods of time.” Holmes, 108 R.I. at 584, 277 A.2d at 917.', 'Consonant with these legislative purposes, we have interpreted § 12-19-2(a) as entitling a defendant to credit towards a term of imprisonment but not to any adjustment of a probationary sentence. See State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1159 n.1 (R.I. 2005) (mem.). In Bergevine, we specifically addressed whether § 12-19-2(a) authorizes a trial justice to advance the calendar dates of a defendant’s sentence to account for the time that the defendant spent in pretrial confinement. On April 25, 1994, Bergevine received a ten-year suspended sentence with ten years probation. See Bergevine, 883 A.2d at 1158. Less than six months after the imposition of his sentence, he violated the terms of his probation and was ordered to serve five of the ten years. See id. He received credit, however, for approximately nine months that he had spent in community confinement while awaiting trial. See id. On January 7, 2004, Bergevine once again violated his probation. See id. He argued that he was no longer on probation at the time of the second alleged violation because the credit he received for time served made his ten-year sentence, including his probation, retroactive. See id. We decisively rejected Bergevine’s argument, reasoning that § 12-19-2(a) did not make his probationary sentence retroactive but', '- 13 - “merely reduced the amount of time that the defendant had remaining to serve on the five-year term of incarceration * * *.” Bergevine, 883 A.2d at 1159.', 'In acknowledgement of Bergevine’s holding, Rose refrains from requesting that we “retro-date” his sentence.', 'He argues nonetheless that his probationary period should have commenced and ended fifteen months earlier because his credit for time served caused him to be released from prison that much sooner. While Rose may intellectualize the situation differently than the defendant in Bergevine, the practical result that he seeks is the same. If we accept Rose’s argument, his entire twenty-year sentence would effectively slide backwards such that both his term of incarceration and his period of probation would begin and end fifteen months earlier. We cannot countenance a result that we have previously forbidden simply because it is painted in different terms. Rose acknowledges that, in accordance with § 12-19-2(a), his term of imprisonment was shortened by the amount of time that he spent awaiting disposition of his case. We do not believe that § 12-19-2(a) entitles him to any further reduction of his sentence.', 'Accordingly, we reach the same conclusion as the hearing justice that neither Rose’s credits for good time nor his credits for time served entitled him to an acceleration of the end date of his probationary term. Although our conclusion rests on reasons that differ from those relied upon by the hearing justice, we may affirm a trial justice’s decision so long as “there are other valid reasons to support the order or judgment appealed from.” DeSimone Electric, Inc. v. CMG, Inc., 901 A.2d 613, 620-21 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Levine v. Bess Eaton Donut Flour Co., 705 A.2d 980, 984 (R.I. 1998)).

The papers in this case may be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Flaherty with whom Justice Robinson joins, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion in this case. In my view, the entirety of the defendant’s twenty-year sentence has been administratively reduced by “Good-Time” credits as provided by G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24 and by credit for time served awaiting disposition pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19- 2(a). Thus, he has fulfilled all of the terms of his sentence: the periods of incarceration and probation. It is my further opinion that the good-time credits and credit for time served should be applied to the entirety of Rose’s sentence and not just the term of incarceration. Therefore, it is my conclusion that the majority effectively, but without citing any statutory authority to do so, has extended Rose’s probation.', '“Good-Time” Credits', 'This Court has not discussed previously the interplay between mandatory minimum sentencing and administrative deductions, such as good-time credits, and to me, the majority appears to be overly focused on the implausibility of a deduction if that results in a sentence that falls below the terms called for by a statutory minimum. The effect of the majority’s opinion is', '- 15 - two-fold. First, the majority, in effect, engrafts a new section onto the statute, restricting the application of good-time credits should those credits result in a sentence that falls below a mandatory minimum. Second, the majority, by necessary implication, would extend probation beyond that imposed by the sentencing justice.', 'I agree with the majority that § 42-56-24 is clear and unambiguous; therefore, “this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v.

State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005). Although the majority correctly construes the statute as a legislatively-crafted means for the Department of Corrections (DOC) to reward good behavior and industriousness, it is my opinion that the majority is in error by concluding that the only “‘sentence’ from which the Legislature intended the credits to be deducted is one of imprisonment.”', 'When we are called upon to resolve an inconsistency between two statutes that are in pari materia, “we construe them in a manner that attempts to harmonize them and that is consistent with their general objective scope.” State v.

I conclude that the most effective way to harmonize the apparent inconsistency between the application of good-time credits under § 42-56-24 and the mandate of the twenty-year statutory minimum pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2 would be to apply earned good-time credits even if', '- 16 - that application would result in a sentence that falls below a statutory minimum. This approach acknowledges the obligation of a trial justice to impose a statutory minimum sentence while nonetheless recognizing that administrative deductions that are provided for by statute can result in a defendant actually serving fewer years than the sentence initially imposed, as long as he has earned good-time credits. 12', 'There is no argument that good-time credits impact directly the period of incarceration, but the thrust of Rose’s appeal surrounds the effect that the statutory deduction should have on the entirety of his sentence. The majority reasons that any deduction applies solely to the period of confinement, but, in my opinion, that interpretation is not consistent with the language of the statute. The statute, as it read in 1994, provided that a specified period of time shall “be deducted from the term or terms of sentence of that prisoner * * * .” 13 Random House defines “deduct” as “to take away, as from a sum or amount.” Random House Unabridged Dictionary 520 (2d ed. 1993). Giving effect to every word of the statute, “the term or terms of sentence” should be read to equally include sentences with a term of twenty years with twenty years to serve, and those with multiple terms, as in this case, a twenty-year sentence with eight years to serve and twelve years suspended, with twelve years’ probation. Moreover, at the time that Rose was sentenced, the Legislature limited the applicability of § 42-56-24 only to those persons imprisoned for “six (6) months or more” but not “sentenced to imprisonment for life.” On its 12', 'Even though this case involved an offense carrying a statutory minimum, I would apply this same approach to sentencing in general. 13', 'The defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere on March 14, 1994.', '- 17 - face, there is nothing in the statute that was in effect in 1994 that would limit the deduction of good-time credits from the whole of Rose’s sentence. 14', 'The majority arrives at its construction of legislative intent using logical inferences in two ways. First, it seems to me that the majority focuses on the word “sentence” and equates “sentence” with “imprisonment” to support its interpretation. Second, the majority points out that the General Assembly amended § 42-56-24 in 2012 to limit its application, by stating that certain offenses “shall not be eligible to earn time off their term or terms of incarceration for good behavior.” See P.L. 2012, ch. 150, § 1. However, it is significant that the General Assembly did not amend the language of § 42-56-24(a). The language in that section is the same today as it was in 1994, and it still retains the phrase “term or terms of sentence.” In my view, nothing cited to by the majority contravenes my conclusion that good-time credits reduce the entirety of sentence and not simply the period of incarceration.', 'In addition, I agree with the majority that the trial justice did not have the authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum and that his declaration at sentencing that probation would commence “upon release” could not have the effect of reducing Rose’s sentence below twenty years. However, and significantly, the deduction in sentence emanated not from the trial justice, but from the General Assembly, when it enacted § 42-56-24. 15 When that statute 14', 'The majority contends that the dissent seeks to construe G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24 in Rose’s favor. I respectfully disagree. I am merely saying that I agree with Rose’s argument that we should adhere to our jurisprudence with respect to statutory construction. 15', 'The majority seems to suggest that there is a separation of powers or constitutional argument as to whether the General Assembly could direct the DOC to make reductions in sentence or whether the Executive Branch, even though cloaked with statutory authority, has the constitutional power to reduce the length of sentence. These arguments have not been a part of this case at any stage and were neither briefed nor argued by the parties. They should not now be introduced as mere dicta. Indeed, consideration of constitutional or separation of powers issues is utterly unnecessary in view of the fact that the majority decided this appeal by following traditional rules of statutory construction. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34,', '- 18 - was passed, the Legislature chose not to include a provision making good-time credits inapplicable should the result be a sentence less than a mandatory minimum. We generally presume that the Legislature knows what it is doing when it enacts statutes. See Brennan v. Kirby, 529 A.2d 633, 637-38 (R.I. 1987). At the time of Rose’s conviction, the only people who were ineligible for good-time credits were those imprisoned for less than six months and those sentenced to life; there is no mention of mandatory minima. Indeed, when the General Assembly later amended § 42-56-24 to make certain offenses ineligible for good-time credits, it could have then made a blanket statement about the inapplicability of the good-time statute to offenses carrying a mandatory minimum, but it chose not to do so. 16', 'Similar statutes in other jurisdictions expressly limit good-time credits in this way. In Delaware, certain statutes specifically provide that felons convicted for a crime carrying a statutory minimum sentence are not eligible for good-time credits. Woodward v. Department of Corrections, 415 A.2d 782, 783 (Del. Super. Ct. 1980) (“[T]he Legislature has also provided that specific minimum sentences for certain types of convicted felons are mandatory and shall not be subject to suspension and no person shall be eligible for probation or parole during such portion of such minimum term.”), aff’d sub nom., Woodward v. State, 416 A.2d 1225 (Del. 1980). In Nebraska, the Supreme Court has held that the Legislature specifically intended to exclude those convicted under a mandatory minimum sentence from the good-behavior statute because the Legislature amended the law after a previous iteration of the statute allowed an offender to be 41 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (discussing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”). 16', 'In 2012, the General Assembly, for the first time, excluded certain offenses from eligibility for good-time credits. See P.L. 2012, ch. 152, § 1 (“(a) A person serving a sentence of a violation of [G.L. 1956 §§] 11-5-1 (where the specified felony is murder), 11-23-1, 11-26-1.4, 11-37-2, 11- 37-8.1 or 11-37-8.3 shall not be eligible to earn time off their term or terms of incarceration for good behavior”).', '- 19 - discharged prior to serving the minimum sentence specified by statute. Johnson v. Kenney, 654 N.W.2d 191, 194-95 (Neb. 2002). On the other hand, in Minnesota, where there is no such prohibition, the Supreme Court concluded that a statutory minimum sentence of twenty-five years could be reduced by that state’s good-behavior statute. State v. Walker, 235 N.W.2d 810, 814 (Minn. 1975).', 'It is also my view that a fair reading of the majority opinion would result in the elimination of the application of good-time credits for defendants serving a mandatory minimum period of incarceration where a period of suspended sentence and a period of probation are not present. For example, a defendant serving a three-year statutory minimum with three years to serve for a third driving-under-the-influence offense under G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2(d)(3)(ii) would have been eligible for good-time credits under § 42-56-24. However, the majority’s opinion could well eliminate good-time credits for this offender because the length of his sentence, after application of earned good-time credits, would fall below the prescribed minimum of three years. The General Assembly did not make that offense ineligible, but this Court appears poised to judicially amend the statute to do just that.', 'Indeed, the majority appears to reason that the application of good-time credits, under any scenario, even when there is no statutory minimum, could reduce only the period of incarceration because neither the General Assembly nor the Executive Branch has the authority to reduce the entire length of a judicially-imposed sentence. If administrative actions cannot modify the overall length of the sentence, taken to its logical conclusion, a defendant serving a five-year sentence without a probationary period would now incur a period of probation because he earned good-time credits.', 'Whereas previously, this defendant would have “flattened,” meaning he would have fulfilled all the obligations of his sentence, under the majority’s', '- 20 - reasoning, he would now be required to serve a period of probation equal to each day of good- time credits earned. 17', 'Finally, the majority does not sufficiently address the thorny issue of explaining defendant’s status after good-time and time-served credits were applied and after he completed his parole, but before his probation began. When his parole ended in January 1999, Rose began serving his probation, which is now entering its sixteenth year, even though a twelve-year period of probation was imposed when he was sentenced. The majority provides no answer to this conundrum and essentially sanctions an extension of Rose’s probation without legislative foundation. 18 In my opinion, the majority attempts to wriggle out of this maze by stating that the imposition of additional terms of probation is not an “added burden” because Rose could have spent that time incarcerated. The majority reasons that probation is better than prison, so there should be no complaint. 19 To support this position, the majority cites two cases that are readily distinguishable from the issues raised in this appeal.', 'First, the majority cites State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 339 (R.I. 1997), to support the proposition that Rose would still be under an implied condition of good behavior for the eighteen 17', 'To be fair, the majority is careful not to denominate the additional burden placed on Rose as probation, but it is difficult to see any other outcome. In State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 339 (R.I. 1997), this Court held that those sentences with probationary periods have an accompanying implied condition of good behavior throughout the term of the sentence, which would seem to indicate that the additional burden imposed on our hypothetical defendant could be fairly described only as a period of probation, or perhaps parole. Unfortunately, this approach appears to create more questions than it addresses and also seemingly judicially amends § 42-56- 24 to include a new administrative burden on the DOC. 18', 'Indeed, at oral argument, the state conceded that Rose was “effectively on probation” before the end of his original eight-year period of incarceration. 19', 'The majority seems to ignore the fact that, unless he violated his probation, there was no option to continue to incarcerate defendant under the statutory scheme for good-time credits. See § 42-56-24. Once good-time credits were earned, the DOC was obligated under the statute to apply them and release defendant. “Legislative grace” may have created these credits, but the majority’s view on defendant’s argument that he has received extended probation is not persuasive.', '- 21 - months of good-time credits he received. In Dantzler, the defendant had escaped from prison and committed a sexual assault while at large. Id. at 339. Dantzler argued that he could not be violated because, due to the fact that he was serving a sentence of incarceration, he was not yet on probation when he committed the sexual assault. Id. But Dantzler is inapposite because Dantzler was not arguing that his probation had terminated but, quite the contrary, that it had not yet commenced. Id. Also, the defendant in Dantzler had not earned any good-time or time- served credits that could have reduced his sentence. Rose, however, did earn those credits, and he has already served the required twelve years of probation. Well beyond the terms of his sentence, defendant has been serving his probation for the past fifteen years. The implied condition of good behavior may be ever present for the entirety of the sentence, but the very purpose of good-time credits is to reduce the duration of the entire sentence.', 'The majority also cites to Lee v. Kindelan, 80 R.I. 212, 95 A.2d 51 (1953), which is equally unpersuasive because in Lee, the Court considered the interplay of good-time credits and parole and held that reductions in sentence were not automatic. Id. at 222, 95 A.2d at 55-56. Lee argued that the applicable “Good Time Law” automatically reduced her sentence; however, this Court held that because Lee had not provided evidence that she had, in fact, earned the credits, she was not entitled to them. Id. at 221-22, 95 A.2d at 55. The Court indicated that the “Good Time Law” in Lee would have reduced the period of incarceration, but only to allow a defendant to begin parole, which was a conditional grant of liberty and not a reduction in the sentence. Id. at 222, 95 A.2d at 56. Not only did the defendant in Lee fail to demonstrate that she had earned any good-time credits, but she was seeking good-time credits so that she could be placed on parole, not probation. Id. at 215-16, 95 A.2d at 52-53; see Curtis, 996 A.2d at 605 (discussing that a parolee is at liberty while on parole “during the remainder of his or her term of', '- 22 - sentence upon any [reasonable] terms and conditions”). This case bears little resemblance to Lee because Rose did earn good-time credits, which, in my opinion, should have been applied to the entirety of the sentence.', 'The majority’s reasoning would seem to support the notion that Rose would have eighteen months remaining under the implied condition of good behavior without the administrative requirements of probation. 20 As if anticipating this inconsistency, the majority states that “[r]egardless of the strings attached,” Rose was not burdened, no matter what his status was upon the completion of his parole. This declaration ignores our existing holdings on extensions of probation. We previously have held that the state and the defendant may not enter into an agreement to extend the defendant’s period of probation beyond that period imposed by the sentencing justice. State v. Traudt, 679 A.2d 330, 331 (R.I. 1996). We have also held that a trial justice is not cloaked with the authority to extend a defendant’s period of probation because the statute does not grant this specific power. State v. Rice, 727 A.2d 1229, 1231 (R.I. 1999). Further, we have stated that the trial justice does not possess the statutory power to amend a sentence and that he is “bound by the terms of that sentence.” Id. The majority now appears to hold that this Court may extend a defendant’s probation.', 'However, the majority cites no 20', 'According to the DOC’s website those persons on probation must satisfy the following requirements:', '“Probationers are supervised by a DOC Probation & Parole', 'Officer. * * * Everybody on probation must follow the general', 'conditions of probation, including reporting to the [probation', 'officer] as required; not breaking any laws; not traveling or moving', 'out of Rhode Island without advance approval; advising the', '[probation officer] of any change of address immediately; and so', 'on.” Department of Corrections, Probation and Parole FAQ', '<http://www.doc.ri.gov/probation/faq.php> (last visited Feb. 7,', '2014).', '- 23 - authority, judicial or legislative, to support its position that defendant’s period of probation may be extended beyond the twelve-year period fixed by the trial justice.', 'In my opinion, this Court also lacks the statutory authority to extend probation. The common application of the word “deduct” from § 42-56-24 would resolve this apparent paradox and provide the most just result for defendant. Deducting the good-time credits from the entirety of Rose’s sentence, just as the General Assembly has mandated, would remove eighteen months from the twenty-year sentence and not result in an unanticipated extension of probation. If, as discussed below, defendant’s entire sentence is further reduced by credits for time served, Rose will have served exactly the sentence that the intersecting statutes intended for him to serve: both the period of incarceration and the period of probation imposed by the trial justice.', 'Credit for Time Served', 'I also depart from the majority’s calculation of credit for time served under § 12-19-2. The Court’s holding today counters our previous pronouncements about the purpose of the statute regarding credit for time served, which was meant to result in equal time for an equal sentence to balance out the situation of the person who can make bail and the person who cannot. As cited by the majority, the statute rectifies this inequity by ensuring that “all persons sentenced to identical terms [will] * * * be deprived of their liberty for identical periods of time.” See State v. Holmes, 108 R.I. 579, 584, 277 A.2d 914, 917 (1971). In Holmes, 108 R.I. at 584, 277 A.2d at 917, we discussed the consequences of administrative reductions that result when credit for time served conflicts with judicial sentencing authority. In Holmes, the Court used the example of defendants A and B who both received a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, but defendant A had served already one year in pretrial confinement. Id. at 583, 277 A.2d at 916. The Court concluded that the trial justice would be required to sentence each defendant to at least', '- 24 - five years, but that the DOC would have the authority to release defendant A one year earlier pursuant to § 12-19-2.', 'Holmes, 108 R.I. at 585, 277 A.2d at 917.', 'Therefore, the Court concluded, the application of the statute resulted in a sentence below the statutory minimum, but that this reduction was administrative, not judicial. Id.', 'The majority notes that we have not previously allowed any adjustment of a probationary period when credit for time served is applied, and, in so reasoning, it relies almost exclusively upon an order of this Court, State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1159 n.1 (R.I. 2005) (mem.). However, in my judgment, the footnote cited by the majority from Bergevine does not support the notion that credit for time served is inapplicable to probationary sentences. Indeed, it says that “[t]his provision [of § 12-19-2(a)] * * * is absolutely silent about such credit applying towards a probationary sentence or rendering a defendant’s sentencing date retroactive.” Bergevine, 883 A.2d at 1159 n.1. The defendant in Bergevine was seeking to have his time- served credits be applied retroactively in a creative effort to avoid being violated for a subsequent offense. However, acceptance of Bergevine’s argument would have created the farcical result of the defendant being on probation even before he had been sentenced. Id. at 1158. In contrast, Rose argues that he be required to serve only the amount of probation to which he was sentenced after his release from incarceration. The majority holds that Bergevine has already decided this issue, no matter how Rose “intellectualize[s]” it, but I do not believe Bergevine rings with such clarity. Should this Court choose to now hold that the statute prevents time served from being applied to probationary sentences, it certainly may. However, in my opinion, this is plowing upon new ground because our narrow holding in Bergevine did not come to that conclusion.', '- 25 -', 'To undergird its holding, the Bergevine Court appealed to common sense by quoting Justice William O. Douglas, who authored Peak v. United States, 353 U.S. 43, 46 (1957). Bergevine, 883 A.2d at 1159 (“That seems to us to be the common sense of the matter[,] and common sense often makes good law.”). In my view, however, common sense would dictate that whether Rose was on bail prior to trial or confined, his sentence should be twenty years minus any earned good-time credits. The majority’s holding, in my opinion, results in Rose serving twenty-one years and three months simply because he was held prior to trial. Incarcerated or serving probation with the suspended sentence hanging over his head like the sword of Damocles, defendant nevertheless has served twenty years. As I see it, Rose is simply asking this Court to recognize that to which he is entitled under a plain reading of the law.', 'As is the case with § 42-56-24, § 12-19-2 does not bar the application of credit for time served if that application would result in an offender serving less than a statutory minimum. In fact, we have held that credit for time served was specifically applicable. See Holmes, 108 R.I. at 585, 277 A.2d at 917. Although § 12-19-2 employs the term “reduced” instead of “deducted” as does § 42-56-24, this is a distinction without a difference. The majority’s holding effectively requires Rose to make up the fifteen months he served at the Adult Correctional Institutions awaiting disposition by extending his probation, an extension that the statute simply does not authorize this Court to do. In my opinion, the outcome Rose seeks is exactly what the General Assembly designed. Rose’s period of incarceration was reduced, and he served the twelve years of probation foisted upon him, which, with good-time credits, results in the completion of his sentence thirty-three months earlier than if he had been released on bail and had not earned good- time credits. This result not only appeals to common sense and is the most just, it also conforms with our existing case law and resolves the majority’s unexplained foray into the limbo created', '- 26 - by the inability to explain Rose’s status after his parole ended, but before his probation was supposed to start.', 'For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this case.', '- 27 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Alexander Rose v.

78,"Barbara C. Cayer : v. : Cox Rhode Island Telecom, LLC d/b/a Cox : Communications et al.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. In an October 2006 rear-end automobile accident, a work van being driven by the defendant, cable installer Nelson Ovalles, collided with the car of the plaintiff Barbara C. Cayer. As a result of that accident, Cayer filed a lawsuit against Nelson Ovalles and his wife, Flor, who owned the van, as well as the company on whose behalf Ovalles apparently performed cable-installation work, Cox Rhode Island Telecom, LLC d/b/a Cox Communications (Cox). After a Superior Court justice granted Cox’s motion for summary judgment, Cayer filed an appeal of the final judgment entered pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Before this Court, Cayer argues that genuine issues of material fact exist about whether Nelson Ovalles was an employee of Cox at the time of the accident. Additionally, Cayer appeals a second Superior Court justice’s decision to deny her motion to amend her complaint to assert claims against M&M Communications, Inc. (M&M), a', '-1- contractor for Cox, on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired. The plaintiff contends that, under the provisions of Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, the amended complaint relates back to the date of the original complaint. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment in favor of Cox, and we deny and dismiss the appeal with regard to the motion to amend because it is improperly before us.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'There is little or no dispute about the facts of this case. On October 23, 2006, at the intersection of Norwood Avenue and Broad Street in Cranston, plaintiff Barbara Cayer was stopped at a red light. Directly behind plaintiff’s car was a van that was being operated by defendant Nelson Ovalles, who was employed as a cable installer. According to Ovalles, while he was stopped at the red light, he glanced at a work order and then raised his eyes to see that the light had turned green. He said that he removed his foot from the brake in anticipation of proceeding through the intersection, but he instead rear-ended plaintiff’s car. The plaintiff alleged that she sustained injuries as a result of the accident.', 'On October 22, 2009, the day before the three-year statute of limitations for personal- injury actions was to expire, plaintiff sued Nelson Ovalles and his wife, Flor Ovalles. 1 The plaintiff also named Cox, a telecommunications service provider, as a defendant, alleging that that company was vicariously liable because it was “the agency wh[ich] controlled the use and purpose for the operation of the defendants’ vehicle[.]”', 'On August 16, 2010, Cox filed a third-party complaint against M&M, a company with which Cox previously had entered into an installation agreement.

Cox also alleged that M&M had failed to procure insurance, as required by the installation agreement.', 'Cox filed a motion for summary judgment on December 10, 2010, arguing that it could not be vicariously liable for the actions of Nelson Ovalles because it neither “own[ed] the vehicle nor did it have an employment contract or relationship with Mr. Ovalles.” After a hearing on June 28, 2011, a justice of the Superior Court agreed with Cox and granted the motion.', 'Confronted with the dismissal of Cox from the case, plaintiff then filed a motion to amend her complaint to include a direct claim against M&M. The motion to amend came before a different justice of the Superior Court, who denied the motion because the statute of limitations had expired with respect to any claims against M&M and because the amended complaint did not relate back to the date of the filing of the original complaint.', 'On September 20, 2011, final judgment was entered in favor of Cox pursuant to Rule 54(b). An order denying the motion to amend was entered on October 4, 2011.

Additional facts will be provided below where necessary.', '-3-', 'II', 'Summary Judgment', 'Much of the dispute in this case hinges on the nature of the relationship between Nelson Ovalles, M&M, and Cox. Cox maintains that Ovalles is not its employee, and it therefore cannot be held vicariously liable for his conduct.

Knowles, 739 A.2d 1183, 1185 (R.I. 1999). In that case, a patient sued a surgeon, alleging that he was liable vicariously for the negligence of anesthetists who had been in the operating room. We held that, despite the surgeon’s admissions that he requires an anesthetist to be present, no evidence had been presented that would demonstrate that the surgeon “controlled the work or conduct of the anesthesia personnel who supposedly caused [the patient’s injury].” Id. at 1185.', 'In the case before us at present, the facts on which plaintiff relies in an effort to demonstrate the existence of an employer-employee relationship are undisputed. In our opinion, there is no doubt that Nelson Ovalles was not an employee of Cox. The relationship between Cox and M&M is governed by the installation agreement. That document clearly provides that', '“Cox and [M&M] intend that the relationship between', 'them created by this Agreement is that of independent contractor.', 'No agent, employee, servant or subcontractor of [M&M] shall be', 'deemed to be the agent, employee, servant or subcontractor of', 'Cox.

Rhode Island State Employees’ Retirement Board, 935 A.2d 608, 611 (R.I. 2007) (citing Mazzei v. Rock-N-Around Trucking, Inc., 246 F.3d 956, 964 (7th Cir. 2001)). Also, Ovalles was paid by the job. By contrast, Cox paid its own employee technicians hourly, and they were given a vehicle, uniforms, boots, tools, rain gear, and snow gear, items that Cox did not provide to M&M’s technicians. Ovalles also was required to provide his own vehicle. The only equipment that Cox made available to M&M was a weekly supply of cable wire, fittings, and similar items. This equipment was not delivered to installers such as Ovalles, but rather to M&M. It was stored in M&M’s warehouse and was used by technicians on job sites to which they traveled in their own vehicles.', 'The record also reveals that Cox had minimal contact with M&M’s technicians. According to the deposition of David Gosselin, who was Cox’s contractor supervisor in 2006, Cox assigned work first to its own employees, and then to contractors like M&M. These “overflow” jobs would be assigned by M&M to technicians like Ovalles, each of whom was assigned a technician number. Cox had no knowledge of the identity of the technician who would actually perform the work at a particular job site. Cox did not provide any training to M&M technicians, and installation guidelines were largely dictated by state regulations.', 'Indeed, Cox’s only oversight consisted of spot inspections of work performed by M&M technicians, conducted one to three days after an installation. If one of those checks revealed 2', 'The Internal Revenue Code requires the payer of certain types of payments of $600 or more to file a form indicating the amount of payments and the recipient’s name and address. 26 U.S.C. § 6041.

United States, 88 F.3d 750, 752 (9th Cir. 1996).', '-7- that Cox had paid M&M for work that had been executed improperly, or not at all, Cox would “backcharge” M&M, but not the individual technician. Similarly, if an M&M technician did not arrive at a job site during the two-hour window that Cox had provided to its customer, Cox contacted M&M, not the technician.', 'Cox did not oversee or check the work of M&M’s technicians as it was being done. Even though technicians from both Cox and M&M may have worked at the same location at the same time, this would occur if, and only if, each had his or her own work order and each was installing a separate service, such as telephone, internet, or cable television.', 'It is beyond convincing to us that Cox did not have the requisite power to control the performance of Ovalles’s work and that he cannot be considered Cox’s employee. See Absi, 785 A.2d at 556; Lauro, 739 A.2d at 1185. Cox expressly renounced such control when it agreed, as is provided in the installation agreement, that it “[wa]s interested only in the results obtained under th[at] Agreement.”', 'Although M&M’s technicians were required to designate their affiliation with both M&M and Cox on their vehicles, clothing, and identification badges, this was necessary to notify customers that the technician who showed up at their homes or businesses was affiliated with the customer’s cable provider. 3 These identification requirements do not establish an ability to control a person’s performance as is required for an employer- employee relationship. Thus, we have no hesitation in holding that summary judgment in favor of Cox was proper. 3', 'The identification of Ovalles as associated with Cox may be grist for the mill for an argument based on apparent authority. This argument, however, has not been made to us, nor would such a theory appear to apply to these facts. Apparent authority may result in the liability of a principal if the principal held out someone as its agent and reliance upon the principal’s actions results in injury to a third party. George v. Fadiani, 772 A.2d 1065, 1069 (R.I. 2001) (citing Rodrigues v. Miriam Hospital, 623 A.2d 456, 462 (R.I. 1993)).

That motion was denied, and the order of the hearing justice was appealed to this Court. However, before we examine the merits of the appeal, we must consider whether it is properly before us. We conclude that it is not.', 'The record indicates that, although Cox received a Rule 54(b) judgment in the Superior Court, the case moves on in that tribunal. The claims against Nelson and Flor Ovalles remain unresolved, and the order denying the motion to amend to assert claims against M&M is interlocutory.', 'See Simpson v.

In a case of first impression, we are asked to determine whether a usury savings clause in a commercial loan document validates an otherwise usurious contract. In view of the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that it does not; we hold, therefore, that the promissory note at issue is void as a matter of law.', 'The defendant, Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, (PRC or defendant) appeals from the Superior Court’s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, NV One, LLC, Nicholas E. Cambio, and Vincent A. Cambio (collectively, NV One or plaintiffs). The defendant asserts that the trial justice erred when he granted plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on liability for violation of the usury statute, G.L. 1956 § 6-26-2, by declaring the usury savings clause of the parties’ loan agreement unenforceable. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History 1', 'In 2007, plaintiffs sought a loan to rehabilitate and renovate a former post office located at 1190 Main Street in the Town of West Warwick (property). On July 17, 2007, NV One entered into a loan agreement with PRC and signed a promissory note (note) for the principal amount of $1,800,000; as security for the loan, NV One granted a mortgage, assignment of leases and rents, security agreement, and fixture filing with respect to the property.', 'The plaintiffs Nicholas E. Cambio and Vincent A. Cambio also personally guaranteed the loan.', 'In addition to the note, mortgage, and related documents, at the closing of the loan the parties executed a Sources and Uses of Funds sheet and a Loan Disbursement Authorization (all collectively, the loan documents). The loan documents established both an “interest reserve” and a “renovation reserve,” set initially at $62,500 and $940,000, respectively. Monthly interest-only payments were due on the first day of each calendar month until the loan’s maturity date of August 1, 2008, on which date final payment of both the unpaid interest and unpaid principal was to be made. The note set an interest rate at “the greater of 5.3% or the LIBOR Rate, plus 4.7%.” 2 The note also set a “default rate” at “the lesser of (a) twenty-four percent (24%) per annum and (b) the maximum rate of interest, if any, which may be collected * * * under applicable law.” The loan documents also imposed fees, including an exit fee of $18,000 and an 1', 'Only a portion of the record was certified to this Court. The facts, which are not disputed, are gleaned largely from the trial justice’s written decision. The trial justice relied almost exclusively on the complaint and the August 17, 2011 affidavit of Nicholas E. Cambio and the exhibits attached thereto. 2', 'LIBOR, which stands for “London Interbank Offered Rate,” is defined as “[a] daily compilation by the British Bankers Association of the rates that major international banks charge each other for large-volume, short-term loans of Eurodollars, with monthly maturity rates calculated out to one year.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1027 (9th ed. 2009).', '-2- origination fee of $25,000. The Sources and Uses of Funds sheet also notes a previous deposit of $15,000, raising the total value of the loan to $1,815,000.', 'At the heart of this case are the maximum interest provisions contained in both the note and the mortgage; as the trial justice noted in his decision, “[t]hese provisions attempt to conform the instruments to the local usury laws, and they are commonly known as usury savings clauses.” Section 4.4 of the note, titled “Maximum Amount,” provides a usury savings clause, which reads in pertinent part:', '“A. It is the intention of Maker [NV One] and Payee', '[PRC] to conform strictly to the usury and similar laws relating to', 'interest from time to time in force, and all agreements between', 'Maker and Payee, whether now existing or hereafter arising and', 'whether oral or written, are hereby expressly limited so that in no', 'contingency or event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of', 'maturity hereof or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be', 'paid in the aggregate to Payee as interest hereunder or under the', 'other Loan Documents or in any other security agreement given to', 'secure the Loan Amount, or in any other document evidencing,', 'securing or pertaining to the Loan Amount, exceed the maximum', 'amount permissible under applicable usury or such other laws (the', '‘Maximum Amount’).', '“B.

The trial justice attributed this, in part, to the holdbacks for the $940,000 renovation reserve and the $62,500 interest reserve. 3 Although the loan documents required both reserves to be placed 3', 'The interest reserve was increased from $62,500 to $63,000 on September 1, 2007.', '-3- in escrow, PRC never actually placed funds in escrow, nor did it segregate the funds in any way. Critically, section 2.12 of the note provided that NV One would not accrue any interest on the reserved funds.', 'At the time of closing there was a net funding disbursement of $761,478.54; and, in January 2008, a disbursement of $143,877.50 was made from the renovation reserve at the request of NV One.', 'The note contained a provision in section 2.7 allowing the parties to extend the date of maturity for up to an additional twelve months, provided certain conditions were met. Pursuant to that provision, on August 1, 2008, NV One paid PRC $18,000 in consideration for the execution of an allonge, 4 which extended the maturity date by ten months to June 1, 2009. The $18,000 and the interest payments on the allonge were paid out of the interest reserve. By September 2008, NV One had received $995,997.50 of the $1.8 million loan. By November 2008, the interest reserve was exhausted. By the new date of maturity, NV One received, at most, $1,007,390.52 on the $1.8 million loan.', 'Although PRC never disbursed the entire $1.8 million loan amount, it routinely charged NV One interest for the entire loan amount. In his decision, the trial justice noted that “[p]rior to the allonge, PRC charged interest at ten percent (10%) of the total $1.8 million, when as little as $761,478.54 was disbursed.” From the time of the execution of the allonge in August 2008 through February 2009, “PRC charged NV One interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) of the total $1.8 million, despite the fact that at its height, $1,007,390.52 was actually disbursed to NV 4', 'Although the document itself is titled “Allonge to Note” and is referenced by the trial justice and the parties as such, “allonge” appears to be a misnomer.

In March 2009, at the end of the thirty days, “PRC charged NV One the [d]efault rate of twenty-four percent (24%) interest calculated upon the $1.8 million face amount of the [n]ote.” The trial justice found that “[w]hen the interest charged is applied in the context of the amount actually disbursed, the rate exceeds twenty-one percent (21%) essentially throughout the loan.” The trial justice further found that “PRC never adjusted the amount of interest charged to lower it below twenty-one percent (21%).”', 'Due to NV One’s alleged failure to pay off the loan by the maturity date of June 1, 2009, on October 9, 2009, PRC sent NV One a notice of default and payment demand. On November 5, 2009, pursuant to its rights under the mortgage, PRC sent a foreclosure notice to NV One. 5 In addition, on or about November 19, 2009, PRC sent a demand notice to plaintiffs Nicholas E. Cambio and Vincent A. Cambio demanding payment pursuant to their personal guarantees. On December 14, 2009, plaintiffs filed a verified complaint against PRC claiming fraud, breach of contract, and usury, and seeking injunctive relief preventing foreclosure on the property and collection from the personal guarantors. 6 On August 16, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to liability on count 3 of the complaint, alleging violations of the Rhode Island usury law. 7 5', 'Neither of these letters are contained in the record certified to this Court nor are they contained in either party’s appendices. 6', 'The plaintiffs subsequently amended the complaint on December 22, 2009, and April 26, 2010. 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 6-26-2.', '-5-', 'On December 16, 2011, the trial justice filed a written decision granting plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment. On January 11, 2012, the trial justice entered an order 8 declaring the loan usurious and void, voiding the mortgage, and removing the liens on the property from the land records. In his written decision, the trial justice found that “[i]t is clear on the record of undisputed facts that the rate was undoubtedly usurious, at least for some period.” In reaching that decision, the trial justice stated that the Rhode Island usury statute generally sets the maximum allowable rate of interest at 21 percent. He further noted that “[t]o determine whether an interest rate is usurious, the value for computing the maximum permissible interest is not the amount on the face of the loan, but, rather, the actual amount received by the borrower.” He then analyzed the interest rates PRC charged during each period of the loan (10 percent, 12 percent, and 24 percent) and determined that, because these percentages were calculated using the entire $1.8 million loan amount—as opposed to the $1,007,390.52 PRC actually distributed to NV One—“[t]here can be no doubt that these interest amounts charged exceeded twenty-one percent (21%) of the disbursed loan.”', 'The trial justice next considered the applicability of the usury savings clause “in light of the public policy, legislative intent, and plain meaning of the Rhode Island usury law.” The trial justice embarked on an extensive analysis of the policies behind Rhode Island usury jurisprudence, as well as the law in states with substantially developed usury law, such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. In ultimately declining to honor the usury savings clause and granting plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment, the trial justice stated that “[l]ending effect to a usury savings clause would contradict this state’s articulated public policy in favor of the borrower and against usurious transactions.” 8', 'The order was not contained in the record certified to this Court.', '-6-', 'The defendant timely appealed the January 11, 2012 order. The trial justice then stayed his ruling for forty-five days and, after a February 17, 2012 meeting with the parties’ attorneys, issued a further stay pending consideration of the motion by this Court. The motion to stay came before this Court on March 14, 2012, after which this Court vacated the trial justice’s stay but enjoined plaintiffs from alienating the property without prior authorization from this Court.', 'On appeal, PRC does not challenge the factual findings of the trial justice; rather it contends that the trial justice “erred when [he] granted [NV One’s] motion for partial summary judgment on liability for violation of [G.L. 1956] § 6-26-2 by declaring the usury savings clause of the loan agreement unenforceable.” The enforceability of usury savings clauses is an issue of first impression before this Court, and PRC argues that such clauses should be enforceable under Rhode Island law. In its reply brief, PRC maintains that the trial justice “erred in failing to perform a proper analysis when it rendered a commercial contract term unenforceable on the grounds of public policy.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment ‘de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Carreiro v. Tobin, 66 A.3d 820, 822 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Great American E & S Insurance Co. v. End Zone Pub & Grill of Narragansett, Inc., 45 A.3d 571, 574 (R.I. 2012)). “[S]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Id.

Section 6-26-2(a). Contracts in violation of § 6-26-2 are usurious and void, and the borrower is entitled to recover any amount paid on the loan. Section 6-26-4. The lender’s subjective intent to comply with the usury laws is immaterial. Burdon v. Unrath, 47 R.I. 227, 231, 132 A. 728, 730 (1926). In order to determine whether an interest rate is usurious, the face amount of the loan is irrelevant; instead, the maximum allowable interest is calculated based on the amount actually received by the borrower. See Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island v. Stuard, 113 R.I. 124, 125, 318 A.2d 452, 453 (1974). Because neither party disputes the material facts, i.e., that PRC charged NV One interest in excess of the permissible 21 percent maximum, 9 the applicability of the usury savings clause is determinative of whether NV One is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.', 'PRC’s Usurious Interest Rate', 'Setting aside for the moment the usury savings clause, it is abundantly clear to this Court that the loan between PRC and NV One was usurious. However, because only a portion of the record was certified to this Court and the numbers contained therein are undisputed, we will not belabor the analysis any more than is necessary to determine usury. According to PRC’s Loan 9', 'Despite the fact that the parties agree that the interest rates were usurious, this Court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo, and we will review the numbers to either confirm or deny the usury violation.', '-8- Activity Report, from the inception of the loan on July 17, 2007, through August 31, 2007, PRC disbursed only $797,500 of the entire $1.8 million loan amount. In accordance with the Sources and Uses sheet of the loan document, the $62,500 interest reserve and the $940,000 renovation reserve—which constitute the balance of the loan—were required to be placed in escrow by PRC. However, according to Nicholas E. Cambio’s sworn affidavit, these funds were not placed in escrow, but were merely established as “journal entries” by PRC. Nevertheless, PRC charged NV One interest at a rate of 10.125 percent for August 2007, calculated against the entire $1.8 million loan amount, for a total interest charge of $15,693.75.', 'The fact that PRC calculated the interest amount against the face amount of the loan as opposed to the amount of the disbursed funds is of critical importance to the usury determination. See Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island, 113 R.I. at 125, 318 A.2d at 453. For instance, the August interest charge, when calculated against the actual disbursed amount, as is necessary to determine usury, results in an effective interest rate of 23.17 percent per annum. 10 Because PRC and NV One entered into a valid loan contract, and the 23.17 percent interest rate that PRC charged exceeds the 21 percent maximum interest rate set out in § 6-26-2, it is clear to us that the loan was usurious and therefore void. 11', 'However, one need not engage in complex arithmetic in order to discern usury in PRC’s loan. In the event of default by NV One, the note imposed a default interest rate at “the lesser of (a) twenty-four percent (24%) per annum and (b) the maximum rate of interest, if any, which 10', 'The $15,693.75 averages out to $506.25 per day in interest charges, and a total of $184,781.25 per year. In order to generate $184,781.25 in annual interest on a $797,500 loan (the actual disbursed amount), interest must be charged at a rate of 23.17 percent. 11', 'It bears mentioning that during the entire life of the loan PRC routinely calculated interest against the $1.8 million amount, despite the fact that the most that PRC ever disbursed to NV One was $1,007,390.52. Thus, the actual interest rate was in excess of 21 percent for the majority of the loan.', '-9- may be collected * * * under applicable law.” This 24 percent interest rate is usurious on its face. See § 6-26-2. Moreover, during the default period, PRC did not attempt to conform the charged interest to the maximum rate allowable by law (21 percent), but instead demanded the full 24 percent. The following sequence of events is illustrative. On February 23, 2009, PRC sent NV One a notice of default, 12 providing NV One with thirty days to cure the default before PRC would impose the default interest rate.', 'On April 8, 2009, PRC sent another letter13 indicating that NV One had defaulted and PRC would be imposing the default interest rate, retroactive to March 24, 2009. Finally, on November 19, 2009, PRC sent the Cambios a demand for payment pursuant to their personal guarantee, demanding full payment of the $1,007,390.52, plus an additional $464,487.62 in back interest and fees. The back interest PRC demanded— $382,800—consists partly of $296,800 in interest charged during the default period of March 24, 2009, through November 17, 2009. PRC calculated this latter figure by applying the default 24 percent rate to the $1.8 million face value of the loan. The 24 percent rate is facially usurious irrespective of the loan amount; however, when calculated against the actual disbursed amount, that rate skyrockets to 43.48 percent per annum, 14 more than double the maximum permissible interest rate. Therefore, it is apparent to this Court that not only did PRC charge a usurious interest rate, but it made no attempt to lower the interest charges to conform to the maximum permissible interest rate. 12', 'This notice is not contained in the record certified to this Court. 13', 'Once again, not in the record. 14', 'PRC charged the default rate of 24 percent for the 239 days of the default period from March 24, 2009, through November 17, 2009, for an interest charge of $1,200 per day. $1,200 per day amounts to $438,000 annually, which, when calculated against the $1,007,390.52 disbursed amount, results in an annualized interest rate of 43.48 percent.', '- 10 -', 'The Usury Savings Clause', 'Having determined that the loan is usurious, we turn now to the applicability of the usury savings clause. 15 It is well settled in Rhode Island that “a contract term is unenforceable only if it violates public policy.” Gorman v. St. Raphael Academy, 853 A.2d 28, 39 (R.I. 2004). A contract, or a term contained therein violates public policy only if it is: “[1] injurious to the interests of the public, [2] interferes with the public welfare or safety, [3] is unconscionable; or [4] tends to injustice or oppression.” Id. (quoting City of Warwick v. Boeng Corp., 472 A.2d 1214, 1218 (R.I. 1984)). In order to decide whether the enforcement of a usury savings clause violates public policy, we must first determine the public policy underlying the usury laws in general. Although some states’ statutes explicitly articulate the policy behind their usury laws, 16 the Rhode Island usury statutory scheme is relatively brief and makes no mention of public policy or legislative intent. See chapter 26 of title 6. It is therefore incumbent upon this Court to discern the public policy undergirding the usury laws. To that end, we begin by first examining the plain language of the statute.', 'The pertinent language of the Rhode Island usury statute states, without qualification, that “no person, partnership, association, or corporation loaning money * * * shall, directly or indirectly, reserve, charge, or take interest on a loan, whether before or after maturity, at a rate 15', 'We begin this analysis by rejecting PRC’s contention that the case should be remanded because the trial justice “erred in failing to perform a proper analysis when [he] rendered [the usury savings clause] unenforceable on the grounds of public policy.” Because this Court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo, whether or not the trial justice failed to conduct a proper analysis with regard to the usury savings clause has no bearing on PRC’s appeal. See Carreiro v. Tobin, 66 A.3d 820, 822 (R.I. 2013). 16', 'See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 24-2.1(g) (West 2007) (“It is the paramount public policy of North Carolina to protect North Carolina resident borrowers through the application of North Carolina interest laws.”); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 19.52.005. (West 1999) (“[The usury statutes] are enacted in order to protect the residents of this state from debts bearing burdensome interest rates; * * * and in recognition of the duty to protect our citizens from oppression generally.”).', '- 11 - which shall exceed * * * twenty-one percent (21%) per annum * * * .” Section 6-26-2(a). The use of the word “shall” evinces a certainty; in other words, a lender that charges interest in excess of 21 percent is liable for usury. Additionally, the fact that the Legislature explicitly delineated only one specific exception 17 to the maximum interest rate indicates a consideration (and rejection) of any and all other circumstances whereby a lender may charge interest in excess of 21 percent. The criminal usury statute, § 6-26-3 criminalizes “willful[] and knowing[]” violations of the maximum interest rate, thereby further underscoring the immateriality of a lender’s intent in determining civil usury under § 6-26-2. Because the lender’s intent to charge an interest rate exceeding the permissible maximum is immaterial to a determination of usury (and the invocation of penalties resulting therefrom), it is clear that the Legislature intended an inflexible, hardline approach to usury that is tantamount to strict liability. 18', 'This rigid approach is borne out in the historically strict enforcement of the statute and its predecessors through the years. In a 1926 decision concerning a prior usury statute, this Court rejected a lender’s argument that he had intended to abide by the maximum interest limits, holding that lack of intent “is no excuse for the violation of the statute.” Burdon, 47 R.I. at 231, 132 A. at 730. The Court stated that “[t]o hold otherwise would violate an established principle of law, and would furnish to avaricious lenders a convenient excuse for an evasion of the law.” Id. Three years later, the Court once again denied a lender’s contention that his lack of intent to violate the statute should alleviate his liability for usury. Colonial Plan Co. v. Tartaglione, 50 R.I. 342, 344, 147 A. 880, 881 (1929). The Court rejected the notion that a borrower can 17', 'See § 6-26-2(e) (no limit on interest rate for a commercial borrower, over $1,000,000, where loan is not secured against principal residence of the borrower, and pro forma analysis by a certified CPA indicates that loan is capable of being repaid). 18', 'We are not confronted in this case with a good faith bookkeeping error, be it human or electronic.', '- 12 - contract with a lender to pay more than the permissible interest rate because “[t]o permit it would open the door to the very abuses and opportunities to take advantage of small borrowers which the statute is designed to prevent.” Id. In 1951, this Court, in upholding the recovery of both interest and principal payments by an aggrieved borrower remarked that “[p]lainly the policy of the legislature was to provide severe penalties against the lender for his violation of the statute as the best method in its judgment to prevent usurious transactions.” Nazarian v. Lincoln Finance Corp., 77 R.I. 497, 505, 78 A.2d 7, 10 (1951). In what was seemingly a note of caution to future lenders, the Court warned that “[i]f the result seems harsh the penalty can be avoided easily by writing loan agreements that exact no more than the law allows.” Id. Although these cases concern prior iterations of the usury statute, the underlying policy consistent throughout the decisions is readily apparent: Usurious interest rates are to be avoided at all costs and the onus is on the lender to ensure compliance with the maximum rate of interest.', 'The strict policy against usurious transactions has continued in the case law concerning the current usury statute. In a 1982 decision permitting a debtor to waive the defense of usury, this Court acknowledged a “clear legislative intent to provide severe penalties against lenders who violate the usury laws,” and noted that the usury statutes clearly manifest “[a] strong public policy against usurious transactions.” DeFusco v. Giorgio, 440 A.2d 727, 732 (R.I. 1982).', 'Although not binding on this Court, two decisions from the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island concerning usury in the context of bankruptcy proceedings are illustrative of the public policy underlying the usury statute. In declining to apply the in pari delicto doctrine against a borrower of a usurious loan, the district court judge, citing § 6-26-2, found that “Rhode Island usury law places the burden of charging a legal interest rate on the lender.” Sheehan v. Richardson, 315 B.R. 226, 240 (Bankr. D. R.I. 2004), aff’d, 185 F.App’x 11', '- 13 - (1st Cir. 2006). The judge further rejected the notion that the borrower agreeing to the terms of the loan absolves the lender from liability for usurious interest rates, stating that “[d]espite mutual assent to the terms, Rhode Island statutes do not punish the borrower.” Id. at 241. Yet perhaps the most telling reflection of the rigidity of the usury statute is the Bankruptcy Court’s decision in In re Swartz, where the court found that a $4 filing fee—which accounted for the only interest in excess of the maximum interest rate—rendered the entire loan usurious. In re Swartz, 37 B.R. 776, 779 (Bankr. D. R.I. 1984). The “[d]raconian tenor” of the statute, the judge noted, is “intended to protect borrowers from hidden and pernicious interest charges, and places total responsibility upon the lender for strict compliance.” Id. at 779 & n.5. The judge continued: “To allow a lender who has collected or retained fees in excess of the legal limit to plead ‘innocent mistake’ after discovery of the overcharge by the debtor, would surely invite precisely the kind of abuse which the statute is designed to prevent.” Id. at 779.', 'In our opinion, the analyses of the Bankruptcy Court, as well as the prior opinions of this Court accurately and convincingly evince the public policy behind the usury statute: For protection of the borrower, it is incumbent upon the lender to ensure full compliance with the provisions for maximum rate of interest, and, apart from the explicit exception in § 6-26-2(e), anything short of full compliance renders the transaction usurious and void.', 'PRC argues that because the two parties are “sophisticated business entities,” they should be bound by the usury savings clause to which they agreed, and that allowing NV One to void the loan would not further public policy. In support, PRC offers a series of statutes from foreign jurisdictions, all of which foreclose corporations from asserting usury as a defense. While most corporations may indeed be better able to protect themselves from avaricious lenders than other less sophisticated borrowers, PRC’s argument entirely misses the mark. The Rhode Island usury', '- 14 - statute not only contemplated lender/borrower relationships between commercial business entities, but provided a statutory exception to usury for that very situation. That exception to the maximum rate of interest is laid out in § 6-26-2(e), which provides:', '“Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this', 'section and/or any other provision in this chapter to the contrary,', 'there is no limitation on the rate of interest which may be legally', 'charged for the loan to, or use of money by, a commercial entity,', 'where the amount of money loaned exceeds the sum of one million', 'dollars ($1,000,000) and where repayment of the loan is not', 'secured by a mortgage against the principal residence of any', 'borrower; provided, that the commercial entity has first obtained a', 'pro forma methods analysis performed by a certified public', 'accountant licensed in the state of Rhode Island indicating that the', 'loan is capable of being repaid.” By its plain language, this allows a lender to charge any interest rate it pleases without the possibility of a usury violation, provided that certain conditions are met in advance of the loan. 19 There is a binary dynamic implicit in the usury statute whereby a lender is either bound by the maximum interest provision and all its constituent penalties, or it is completely free from them. In our opinion, the very existence of this exception underscores the policies of borrower protection and lender accountability ingrained in the usury statute and its companion case law by recognizing that some borrowers are different, and thus not entitled to the statute’s “drastic” protections. See Colonial Plan Co., 50 R.I. at 345, 147 A. at 881.', 'With these underlying public policies in mind, we turn next to the applicability of savings clauses in general. In our view, the enforcement of usury savings clauses would entirely obviate any responsibility on the part of the lender to abide by the usury statute, and would, in essence, swallow the rule.', 'As articulated supra, there is a strong public policy against usurious 19', 'It bears mentioning that, because the two parties are commercial entities, the loan exceeded $1,000,000, and was not secured by either of the Cambios’ primary residences, the loan at issue surely qualified for the exception. By not securing the requisite pro forma analysis, PRC failed to avail itself of the exception and is therefore bound by the maximum interest rate.', '- 15 - transactions, with lenders—typically in a better position to understand the terms of the loan— bearing the burden of compliance. See DeFusco, 440 A.2d at 732. If lenders could circumvent the maximum interest rate by including a boilerplate usury savings clause, lenders could charge excessive rates without recourse. This would have the reverse effect of incentivizing lenders to attempt to charge excessive interest rates because, at worst, the lender could invoke the savings clause and the interest rate would simply be reduced to the highest acceptable rate without any penalty to the lender. There is no doubt that such a mechanism runs completely afoul of the clear public policy against usurious transactions.', 'In addition to incentivizing usurious interest rates, giving effect to usury savings clauses would rest the burden of ensuring compliance squarely on the shoulders of the borrower. We firmly agree with the analysis of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, which, in declining to allow a lender to invoke a usury savings clause to shield itself from liability for usury, stated:', '“The [usury] statute relieves the borrower of the necessity for', 'expertise and vigilance regarding the legality of rates he must pay.', 'That onus is placed instead on the lender, whose business it is to', 'lend money for profit and who is thus in a better position than the', 'borrower to know the law. A ‘usury savings clause,’ if valid,', 'would shift the onus back onto the borrower, contravening', 'statutory policy and depriving the borrower of the benefit of the', 'statute’s protection and penalties.” Swindell v. Federal National', 'Mortgage Association, 409 S.E.2d 892, 896 (N.C. 1991). We have no doubt that the inclusion of usury savings clauses in loan contracts would lead to results that are injurious to the money-borrowing public, as well as potentially unconscionable or tending towards injustice or oppression. See Gorman, 853 A.2d at 39. We therefore hold that, in loan contracts such as the instant loan, usury savings clauses are unenforceable as against the well-established public policy of preventing usurious transactions.', '- 16 -', 'Based on our de novo review, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PRC, it is clear to this Court that the loan was a usury in violation of § 6-26-2. Furthermore, because we hold that the usury savings clause is unenforceable on public policy grounds, there are no remaining issues of material fact and NV One is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Therefore the trial justice’s grant of partial summary judgment for NV One on count 3 was proper, and we have no cause to reverse his decision.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Mary Cummings, a participant in a charitable fundraising walk for the benefit of the defendants, Project Hope/Projecto Esperanza, Inc. (Project Hope) and the Diocesan Bureau of Social Services (Diocesan Bureau), suffered personal injuries when she was struck by a truck operated by the plaintiff, James W. Brown1 (Brown), an employee of the plaintiff Bluelinx Corporation (plaintiff or Bluelinx).', 'She subsequently settled all claims against all the defendants. In this appeal, Bluelinx seeks review of a Superior Court order granting Project Hope and the Diocesan Bureau’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and conditionally granting a motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The peregrination of this case commenced on March 25, 2005—Good Friday—when approximately 200 walkers arrived at Notre Dame Church in Central Falls, Rhode Island, to participate in the annual Good Friday Walk sponsored on behalf of Project Hope and the 1', 'Although the case caption still contains his name, James W. Brown no longer is a party to the proceedings following a voluntary dismissal, without prejudice, entered on June 10, 2010.', '-1- Diocesan Bureau. Upon arriving, the participants entered through the rear of the church and registered for the walk in the basement. The walkers then proceeded upstairs for a brief prayer service in the church. Next, they exited through the front of the church, descended the steps, and made their way across Broad Street to Sacred Heart Avenue. The walkers then proceeded along a predetermined route through Central Falls, Pawtucket, Lincoln, and Cumberland.', 'In addition to the walkers, staff members and volunteers were present to help facilitate the Good Friday Walk, including Elmer Stanley (Stanley), the executive director of Project Hope, Kerry O’Connell (O’Connell), Project Hope’s parish outreach coordinator, and Roselyn Vredenburgh (Vredenburgh), a long-time employee of Project Hope. As the walkers exited the church, O’Connell positioned herself in the middle of Broad Street in order to stop traffic as the walkers proceeded to cross the street.', 'When the entire group of walkers had crossed the thoroughfare, O’Connell noticed Mary Cummings (Cummings) standing on the church steps. According to O’Connell, it wasn’t clear whether Cummings was a participant in the walk; however, Stanley—who was standing on the sidewalk outside the church—indicated to O’Connell that he would assist Cummings in crossing the street. By then, the group of walkers had crossed Broad Street; O’Connell waved the traffic on and returned to the sidewalk. According to James W. Brown (Brown), the operator of an eighteen-wheel tractor trailer who had stopped a block before the church at a traffic light, the light changed approximately two to four times before all the participants made their way across Broad Street and the traffic began to move.', 'Brown testified that he drove the Bluelinx tractor trailer forward on Broad Street and activated the truck’s turn signal, intending to turn left onto Sacred Heart Avenue. As Brown passed the church on his right, he veered right in order to position the cab of the truck at an angle', '-2- to facilitate the left turn. Because the traffic had been stopped for so long, oncoming traffic was heavy and Brown was forced to wait one to two minutes before he was able to negotiate the turn.', 'Meanwhile, Cummings was making her way down the church steps when Stanley approached her. Stanley testified that Cummings was a petite elderly woman, about five feet tall, who was using a cane as she slowly descended the stairs. When Stanley asked Cummings if he could assist her across the street, Cummings retorted, “Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?” When Stanley indicated that he was, Cummings responded, “I don’t need any help.” Nonetheless, Stanley asked again whether Cummings needed help, to which she emphatically replied, “No. They will stop for me.” Sensing that he had offended her, Stanley apologized to Cummings and continued toward the church entrance.', 'As he climbed the stairs, Stanley stopped and turned to watch Cummings reach the base of the stairs and make her way across the sidewalk. When Cummings approached the curb, she waved her hand at Brown’s tractor trailer, which was then stopped waiting to turn left. Stanley then resumed his climb up the stairs when a friend asked him, “Is she going to make it?” Stanley then turned once more and saw Cummings walking “right up against the side” of Brown’s tractor trailer—which was still stopped—and replied “yes.” Stanley was nearing the church entrance when he heard Cummings scream. According to Brown, a driver approaching from the opposite direction had motioned for Brown to proceed, and he began turning left onto Sacred Heart Avenue when he heard what sounded like metal hitting the pavement. Brown immediately stopped the truck, exited the cab and walked around to the front passenger side where he discovered Cummings pinned behind the front wheel. Brown later testified that he had not seen her.', 'Although Cummings was grievously injured, no suit was filed on her behalf. Rather, on', '-3- July 13, 2007, Cummings accepted $1,450,000 in full settlement and signed a release of all claims against Brown, Bluelinx, Project Hope, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, Stanley, and O’Connell. This release indicated that all payments were made by or on behalf of Bluelinx and its driver, Brown, “who have discharged the common liability of the additional joint tortfeasors.” The release also indicated that “[a]ll parties to this release acknowledge the intent of [Bluelinx and Brown] to proceed against all other joint tortfeasors named or released by reference under the terms of this document to the extent of their pro rata share of this settlement.”', 'On August 3, 2007, Bluelinx and Brown filed suit against Project Hope, the Diocesan Bureau, and Stanley (collectively defendants) seeking contribution toward the settlement.2 By way of answer, defendants denied liability and asserted, as an affirmative defense, that no duty of care or breach of such duty were present in this case. The defendants later filed motions for summary judgment, in which they argued that they were under no duty to protect Cummings from plaintiff’s tortious acts while she was on a public highway. The defendants also argued that no duty existed under principles of premises liability, because Cummings was not injured while on defendants’ property.3 Finally, Stanley argued that plaintiff’s claims against him should be dismissed because he was at all times acting within the scope of his employment with Project Hope. 2', 'In the original complaint, Brown was the only named plaintiff, and Stanley, Project Hope, and the Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence were named defendants. A first amended complaint was filed four days later on August 7, 2007, naming the Diocesan Bureau as a defendant in place of the bishop. On April 18, 2008, a second amended complaint was filed naming Brown and Bluelinx as plaintiffs, and Stanley, Project Hope, and the Diocesan Bureau as defendants. As noted previously, Brown was voluntarily dismissed as a party plaintiff on June 10, 2010. 3', 'In its Superior Court papers filed in opposition to summary judgment, Bluelinx conceded that premises liability did not apply to the facts of the case.', '-4-', 'A Superior Court justice heard the motions on February 22, 2011, and denied summary judgment for Project Hope and the Diocesan Bureau, finding that the facts of this case established a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of the walkers. The trial justice did, however, grant summary judgment “as to Elmer Stanley in his individual capacity,” finding that “all [parties] seem to agree that he was there in his capacity as Executive Director of Project Hope.” An order entered in favor of Stanley, who then moved for entry of separate and final judgment in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Over plaintiff’s objection, final judgment was entered in favor of Stanley on March 24, 2011.4', 'On December 5, 2011, a jury trial commenced; as part of its case-in-chief, Bluelinx presented Brown and also called Stanley as an adverse witness. The deposition testimony of Vredenburgh was read to the jury, and O’Connell testified by way of a video deposition. After plaintiff rested, counsel for defendants indicated that they wished to argue a motion, and also read certain stipulated facts into the record.5 The stipulated facts established that, if William Cummings—the brother of Mary Cummings—had testified, his testimony would establish that his sister had participated in the Good Friday Walk for many years, and that before the incident, she customarily would walk—weather permitting—about two miles per day, and regularly swim for about an hour a day at the local pool. The defense then rested and pressed its motion for judgment as a matter of law. 4', 'Bluelinx filed a timely notice of appeal concerning this judgment; however, it later requested that the Court stay the appeal pending resolution of the remaining claims. We granted the stay and remanded the case to the Superior Court. The appeal concerning the grant of summary judgment and entry of final judgment in favor of Stanley, docketed as No. 2011-177-A., was also heard by this Court, but will be decided in a separate order. 5', 'Prior to reading the stipulated facts, defense counsel stated that there was a motion, which he understood the court was going to defer ruling on; the trial justice agreed. Although not specifically delineated, we assume the motion was for judgment as a matter of law.', '-5-', 'After hearing both parties’ arguments, the trial justice declared that he would “reluctantly let the case go to the jury,” and denied the motion. He indicated, however, that based on the facts of the case, “the issue of duty [was] of great concern” to him, and he questioned whether this Court’s holding in Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682 (R.I. 1994), was controlling. The trial justice later instructed the jury that “the defendants owed a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of persons participating in the walk.” The jury was asked to determine whether any of the defendants were “guilty of negligence which was, in part, the proximate cause of the injuries suffered by Ms. Cummings.”', 'The jury answered this question in the affirmative, and apportioned defendants’ fault at twenty percent.', 'The defendants subsequently filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and also moved, in the alternative, for a new trial. The trial justice granted the renewed Rule 50 motion, finding that “there was not a legally sufficient basis for the jury’s verdict.” The trial justice further stated that, “if any duty existed, it ended” when Cummings definitively refused Stanley’s offer to help her cross the street. Moreover, the trial justice rejected plaintiff’s “effort to create a duty” based on Cummings’ age and infirmity, finding the contention to be inconsistent with the uncontradicted evidence—stipulated to by the parties—that Cummings had participated in the Good Friday Walk for many years, and that she swam and walked regularly before the incident. The trial justice declared that there was an insufficient legal basis for the jury to find defendants negligent, and granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law.6 The plaintiff filed a 6', 'The trial justice also concluded that, “for the same reasons,” the jury’s verdict was contrary to the evidence and weight thereof, and conditionally granted defendants’ motion for a new trial. However, based on our conclusion that defendants did not owe a duty of care to Cummings under the facts of this case, we need not pass upon the trial justice’s conditional grant of a new trial.

In support of this holding, we annunciated five principles: (1) that our statutes and case law clearly show that the “control and regulation of traffic is a duty allocated to the government, not to private individuals”; (2) that the church had no control over the property on which the injury occurred, regardless of whether the church had ever requested traffic control for the public way; (3) the church had no control over the instrumentality causing the injury; (4) if a duty were imposed upon landowners to patrol traffic on public ways, the “line which would cut off the landowner’s liability [then] becomes nearly impossible to draw”; and (5) that the public at large, rather than an individual landowner, should bear the expense of traffic control. Id. at 686-87 (internal quotes omitted).', 'The plaintiffs in Ferreira also advanced the alternative argument that, even if a duty did not exist, the church voluntarily assumed a duty to control traffic through its past conduct of contacting the police and requesting that officers be assigned to control traffic outside the church. Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 684. This Court rejected that argument, concluding that “[t]he', '-9- same principles that militated against the duty to control traffic on public highways would also preclude the gratuitous assumption of such a duty.” Id. at 688. We explained that although landowners—such as a theater or department store, for example—may on occasion attract a large number of patrons and therefore have a significant interest in the condition of traffic on abutting public ways, “this interest cannot be transformed into a duty of control by the landowner’s requests to municipal or other governmental authorities to perform duties that are wholly governmental in nature.” Id. at 689. Accordingly, this Court stated that an abutting landowner could not gratuitously assume a duty to control traffic on a public way, regardless of whether that landowner had—however frequently or infrequently—requested aid in controlling traffic in the past.', 'We deem our holding in Ferreira controlling in this case. The plaintiff attempts to distinguish Ferreira, however, by contending that, unlike the case at bar, the church in Ferreira did nothing to ensure the safety of the parishioners as they crossed the street after Midnight Mass. In this case, plaintiff argues, defendants assumed a duty to provide for the safety of the Good Friday Walk participants—including Cummings—by taking affirmative steps to provide for the safety of the marchers by controlling traffic on Broad Street. The plaintiff cites to Izen v. Winoker, 589 A.2d 824, 828 (R.I. 1991), in support of the contention that once defendants assumed a duty by controlling traffic for the safety of all the walkers, defendants were then responsible for carrying out that duty with reasonable care.', 'In Izen, we acknowledged that “one who assumes a duty to perform an act must do so with reasonable care whether or not that person had an obligation to perform the act or repairs prior to assuming the duty.” Izen, 589 A.2d at 828 (citing Therrien v. First National Stores, Inc., 63 R.I. 44, 51, 6 A.2d 731, 734 (1939)). More recently, in Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1259-60, we', '- 10 - reaffirmed this principle, and specifically refused to adopt the more “relaxed” standard set forth in § 324A of the Restatement (Second) Torts (1965).7 In so doing, we explained that the determination of whether or not a party voluntarily assumed a duty should continue to be reviewed “through the lens of our existing case law.” Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1260.', 'Furthermore, even if a duty purportedly arose when O’Connell took it upon herself to stop the traffic—a duty which we hold did not arise—it was extinguished when the walkers safely crossed Broad Street and traffic resumed. Additionally, because Cummings flatly and unequivocally rejected all offers of assistance, no duty exists under any circumstance in this case.', 'We also reject plaintiff’s argument that defendants exerted control over Brown’s tractor trailer when O’Connell stopped traffic and then waved it forward. The record reflects that Cummings was slowly descending the church steps and nowhere near the street when O’Connell waved traffic on and returned to the sidewalk. Brown’s tractor trailer already was stopped and awaiting an opportunity to turn left onto Sacred Heart Avenue when Cummings stepped off the curb and entered the street; Cummings was struck after she had partially crossed Broad Street. Any purported control defendants had over the tractor trailer clearly ended when O’Connell waved traffic on and traffic resumed. 7', 'The Restatement (Second) Torts § 324A at 142 (1965), which we decline to adopt in the context of this appeal, provides:', '“One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to', 'another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third', 'person or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm', 'resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if', '“(a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of', 'such harm, or', '“(b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the', 'third person, or', '“(c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the', 'third person upon the undertaking.”', '- 11 -', 'Accordingly, the arguments advanced by the plaintiff do not create questions of fact for the jury as the plaintiff contends, as it is well settled that in the absence of a legal duty, the plaintiff’s claims must fail as a matter of law. Ouch v. Khea, 963 A.2d 630, 633 (R.I. 2009) (“Only when a party properly overcomes the duty hurdle in a negligence action is he or she entitled to a factual determination on each of the remaining elements: breach, causation, and damages.”) (citing Selwyn v. Ward, 879 A.2d 882, 886 (R.I. 2005)); see also Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1252 (“Even in the face of tragic consequences, liability for alleged negligent conduct cannot attach to a defendant absent a recognized duty of care.”).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Furthermore, because we conclude that, as a matter of law, there was no cognizable duty of care owed by the defendants in this case, we need not address that portion of the plaintiff’s appeal pertaining to the trial justice’s conditional grant of a new trial.

After carefully considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'It is undisputed that, on the evening of August 6, 2008, the complaining witness, Lisa, visited defendant’s home, where some kind of sexual encounter between the fifteen-year-old Lisa and the forty-two-year-old defendant took place. 2 Beyond these basic facts, however, 1', 'Although interlocutory, the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable. State v. Casas, 792 A.2d 737, 739 (R.I. 2002). 2', 'Given the complaining witness’s young age at the time of the incident, we have given her a pseudonym to protect her privacy.', '-1- defendant’s and Lisa’s accounts of that evening diverge significantly.', 'In particular, the discrepancy that ultimately gave rise to this appeal concerned Lisa’s motivation for visiting defendant’s home that evening.', 'On August 7, 2008, the day after the incident, Lisa told an officer of the East Providence Police Department that she went to defendant’s house on the evening of the incident to inquire if Devina Rolle, 3 defendant’s daughter, was home. In her statement to the police, Lisa explained that she had “been friends with Devina since the both of [them] attended middle school together.” She further stated that “Devina lives on Anthony St[reet] * * * in a white house.” According to Lisa’s statement, on the evening of the incident, defendant invited her into his home and then attempted to have sex with her.', 'On August 15, 2008, defendant also made a statement to the East Providence police, in which he confirmed that Lisa had visited his home and admitted to touching Lisa on her hip, buttocks, and breasts. The defendant claimed, however, that Lisa came to his house looking for a sexual adventure. He stated that she told him that “she was eighteen years old and that she wanted to have some fun. She told me that she wanted to fool around.” On November 18, 2008, the state filed an information charging defendant with one count of second-degree sexual assault. 4', 'Immediately before the case opened to a jury on the morning of Tuesday, June 7, 2011, defense counsel made two motions concerning a new statement allegedly made by Lisa. Defense counsel explained to the trial justice that, based upon the discovery materials that the state had previously provided, counsel had expected Lisa to testify that she went to defendant’s house on 3', 'To avoid confusion, we refer to Ms. Rolle by her first name. We intend no disrespect. 4', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4, a person is guilty of second-degree sexual assault if he or she uses force or coercion to engage in sexual contact with another person.', '-2- August 6, 2008 to visit her friend Devina, who she believed resided with defendant.', 'In anticipation of this testimony, defense counsel had caused Devina to be flown in from her current residence in the state of Georgia to testify at trial that she had not resided in Rhode Island since 2007 and that she and Lisa had never been friends. Defense counsel then learned during a discussion that took place in chambers on the previous morning that Lisa was now expected to testify that she went to defendant’s house on the evening of the incident because she had heard that Devina was visiting from out of town. Defense counsel requested that the new statement be excluded or that the state provide her with additional information about the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s decision to alter her statement. Specifically, counsel asked the prosecutor to disclose when he had learned that Lisa was changing her statement; who was present when the new statement was made; and who and/or what had prompted the change.', 'In response to defense counsel’s motions, the prosecutor informed the trial justice that he and a victims’ services advocate had met with Lisa on Friday, June 3, 2011 at the Attorney General’s offices. The prosecutor explained that he was only recently assigned to the case. After the prosecutor concluded his response, defense counsel requested that the prosecutor also disclose when and from whom Lisa had allegedly heard that Devina was visiting from out of town. The prosecutor did not offer any additional information at that time. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion to exclude the new statement but reserved ruling on the request for supplemental discovery.', 'When the trial commenced, the state presented Lisa as its first witness. During direct examination, the prosecutor questioned Lisa about why she went to defendant’s home on the night of the incident. Lisa explained that she had “heard that Devina was in town so [she] decided to see if [Devina] was there and say hi.” She could not remember who informed her that', '-3- Devina was visiting from out of town but averred that she was aware in 2008 that Devina was living in Georgia.', 'Thereafter, on cross-examination, defense counsel showed Lisa a copy of her statement from August 7, 2008 and pointed out that nowhere in the statement did it indicate that she had heard that Devina was visiting from out of town. Lisa answered, “I told the police that. They probably didn’t write it down[.]”', 'At one point during cross-examination, the court recessed and defense counsel renewed her earlier motion for supplemental discovery. Defense counsel argued that, in order for her to effectively cross-examine Lisa, the state needed to disclose all of the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s new statement, including everyone who was present at the meeting, if there were any notes from the meeting, and if Devina’s testimony was discussed. The trial justice denied the motion, reasoning that the information that the state had provided earlier that morning was sufficient. After the jury returned, cross-examination concluded and the state completed redirect examination of Lisa.', 'When recross-examination began, defense counsel asked Lisa to review a portion of her statement from August 7, 2008. Lisa responded, “Before I read this, we revised this at my attorney’s office. We went over it and we highlighted the parts that weren’t accurate and I put in the rest of the information.” Lisa then revealed that her father had also been present during her meeting with the prosecutor on Friday, June 3. Lisa indicated that her father had made some handwritten additions to her statement. Defense counsel asked Lisa if the prosecutor had spoken with her on Friday about Devina’s expected testimony. Lisa explained that, during the meeting, she had spoken on the telephone with another prosecutor who had previously worked on her case. According to Lisa, the other prosecutor had informed her that Devina would be coming', '-4- from Georgia to Rhode Island to testify. She admitted that the other prosecutor specifically questioned her about why she went to defendant’s house on August 6, 2008 if Devina had already moved to Georgia at that time. Lisa insisted, however, that the Friday meeting was not the first time that she had mentioned hearing that Devina was visiting from out of town. She maintained that she had given this information to the police when she first met with them the day after the incident.', 'The trial justice then allowed the prosecutor to conduct further redirect examination, during which the prosecutor had the following exchange with Lisa:', '“[Prosecutor]: * * * you made—actually, you didn’t make the', 'marks on the statement, right, your father did?', '“[Lisa]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: All right. And I left the room?', '“[Lisa]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: And I said, ‘Read this over, tell me if you got any', 'changes’; right?', '“[Lisa]: Correct.', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Judge, leading.', '“The Court: Sustained.', '“[Prosecutor]: I’m just trying to—okay.', 'If I could have this', 'marked for identification, please.” At that point, the prosecutor produced a highlighted and annotated copy of Lisa’s August 7, 2008 statement, prompting defense counsel to request a sidebar.', 'At the sidebar, defense counsel told the trial justice that she had never seen the document that the prosecutor was attempting to introduce. She emphasized that the information that the prosecutor was now using to lead the witness on re-redirect examination was exactly the kind of', '-5- information she had repeatedly asked him to disclose in her requests for supplemental discovery. In response, the prosecutor asserted that the document was the same statement that Lisa had given to the police on August 7, 2008 but with some inconsequential additions. He explained that he was “concerned about * * * the impression that I am hiding something in front of this jury. Now, what I would like to do is move this statement as a full exhibit because I have * * * absolutely nothing to hide.”', 'The trial justice allowed the document to be marked for identification but refused to allow the document to be admitted as a full exhibit. After the sidebar, the state presented one more witness before resting.', 'When the trial continued the following morning, defendant moved for a mistrial. In ruling on defendant’s motion, the trial justice found that the prosecutor’s failure to turn over the revised statement to defense counsel was a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice then went on to consider whether the discovery violation required him to grant a mistrial. According to the trial justice, the undisclosed information was central to defendant’s case since its disclosure likely would have prompted defense counsel to adopt a different trial strategy. He emphasized that had the state been more forthcoming when defendant first requested the information, the nondisclosure could have been rectified by granting a continuance. The trial justice ultimately concluded that the only available remedy at that point in the proceedings was to declare a mistrial. Accordingly, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for a mistrial.', 'The defendant thereafter moved to dismiss the sexual-assault charge on double jeopardy grounds. At a hearing on defendant’s motion on August 5, 2011, defense counsel argued that the prosecutor’s attempt to submit the revised version of Lisa’s statement into evidence was a deliberate effort to goad defendant into moving to pass the case. She emphasized that she had', '-6- repeatedly requested that the prosecutor disclose the circumstances under which Lisa changed her statement at the June 3 meeting. It was only after Lisa had unexpectedly revealed some of those circumstances on recross-examination that the prosecutor produced the revised statement. According to defense counsel, the momentum of the trial had swung in defendant’s favor after recross-examination because the jury had begun to suspect that Lisa had altered her statement after learning of Devina’s expected testimony.', 'Defense counsel suggested that, as an experienced attorney for the state, the prosecutor knew that producing the revised statement could save his unraveling case by prompting defendant to request a mistrial.', 'In response, the prosecutor insisted that he did not turn over the revised statement because he did not believe the statement contained any “significant impeachment evidence.” According to the prosecutor, the granting of the mistrial did not provide him with any tactical advantage since he had successfully completed his case-in-chief.', 'In a bench decision rendered that same day, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss. He explained that a mistrial granted at defendant’s behest will only bar a retrial if the prosecutor engaged in extreme misconduct intended to goad defendant into moving to pass the case. The trial justice ultimately concluded that the prosecutor in Rolle’s case did not have the specific intent to provoke Rolle into requesting a mistrial. In reaching this conclusion, the trial justice rejected defense counsel’s suggestion that the prosecutor had attempted to abort an unraveling case. He reasoned that the prosecutor was “more overzealous than Machiavellian,” since the withholding of the revised statement appeared to be no more than a good-faith error in judgment. 5 An order denying defendant’s motion to dismiss entered on June 12, 2012. 5', 'The trial justice ordered the Attorney General’s office to reimburse the Public Defender’s office for the cost of flying Devina Rolle from Georgia to Rhode Island to testify at trial.', '-7-', 'The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on August 18, 2011. 6 On September 24, 2013, defendant filed a motion to hold this appeal in abeyance because state’s exhibit No. 5 for identification, Lisa’s revised statement, had been irretrievably lost. The defendant argued that, without a copy of the revised statement, retrial would be impossible because he would be unable to adequately cross-examine his accuser. He therefore requested that this Court remand the matter for the limited purpose of allowing him to file another motion to dismiss in Superior Court. In an order entered on November 14, 2013, this Court denied Rolle’s motion.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In instances “where a defendant has moved for a mistrial and asserts on appeal that double jeopardy bars his retrial because of prosecutorial goading, we defer to the trial court’s findings of fact.” State v. O’Connor, 936 A.2d 216, 220 (R.I. 2007). “Whether prosecutorial misconduct was intended to goad the defendant into seeking a mistrial is a question of fact for the trial [justice] to decide.” State v. Hull, 754 A.2d 84, 87 (R.I. 2000). On appeal, we “will not disturb the trial [justice]’s finding on that factual issue if it is supported by competent evidence.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 220.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'At the threshold, we address defendant’s suggestion that we need not reach the merits of this appeal. The defendant argues that, even if we conclude that double jeopardy does not preclude retrial, the loss of state’s exhibit No. 5 for identification makes retrial impossible. 6', 'Even though a final order did not enter until nearly ten months after defendant filed his notice of appeal, we consider defendant’s premature notice of appeal timely. See Curtis v. State, 996 A.2d 601, 603 n.3 (R.I. 2010) (“premature notice of appeal [is] timely as long as a final judgment is entered thereafter”).', '-8- According to defendant, his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine his accuser will be compromised if he must retry the case without a copy of the revised statement. At this time, we are not convinced that retrial is impossible. We hold out hope that the exhibit may yet be located. In the event it is not, the possibility of a retrial in its absence is a question more appropriately answered, in the first instance, by the trial justice. We will therefore go on to address whether double jeopardy prohibits retrying defendant on the sexual-assault charge.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge on double jeopardy grounds. In particular, he ascribes error to the trial justice’s conclusion that the prosecutor lacked the specific intent to provoke a mistrial.', 'The prohibitions on double jeopardy contained in the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions ordinarily do not prevent the retrial of a criminal defendant when a mistrial has been granted at the defendant’s behest. 7 State v. Casas, 792 A.2d 737, 739 (R.I. 2002). There is an exception, however, for instances where a prosecutor has engaged in extreme misconduct intended to provoke the defendant into moving to pass the case. Id. This exception is a narrow one. See State v. Beltre, 764 A.2d 190, 191 (R.I. 2000) (mem.). We have steadfastly adhered to the rule announced in Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 676 (1982), that a second trial is not forbidden unless the prosecutor’s conduct was specifically intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial. Casas, 792 A.2d at 739. “Mere prosecutorial error, therefore, although it may incite a mistrial, will not preclude retrial.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 222. In rejecting any attempt to broaden this exception, we have explained that the Kennedy rule strikes “a careful balance between the right of a defendant to obtain a completion of his trial by the first tribunal assembled * * * and the societal interest in apprehending and punishing those who are guilty of 7', 'Article 1, section 7 of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit a defendant from twice being put in jeopardy for the same offense.', '-9- serious crimes.” State v. Diaz, 521 A.2d 129, 133 (R.I. 1987); see Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; State v. McIntyre, 671 A.2d 806, 807 (R.I. 1996).', 'To infer the existence or nonexistence of intentional goading, the trial justice examines the objective facts and circumstances surrounding the prosecutor’s misconduct. O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 223 n.6. Some of those relevant facts and circumstances include the timing of the misconduct, the experience of the prosecutor, and whether there was a legitimate reason for the misconduct. See, e.g., Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; Hull, 754 A.2d at 87; McIntyre, 671 A.2d at 807.', 'According to defendant, the objective facts and circumstances in this case compel the conclusion that the prosecutor’s production of the revised statement was intended to provoke a mistrial. He relies heavily upon the prosecutor’s experience and the timing of the misconduct, arguing that the prosecutor did not reveal the revised statement until after his case had begun to unravel.', 'The defendant is correct that one of the evils that the Kennedy rule seeks to guard against is “an unscrupulous prosecutor, faced with a rapidly derailing trial, conceivably * * * seek[ing] a premature end of the proceedings in hope of returning another day.” Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; see also State v. Perez, 605 A.2d 1305, 1309 (R.I. 1992) (Retrial is prohibited when a prosecutor has engaged in “bad-faith conduct designed to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict the defendant.”) (quoting State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1345 (R.I. 1986)). After carefully reviewing the record, however, we agree with the trial justice’s conclusion that no such evil was present in this case.', 'Here, the trial justice specifically took into consideration the prosecutor’s experience and the fact that the prosecutor’s attempt to introduce the revised statement came deep into the state’s case. Notwithstanding these facts, he concluded that “it does not follow that [the prosecutor’s]', '- 10 - misconduct was [the] voluntary derailing of a trial going badly.” In reaching this conclusion, the trial justice acknowledged that “cross-examination * * * might have been considered a setback for the prosecution” but indicated that he “was not convinced that the [s]tate was by any means on the verge of losing this case.”', 'Although defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s finding that the prosecutor’s case was not progressing badly, we conclude that this finding is amply supported by competent evidence of record. In finding that the state was not on the brink of losing the case, the trial justice characterized Lisa as a convincing and consistent witness for the state. Since we are “relegated to reading from a ‘lifeless record,’ [we] justifiably defer to trial justices who experience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerrero, 996 A.2d 86, 90 (R.I. 2010)). At trial, Lisa repeatedly insisted that when she made her initial statement to the police, she mentioned hearing that Devina was visiting from out of town and speculated that the police officer had accidentally omitted that fact from the typed statement. We cannot fault the trial justice for crediting this testimony.', 'The defendant also quarrels with the trial justice’s conclusion that the prosecutor’s misconduct was the result of a good-faith error in judgment. He asserts that the prosecutor’s repeated failure to disclose the circumstances of the June 3 meeting is highly suggestive of bad faith. Again, our review of the record convinces us that the trial justice appropriately considered this factor and made a well-supported finding.', 'The trial justice admonished the prosecutor for not being more forthcoming about the June 3 meeting and warned that he would not tolerate “trial[] by ambush.” He ultimately found, however, that the prosecutor’s withholding of the revised statement was an error of judgment.', '- 11 - The prosecutor explained that he believed—albeit erroneously—that he was not obligated under Rule 16 to turn over the revised statement to defense counsel because he deemed the changes to the statement to be largely inconsequential. If the prosecutor did not believe that his initial decision to withhold the document was a discovery violation, it is unlikely that he would believe that his later decision to produce the document would be grounds for a mistrial. In fact, the prosecutor offered a legitimate explanation for producing the statement. When he submitted the document into evidence, he explained that he wished to correct any impression the jurors might have that he was concealing the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s changed statement. We are cognizant of the fact that the prosecutor’s own lack of openness created the unfavorable impression that he was attempting to dispel. Nonetheless, it appears that the prosecutor was not seeking a more favorable opportunity to try his case in front of a new jury, but rather was seeking to redeem himself in the eyes of the original jurors. The trial justice correctly concluded that such overzealousness was grounds for a mistrial but would not preclude retrial.', 'After considering all of the defendant’s arguments, we are satisfied that the trial justice performed a balanced and conscientious analysis of the objective facts and circumstances in this case. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence of record to support the trial justice’s finding that those objective facts did not give rise to an inference of intentional goading. Accordingly, we uphold the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion to dismiss the charge.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

82,Donna Banville : v. : Peter Brennan et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendants, Peter and Joyce Brennan, appeal from a judgment entered by the Superior Court in favor of the plaintiff, Donna Banville, in this boundary dispute between neighbors. On appeal, the Brennans argue that the trial justice erred in finding that the doctrine of acquiescence applied to establish the dividing line between the two lots. The Brennans also argue that the trial justice erred in awarding damages to Banville based on the diminution in the fair market value of her real property as a result of the alleged encroachment by the Brennans. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff, Donna Banville, owns real estate at 1692 Eagleville Road in Tiverton, Rhode Island, which is designated as Block 108, Card 47C on the Tiverton Tax Assessor’s map. Banville has resided on the property since 1984 when the lot was created by the subdivision of a', '-1- larger lot. This larger lot was then owned by John and Monika Ferreira, who intended to divide it into two lots of approximately equal size. 1', 'The other lot created out of the subdivision of the larger one is designated as Block 108, Card 47E on the Tiverton Tax Assessor’s map and has the address of 1710 Eagleville Road. This lot currently belongs to the Brennans. In 1984, the owner of the so-called Brennan lot was Peter Edes. Edes placed a trailer and constructed a shed on the lot, both of which appeared to respect the town plat map boundaries as the boundary between the Banville lot and the Brennan lot. In 2003, Edes transferred the lot to Kevin and Gail Goncalo. The Goncalos transferred the lot to the Brennans on November 7, 2006.', 'At trial, Banville testified that, from 1984 on, she observed the Town plat map boundaries with respect to ownership and maintenance of her property, which was roughly demarcated on the easterly side by a row of trees. Banville further testified that in 2005 she put up an electric fence that largely ran along the line of trees in order to keep her horses contained.', 'The instant dispute between the Brennans and Banville began on January 5, 2007, when Peter Brennan introduced himself to Banville as the new owner of the neighboring property and informed her that he was going to get his lot surveyed in order to construct a building on it. On January 8, 2007, Mr. Brennan informed Banville that his surveyor had encountered some problems because of the electric fence. Banville agreed to turn off the electricity while the Brennans’ surveyor was working. The Brennans’ surveyor, Mr. Steven Murgo, proceeded to conduct a survey of the two lots (the Murgo survey). On January 12, 2007, Banville returned home to find survey markers running through her front yard, a portion of her trailer, her pool, her backyard, and into her horse corral. There was also spray paint running along her trailer’s 1', 'The record indicates that they believed that the larger lot contained approximately seven acres; the lot, in fact, only contained around three and a half acres.', '-2- foundation, indicating that, according to the Murgo survey, part of her trailer and her horse corral were on the Brennan lot.', 'On January 14, 2007, Mr. Brennan, relying on the Murgo survey, informed Banville that her trailer was partially encroaching on his property and preventing him from constructing his building. Banville told Mr. Brennan that she disagreed with this survey and that she wanted to hire her own surveyor in order to determine the boundaries.', 'On January 16, 2007, Mr. Brennan applied for a building permit from the Tiverton building inspector to construct a foundation on his lot.', 'On January 18, 2007, Banville returned home to find that her electric fence had been moved to be consistent with the Murgo survey stakes, thus trapping her horses into a small area. Banville called the Tiverton Police Department, which came to the scene and submitted an incident report. The police contacted Mr. Brennan and informed him that he could not move Banville’s property without her express permission as to whether and where her property might be moved. Mr. Brennan apologized to Banville, and Banville again informed Mr. Brennan that she wanted to have her own survey conducted to determine the boundary line. 2', 'Mr. Brennan and Banville had further conversations concerning the boundary line, with Mr. Brennan telling Banville that he “wanted to be a good neighbor,” but that he needed to get his building constructed. Sometime on or around January 26, 2007, Banville consented to move her trailer and her dog kennel so that they were no longer over the Murgo survey line. At some point thereafter, Mr. Brennan had a row of large boulders placed along the Murgo-surveyed boundary between the two lots. 2', 'At trial, Mr. Brennan averred that he did not recall being told at that time that Banville would be having her own survey conducted.', '-3-', 'Banville hired Donald J. Medeiros, a registered land surveyor, to survey the properties. On January 31, 2007, Banville sent a certified letter to the Tiverton building inspector and to the Brennans, informing them that she had hired Mr. Medeiros to survey the land. Mr. Brennan testified, however, that he never received the letter. 3 On February 8, 2007, Mr. Medeiros first visited the properties to conduct his survey (the Medeiros survey). At that time, he informed Mr. Brennan that he had been hired by Banville to survey the two lots and determine the disputed boundary line. The Medeiros survey ultimately concluded that the boundary line between the two lots was located, in part, approximately in line with the row of trees which Banville had previously observed as the boundary. Significantly, however, while the Brennans’ building does not extend past the row of trees, it does extend beyond the boundary line established by the Medeiros survey by an estimated thirteen feet at one corner.', 'On March 9, 2007, Mr. Brennan applied for a building permit for a steel commercial building to house his equipment for his excavating business. 4 The Tiverton building inspector issued a certificate of use and occupancy for the building on the Brennan lot on November 14, 2007.', 'Banville filed the instant suit on May 1, 2008, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 5 A nonjury trial was held in the Newport County Superior Court on April 25, 26, and 27, 2011.', 'At trial, two of Banville’s longtime neighbors testified on her behalf.

They asserted that Mr. Brennan informed them that he planned to proceed with construction anyway and that he believed the Murgo survey was correct. Mr. Brennan disputed this testimony.', 'Mr. Medeiros also testified at trial, explaining at some length the process by which he had conducted his survey and arrived at his conclusion concerning the location of the boundary line.', 'He testified that each of the two lots—the Banville lot and the Brennan lot—were approximately one-and-one-half acres in area. Mr. Medeiros testified that he spoke to Monika Ferreira, one of the original owners, who told him that the original surveyor had placed survey stakes along the dividing line between the two lots at the time of the subdivision.', 'Nathan Godfrey, a real-estate appraisal expert, testified as an expert witness for plaintiff as to the fair market value of the Banville lot before the encroachment of the Brennan building and the diminution in value to the lot as a result of the encroachment. He asserted that the encroachment would result in an approximately 15 percent depreciation in value, resulting in a loss of $30,000.', 'Richard Lipsitz, a licensed surveyor, testified as an expert witness for defendants. He agreed with the Medeiros survey as to the perimeter property lines of the entire parcel. He disagreed, however, with the Medeiros survey as to the location of the boundary line between the two lots. According to Mr. Lipsitz, the Medeiros survey failed to give the proper weight to the existing “monuments” on the land in order to locate the boundary line and also did not follow the original subdivision plan. Lipsitz asserted that he believed the correct boundary line should end with Mr. Brennan’s building being entirely on the Brennan lot and the corner of Banville’s trailer encroaching onto the Brennan lot.', '-5-', 'The trial also included a viewing of the properties. The trial justice issued a bench decision on September 22, 2011. The trial justice made extensive findings of fact, determining that he found the testimony of Banville’s neighbors to be credible with regard to Banville’s continued use of her property up to the row of trees, approximately where the Medeiros survey placed the boundary. He concluded that Mr. Medeiros had conducted a thorough survey with extensive research into the record titles of the properties before arriving at his conclusions. Accordingly, the trial justice found that the Medeiros survey was correct in the placement of the boundary line. He did not accept Mr. Lipsitz’s testimony as to the location of the boundary line, noting that Mr. Lipsitz’s conclusions “conveniently result[ed] in a boundary line between the two properties with Mr. Brennan’s building being located entirely on his property * * *.” The trial justice also stated that the Murgo survey was incorrect as to the location of the boundary line, commenting that it was “unfortunate[]” for the Brennans that they had relied on it, despite the warnings from Banville and other longtime residents of the neighborhood. The trial justice further found that Banville had testified credibly as to how the Brennans’ encroachment on her property had adversely affected her use and enjoyment of her property. He concluded that “Ms. Banville has proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the Medeiros survey is accurate and that she has record title, clear title to her lot as established, and the boundaries of that lot as established, by the Medeiros survey.”', 'The trial justice went on to address Banville’s adverse possession and acquiescence claims. The trial justice found that Banville had openly and notoriously occupied the disputed area of land from 1984 to 2007, in excess of the statutory period required for adverse possession. He also concluded that the boundary line between the two lots had been established by the doctrine of acquiescence as a result of the row of trees having been respected as the boundary', '-6- line between the two lots by plaintiff and by both predecessors in title to the Brennans. Accordingly, the trial justice granted injunctive relief to plaintiff, permanently enjoining the Brennans from trespassing on the Banville lot and ordering the removal of the boulders and the portion of the Brennans’ building that encroached on the Banville lot. 6', 'He also awarded damages to Banville in the amount of $30,000 as the amount of the diminution in the fair market value of the Banville lot as a result of the encroachment.', 'Judgment was entered for plaintiff on October 21, 2011.

According to defendants, the doctrine of acquiescence mandates that the tree line mark the boundary between the properties and that the Brennans’ building is not encroaching on the Banville lot because it does not extend beyond the tree line.', 'We begin by noting that we are satisfied that the trial justice’s conclusions with regard to the doctrine of acquiescence were essentially dicta and unnecessary to support judgment for plaintiff in this matter. The trial justice had previously found that plaintiff had proved that the Medeiros survey line constituted the actual boundary between the two lots; he addressed the theories of adverse possession and acquiescence only as alternative grounds for his decision. The trial justice was entitled to conclude from the evidence established at trial the location of the boundary line.', 'On reviewing the record, we are convinced that the trial justice neither', '-8- overlooked nor misconceived any material evidence in reaching his conclusion. Accordingly, we cannot disturb his decision on appeal.', 'To the extent that defendants argue that the “tree line” boundary established by the doctrine of acquiescence trumps the Medeiros survey line which the trial justice found to be the actual boundary, however, we will address defendants’ argument. The doctrine of acquiescence permits a claimant to “gain title to a defendant’s property * * * despite the fact that [the] defendant had record title.” DelSesto v. Lewis, 754 A.2d 91, 95 (R.I. 2000) (quoting Locke v. O’Brien, 610 A.2d 552, 555 (R.I. 1992)). Under the doctrine of acquiescence, “adjoining landowners are ‘precluded from denying a boundary line recognized by both owners for a length of time equal to that prescribed by the statute of limitations barring a right of reentry.’” Acampora v. Pearson, 899 A.2d 459, 464 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Locke, 610 A.2d at 556). “The party claiming ownership by acquiescence must show ‘that a boundary marker existed and that the parties recognized that boundary for a period * * * [of] ten years.’” DeCosta v.

The trial justice found that the evidence established that, from 1984 until 2007, plaintiff and the previous owners of the Brennan lot observed the line of trees running roughly along the Medeiros survey line as the dividing line between the two lots. The trial justice concluded that the tree line was a sufficiently obvious demarcation of a boundary line and that the Brennans’ predecessors in title were on notice that the tree line was the boundary line. Accordingly, the trial justice found that the doctrine of acquiescence applied to establish the boundary line between the lots at the tree line. The trial justice explicitly clarified in denying the motion for a stay that his “use of the term ‘tree line’ in the [c]ourt’s decision was meant to indicate the boundary line as established by the Medeiros survey.”', 'While we have some reservations as to whether a naturally-occurring tree line may, under other circumstances, constitute a sufficiently obvious boundary so as to fall within the reach of the doctrine of acquiescence, 7 we cannot conclude that the trial justice erred in his findings.

Having had the benefit of hearing the testimony of the witnesses and viewing the property, the trial justice’s conclusion as to the location of the boundary line is entitled to deference.', 'Because we conclude that the trial justice’s decision holding that the Medeiros survey line constituted the boundary line between the two lots was neither clearly erroneous nor did it fail to do substantial justice between the parties, we cannot, and will not, disturb the trial justice’s decision on appeal.', 'B', 'The Trial Justice’s Award of Damages', 'The defendants also argue that the trial justice erred in awarding damages to Banville based on the diminution in value of her property. According to defendants, Banville should not be entitled to damages because any award for diminution in value assumes that the encroachment would be permanent. Once the encroachments are removed, defendants assert, Banville would not suffer any diminution in value of her property.', 'It is well settled that our review of a trial justice’s findings on damages is deferential.

The trial justice cited plaintiff’s testimony that she has been required to move her pen for her animals, as well as having had her view negatively affected. The trial justice further accepted the credible testimony of Mr. Godfrey, plaintiff’s real-estate expert, as to the diminution of the fair market value of Banville’s property as a result of the encroachment. The trial justice therefore awarded damages to Banville in the amount of the diminution in the fair market value of her land.', 'We are of the opinion that the evidence in the record was more than sufficient to support the trial justice’s award of monetary damages to plaintiff in addition to injunctive relief. While we acknowledge that the general rule is that diminution in value is an appropriate measure of damages only when the damage to real property is permanent, we conclude that the circumstances of this case justify an award for damages to plaintiff’s property based on that rule. The cost of repair for temporary damage to his or her real property is generally awarded to the plaintiff as the person who would otherwise be responsible for the cost of correcting the damage caused by the defendant. That is not the situation here, as the plaintiff would not—indeed, could not—be responsible for the cost of removing the encroachment of the Brennans’ building from her lot. Consequently, we conclude that the cost of restoration as measured by the cost of removing the encroachment is not an appropriate measure of damages in this case nor would it', '- 12 - adequately compensate Banville for the injury she has suffered as a result of defendants’ behavior.

We note that defendants also painted markers onto plaintiff’s home, placed a stone wall on her property, and significantly disrupted plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her property over a period of at least five years. The parties also do not dispute that plaintiff has been required to move her fence and her dog kennel to accommodate defendants’ encroachment. In addition, plaintiff mentioned and defendants conceded at oral argument that at least a portion of the tree line has been destroyed as a result of defendants’ encroachment. We are satisfied that the nature and extent of the various and ongoing harms plaintiff suffered over such a substantial period of time support an award of damages for diminution in value.', 'We also note that the trial justice observed that the Brennans’ behavior over the course of this dispute has been less than admirable. The Brennans persisted in their conduct even after they had been informed by more than one of the longtime residents of the neighborhood that they were placing unsightly encroachments on plaintiff’s property. 8', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice was well within the bounds of his discretion in awarding the plaintiff damages for the diminution in the fair market value of her land. 8', 'The trial justice, after viewing the property, specifically described the boulders as an “eyesore.”', '- 13 - Furthermore, we cannot say that measuring damages according to the diminution in value was inconsistent with the loss of the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her property, which she has suffered for a significant period of time.', 'Indeed, in view of the defendants’ willful encroachment, in the face of ample notice that there was a significant problem with the Murgo survey, and the real and lasting harm to the plaintiff’s property as a result of the defendants’ behavior, we agree with the trial justice that the award of $30,000 is not excessive nor does it otherwise shock the conscience of this Court.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

The plaintiffs responded with a lengthy pleading in opposition to defendants’ motion. The Superior Court justice granted the motion to dismiss, concluding that plaintiffs did not have standing to seek relief based on the assignment because they were neither an assignor nor an assignee of the assignment. Alternatively, he also concluded that, even if plaintiffs did have standing, they had “failed to allege facts in their Complaint which ‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level,’” quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). The Superior Court justice further stated that Aurora properly was the mortgagee prior to the commencement of foreclosure proceedings and that the identity of the note holder was irrelevant.', 'Standard of Review', 'The articulation of the standard of review on a motion to dismiss was raised as an issue in this case. Under this Court’s traditional explication of the standard, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss should be granted only “when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.” Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 149-50 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Ellis v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 586 A.2d 1055, 1057 (R.I. 1991)); see also McKenna v.

In undertaking this review, we are “confined to the four corners of the complaint and must assume all allegations are true, resolving any doubts in plaintiff’s favor.” Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278.', 'Generally, this Court looks to Federal jurisprudence for guidance or interpretation of Rule 12(b). See Hall v. Kuzenka, 843 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 2004) (“[W]here the Federal rule and our state rule are substantially similar, we will look to the Federal courts for guidance or interpretation of our own rule.” Quoting Heal v. Heal, 762 A.2d 463, 466-67 (R.I. 2000)). Additionally, we have noted that “Rhode Island Rule 12(b) is nearly identical to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” Hall, 843 A.2d at 476-77. In recent years, however, the Federal courts have significantly altered their interpretation of the standard of review applicable to a motion to dismiss, and the Superior Court justice in this case relied on that interpretation. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Under this standard, “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” and a plaintiff must “nudge[] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570.5 “[T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Significantly, “the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint’s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686. “[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.” 5', 'In Twombly, the Supreme Court stated that the “no set of facts” language originating in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957)—and on which this Court’s articulation of the traditional Rhode Island standard is based—“has earned its retirement.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562, 563 (2007). Thus, it is clear that the new Federal standard cannot be blended with the traditional Rhode Island standard.', '-4- Id. at 679. “Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief * * * [is] a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”', 'Id.', '“Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.” Id. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'This Court has not yet addressed whether continued adherence to our traditional Rhode Island standard is appropriate or whether the new Federal guide of plausibility should be adopted. However, we are satisfied that this is not the case to answer such an important question because our decision under either articulation of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss standard would be the same. Accordingly, we leave the Twombly and Iqbal conundrum for another day.', 'Analysis', 'Standing', 'The Superior Court justice held that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage on their home.', 'Recently, this Court held that, in limited circumstances, “homeowners in Rhode Island have standing to challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.” Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., No. 2012-282-A., slip op. at 13 (R.I., filed Dec. 19, 2013). The plaintiffs in this case contest Aurora’s authority to foreclose, alleging that the mortgage was not validly assigned. In light of Mruk, we are satisfied that plaintiffs have standing to prosecute this claim.', 'The Motion to Dismiss', 'The Superior Court justice concluded that, even if plaintiffs had standing, their “allegations with respect to the invalidity of the assignment of the Mortgage interest are merely', '-5- ‘conclusory statements’ which are insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.” Before this Court, defendants contend that “the Superior Court utilized the Rhode Island pleading standard.” Although the Superior Court justice stated that “[p]laintiffs’ [c]omplaint cannot survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion even under the more forgiving pleading standard articulated in [Barrette v. Yakavonis, 966 A.2d 1231 (R.I. 2009) and Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144 (R.I. 2008)],” at the crucial points of the decision, the Superior Court justice employed Twombly and Iqbal. Regardless of which standard the decision rests upon, we conclude that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under both our traditional standard and the newer Federal standard.', 'Paragraph 12 of the complaint alleges: “On or about September 10, 2010, MERS attempted to assign this Mortgage to Aurora. * * * Theodore Schultz signed. Theodore Schultz had no authority to assign.” Thus, the plaintiffs have alleged that the one person who signed the mortgage assignment did not have the authority to do so. This allegation is buttressed by other allegations in the complaint. Paragraph 13 states that “Theodore Schultz was an employee of Aurora, not a Vice-President or Assistant Secretary of MERS.” Paragraph 17 alleges that “MERS did not order the assignment to Aurora.” Finally, paragraph 19 contends that “[n]o power of attorney from MERS to either Theodore Schultz or Aurora is recorded and referenced in the subject assignment.” These allegations, if proven, could establish that the mortgage was not validly assigned, and, therefore, Aurora did not have the authority to foreclose on the property. Accordingly, the complaint states a plausible claim upon which relief can be granted, and it is not “clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.” Palazzo, 944 A.2d at 149-50 (quoting Ellis, 586 A.2d at 1057); see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at', '-6- 678-80 (articulating plausibility standard).

84,State : v. : Raymond Clements. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. In the early morning hours of June 14, 2007, two young women were brutally murdered, and their bodies set on fire. Apparently, the women were the victims of their attackers’ decision not to succumb to the demands of one of them for money in exchange for silence about the attackers’ perpetration of insurance fraud. The defendant, Raymond Clements, was charged with two counts of murder, one count of conspiracy, and one count of arson arising out of the June 14, 2007 incident. Eventually, Clements was tried before a jury and convicted on all counts. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to three consecutive life sentences, one each for the murders of Heather Jesus and Amanda Sousa and another for the arson count, plus ten years for the conspiracy count, to be served concurrently with the final life sentence. After his conviction, the defendant timely appealed to this Court. On appeal, he argues that the trial justice erred by admitting evidence of a robbery committed on June 13, 2007,', '-1- the day before the murders; by failing to instruct the jury of the use it might make of that evidence; and by denying the defendant’s motion to pass the case. We have considered the parties’ written and oral arguments and thoroughly examined the record. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A fire on the third floor of an apartment building on Plainfield Street in Providence led police to the discovery of two charred bodies, one on top of the other. Although the bodies were severely damaged by fire, they were later identified as the remains of cousins Heather Jesus and Amanda Sousa. After an autopsy was conducted, the medical examiner determined that Sousa’s death was caused by multiple blunt- and sharp-force injuries. 1 The medical examiner counted dozens of sharp-force wounds to the head and torso of Sousa, including one wound that severed her windpipe.', 'Jesus’ violent death was determined to have been caused by sharp-force injuries and asphyxia as a result of neck and chest compression, and it was determined that her windpipe was similarly cut, with that injury having been inflicted after the bruising on her neck. Both deaths were deemed to have been homicides. The defendant, Raymond Clements, and Anthony Carter were later charged with the murders. 2 1', 'According to the medical examiner, a blunt-force injury is caused by an object that has no sharp edge and is not capable of making a cut, while a sharp-force injury is caused by an object that has a sharp edge and is capable of making a cut. 2', 'Carter was charged with and later pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Sousa, the first- degree murder of Jesus, the conspiracy to murder Sousa and Jesus, and first-degree arson.', '-2-', 'The defendant and Carter had been close friends since they met in approximately 1996 at the Rhode Island Training School, where they both were incarcerated for juvenile offenses. 3 The juvenile system apparently was not successful with the pair, as each “graduated” to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) as a result of criminal convictions. After Carter was released from prison on June 1, 2007, he and defendant resumed their close relationship, and they spent considerable time together. Carter spent his nights following his release from prison either at his grandmother’s home or at defendant’s home, where defendant lived with his wife and son. Carter’s sister Jessica, who had eloped from a group home, also stayed with defendant’s family in early June of 2007.', 'Anthony Carter, who testified on behalf of the state, said that he met Jesus and Sousa for the first time in the overnight hours of June 5 to 6, 2007, within days of his release from prison. He encountered Jesus for the first time when he and defendant patronized her workplace, the Sportsman’s Inn, a strip club in Providence. The pair made arrangements to see Jesus when she completed her work shift. Carter and Clements picked up Sousa at her house; the trio then traveled to Jesus’ apartment. Although Carter had just made Jesus’ acquaintance, defendant had known her for many years.', 'On June 8, 2007, Clements, Carter, and Sousa were involved in an accident while they were traveling in defendant’s car. The three abandoned the car, but Carter testified that, after the accident, he listened as defendant instructed his wife to report the car stolen on two separate occasions: once over the telephone immediately after the crash, and again after they returned to 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-56-33 provides: “The department of corrections shall maintain a school to be known as the training school for youth for the detention of children by order of the [F]amily [C]ourt and for the confinement, instruction, and reformation of children found delinquent or wayward by the [F]amily [C]ourt.”', '-3- Clements’s apartment. Now deprived of their only mode of transportation, Carter and defendant secured the agreement of Carter’s grandmother to rent a car for them.', 'According to Carter, on June 11 or 12, Sousa telephoned him with a threat that she would inform the police about the accident and false police report unless he and defendant paid her the sum of $500 every Friday. Because Carter and defendant were together at the time of this call, they discussed Sousa’s demand between themselves. Carter testified that he and defendant agreed that they would not pay and that they had “to take care of the situation.” When Sousa called again, Carter informed her that neither he nor defendant would meet her demand; she then repeated her threat, but she also agreed to talk to Carter and Clements. Carter testified that, after this second call, defendant said that “[t]hey got to go.” Carter understood that to mean that Sousa and Jesus should be killed. 4 Carter said that, although he agreed to the murders, he wanted to spend some time to plan the killings. The defendant, however, said that “it had to be done ASAP.” Carter testified that he was nervous about killing anyone, but he agreed to the scheme because “that [wa]s the type of relationship [he and defendant] had.”', 'Clements and Carter arrived at Jesus’ apartment in the final hours of June 13, 2007, retrieved gloves from the back of the station wagon that Carter’s grandmother had rented for them, and went inside. Carter testified that Clements was unwilling to kill Jesus because he had known her for a long time. Therefore, the pair agreed that Carter would kill Jesus, and Clements would kill Sousa. After the group smoked marijuana and socialized for a while, Clements and Sousa left the room, with Clements saying that he was going to repair a door in the kitchen. 4', 'Carter said that, although Jesus had never asked for any money, he and defendant decided that they had to kill both of the women. They reasoned that, if they killed only Sousa, then Jesus would know that they had been the perpetrators.', '-4- However, he also began ominously twirling his finger in a gesture that Carter understood to mean that it was time to put the plan to kill Jesus and Sousa into action.', 'A short time later, Carter grabbed Jesus and strangled her. After he had choked Jesus to death, Carter saw Sousa and defendant return from the kitchen, bloody and in the midst of a deadly struggle. Clements was, according to Carter’s testimony, wielding a railroad spike as a weapon. The struggle subsided temporarily while Sousa, on her knees, pleaded with Clements to stop; Carter said that, although defendant assured Sousa that he would call an ambulance and the police, he instead viciously kicked her in the head, which ended the fight. The defendant then instructed Carter to “cut her throat.” After Carter retrieved a knife and severed Jesus’ throat, defendant said that he had been referring to Sousa, not Jesus. The defendant then did the same thing to Sousa, using a different knife.', 'Clements and Carter attempted to conceal the evidence of their actions by cleaning the apartment and placing certain items into trash bags that they later threw into a dumpster in Pawtucket and burned. According to Carter, defendant instructed him to find some flammable material so that they could burn the bodies of Sousa and Jesus in an attempt to destroy evidence. Clothes, newspapers, and pillows were piled on the bodies, which were then doused with perfume and WD-40 and set alight. 5 The resulting fire led police to the apartment, where the bodies were discovered.', 'The duo retreated to defendant’s apartment, where Jessica Carter opened the door for them; she testified that she saw that her brother and defendant were covered in blood. At trial, Jessica Carter and Anthony Carter each testified that defendant told his wife that he and Anthony 5', 'A trace analyst at the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory determined that charred debris taken from the scene of the crime tested consistently with the presence of WD-40. WD-40 is an oil-based lubricant.', '-5- Carter had killed two women and that the men’s bloody clothes had to be put into a bag. 6 The defendant and Anthony Carter showered, and, after stopping by Carter’s grandmother’s home to retrieve some clothing, they drove to Florida. 7 The defendant’s stay in Florida was short-lived: he remained there for only about two weeks. The day after he returned to Rhode Island, defendant explained in detail to Jessica Carter, Anthony’s sister, what had occurred, a story that included Sousa’s demand for money following the car accident, the manner in which he and Anthony Carter had killed the women, and the fact that they set the women’s bodies on fire.', 'The Providence police, who were investigating the murders, reached defendant on the telephone while he was in Florida, asking him to come to the police station. During a telephone conversation on June 14, 2007, defendant informed a Providence detective that he was in Idaho on his way to California and that he had last seen Sousa and Jesus one week earlier. A different police officer received a call from defendant on June 20, 2007; during that call, defendant claimed to be in Idaho attending to a sick relative while he was actually in Florida with Carter. 8 During the latter conversation, defendant also informed the police that he had last seen the rental car in Massachusetts on June 12 or 13, after he quarreled with Carter. Significantly, Carter’s grandmother testified that during the time defendant was hiding in Florida, she was contacted by both defendant and his wife. Each requested that she persuade her grandson to tell police that he 6', 'The defendant’s wife invoked the spousal privilege and did not testify beyond answering the questions necessary to show that the privilege applied. 7', 'Later, in his statement to police, defendant said that he and Carter stopped at Carter’s grandmother’s house first and his own house second. In that statement, defendant also gave his reason for leaving Rhode Island in a rented car in the middle of the night for a two-week stay in Florida: he said that he left because he and his wife were not getting along and that Florida was the destination because he had an uncle who lived there. 8', 'According to the officer who spoke to defendant on June 14, defendant claimed that he was driving through Idaho on his way to California. Carter testified that he overheard defendant’s half of a conversation with police, during which defendant said that he was in Ohio on his way to California to see a sick uncle. There is no dispute that defendant was in Florida at the time.', '-6- and defendant were not together at the time that the murders were committed. On June 29, 2007, after his return from Florida, defendant voluntarily met with Providence police detectives. This time he admitted that he was with Carter on the night of the murders. In defendant’s statement to police, which was played for the jury during his trial, he claimed that, on the night of the murders, he waited downstairs on a porch while Carter was in Jesus’ apartment.', 'On appeal before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he admitted into evidence testimony about a robbery that he and Carter had committed the day before the murders, that the instruction on the use of that evidence was deficient, and that the trial justice further erred when he refused to declare a mistrial because of prejudicial remarks by the prosecutor during his closing argument.', 'II', 'Evidence of Robbery', 'During defendant’s trial, Carter, who was presented as a witness by the state, was allowed to testify that he and defendant had committed a robbery on June 13, 2007. 9 Before he admitted evidence about that robbery, the trial justice conducted a sidebar conference, during which he heard argument about whether such evidence was admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. During that conference, the state maintained that the evidence was necessary to avoid creating “a vacuum” in the minds of the jury about what Carter and Clements were doing during the day on June 13 and that such a vacuum “would naturally invite them to speculate what was going on.” The state also urged that the evidence should be admissible because defendant had been charged with conspiracy.', 'The defendant objected, relying on State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941 (R.I. 2008) (Pona I), and State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140 9', 'The defendant had pleaded nolo contendere to the charges arising out of the robbery.', '-7- (R.I. 2009). After listening to both sides, the trial justice said that he would allow the testimony because the robbery was “inextricably woven with the fabric of this story” and because it allowed the state “to establish the personal relationship between” defendant and Carter.', 'After admitting that he had pleaded guilty to several other robberies, Carter testified over defendant’s objection that he also had pleaded guilty to committing a robbery on June 13, 2007, and to conspiring with Clements to commit that robbery. Carter then testified as to the more recent additions to his impressive criminal record, including his pleas to the charges arising from the murders of Sousa and Jesus, as well as other charges arising out of robberies that he had committed after fleeing to Florida. The trial justice then instructed the jury as follows:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard an exposition', 'of [Carter’s] criminal record that he has pled guilty to various', 'charges, that he spent time in the training school from the time he', 'was 12-years old, and you have heard all of that under the rules of', 'evidence. That is allowed to go before you for one reason and one', 'reason only in a case like this. Any witness who appears in any', 'kind of case who has a criminal record is allowed to have that', 'record exposed to you for one purpose and one purpose only, and', 'that is for you to use this information, if you think it is important,', 'in assisting you among the many other things that you would look', 'at in assessing this witness’[s] credibility as a witness in this', 'particular case and for no other reason, to assess his credibility, if', 'you think it’s important in addition to the other instructions that I', 'will give you about the credibility of witnesses generally at the end', 'of this case.” The defendant lodged no objection to this instruction.', 'Carter’s sordid tale continued on the afternoon of the same day of the trial, during which Carter again testified over objection that he committed a robbery with defendant on June 13, 2007. Following a few questions that focused on the murders and a request from defendant’s counsel to approach the bench without the stenographer, the trial justice gave the jury another instruction:', '-8-', '“Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard another reference', 'to the witness’[s] testimony about an alleged robbery that was', 'committed by h[im] and the defendant on the 13th of June. I gave', 'you an instruction when you first heard about that in the morning', 'session, if you recall that, about the uses to which that could be', 'put.', '“In the first instance, it can only be used against this', 'witness if you think it’s important in assessing his credibility with', 'regard to the defendant, Mr. Clements, who is the defendant in this', 'case. That information can be assimilated by you, but it cannot be', 'used by you as to what we call propensity evidence. Therefore,', 'what I mean by that is if you believe that this witness is truthful', 'with regard to what he is saying about that particular event, you', 'may not, therefore, say because the defendant has done that which', 'appears to be an established fact, what has been introduced, he,', 'therefore, must have killed these two women. You cannot make', 'that leap. They’re two unconnected activities. So the Court is', 'cautioning you that while that is properly before you, you cannot', 'say, well, if he robbed somebody that afternoon, he, therefore must', 'have killed these two women. That is not appropriate.” As with the instruction earlier in the day, this instruction also did not prompt an objection from defendant.', 'Finally, during his final charge to the jury, the trial justice imparted another instruction about the evidence of the robbery. The final jury charge included the following:', '“Now, in this case, you have heard evidence that on other', 'occasions this defendant may have been involved in other criminal', 'activity or misconduct. The Court has allowed that evidence', 'before you, but the evidence before you cannot be used by you to', 'determine that because he may have done something else that may', 'have either been illegal or inappropriate that, therefore, he must', 'have committed the charges for which he is on trial for today. You', 'may not use that information in that regard at all so we cannot have', 'a propensity or character evidence that says, therefore, if some', 'person does a bad act over here, then they must have done the bad', 'act over here. So you cannot use that information for that purpose', 'at all.” The defendant did not object to this part of the final jury instructions.', '-9-', 'On appeal before this Court, defendant contends that the admission of this evidence violated Rule 404(b) and Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. He further argues that the trial justice’s cautionary instructions were deficient and that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying his motion to pass based on the prosecutor’s reference to this evidence during closing argument.', 'III', 'Admission of the Evidence', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]t is well settled that we review a trial justice’s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v.

Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 624, 382 A.2d 526, 532 (1978)). The valid purposes for which such evidence may be offered include establishing motive or intent, “prov[ing] a material element of the crime” charged, and introducing such evidence “when crimes are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for ‘a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.’” Id. at 949, 950 (quoting State v.

We further held that playing the entirety of the bail-hearing testimony was excessive. See id. at 953.', 'After that defendant was retried and again convicted, he appealed a second time, occasioning a second review of the admission of a lesser amount of Rule 404(b) evidence at the retrial. Pona II, 66 A.3d at 465. In Pona II, we affirmed the conviction because the trial justice permitted the admission of that evidence that was necessary to demonstrate the victim’s role in the investigation of the first murder, but the trial justice “excluded evidence related solely to the prior murder itself, which had no probative force.” Id. at 468.', 'In this case, the evidence of the daytime robbery had scant relevance to the crimes for which defendant was being tried. Although the state argues that the evidence was necessary to establish the relationship between defendant and his confederate, Anthony Carter, there already had been ample testimony about that relationship, and the evidence of the robbery did not particularly sound on that relationship. See Pona II, 66 A.3d at 468 (approving the exclusion of evidence that related solely to another crime because it “had no probative force”). Carter himself testified that he and defendant practically had grown up together in the training school, and, after he was released from the ACI, he hung out with defendant and even stayed at defendant’s home.', '- 12 - Additionally, Jessica Carter testified that she saw her brother and defendant together nearly every day.', 'The state’s argument that the evidence of the robbery was admissible to prove the conspiracy count is equally unpersuasive. The state relies on State v. Chartier, 619 A.2d 1119, 1122-23 (R.I. 1993), in which evidence about one of a series of robberies was admissible to demonstrate a defendant’s “knowledge and acceptance of the criminal intent” of his associates in committing two other robberies in the same evening.', 'But here, the robbery at issue was committed many hours before the murders, and nothing in the record appears to suggest that there was any connection whatsoever between that particular robbery and the two grisly murders that occurred early the following morning.', 'Our conclusion that there was minimal nonpropensity purpose for admitting evidence of the robbery is buttressed by the nature of the testimony about the robbery. That testimony was limited to the fact that the robbery took place, that Carter pleaded guilty to the robbery and conspiracy, and that defendant was involved in both the robbery and the conspiracy to commit it. The questions about those crimes elicited little information that might further illuminate the relationship between defendant and Anthony Carter or suggest that the robbery was somehow connected to the murders, such as the reason for the robbery, the nature of the planning of the robbery, the amount of money obtained, or what happened to that money.', 'The evidence about the June 13, 2007 robbery is problematical under Rule 404(b). Thus, we must now determine whether, under the facts of this case, the admission of that evidence warrants vacating the convictions.', 'It is our considered opinion that the mountain of evidence against this defendant leads to the singular conclusion that the evidence of the robbery the day before the murders, admitted', '- 13 - pursuant to Rule 404(b), even if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Anthony Carter testified that he and defendant agreed upon their course of action in response to the victims extorting them for money. He also explained in exquisite detail about the murders, including the methods that each of them used to kill the victims and the fact that they decided to burn the bodies in a failed attempt to destroy evidence. The forensic evidence, including the testimony of the medical examiner and the discovery of trace elements of accelerants, confirmed much of Carter’s testimony about how the murders took place and the manner of death.', 'Anthony Carter also informed the jury about the pair’s arrival at defendant’s home drenched in blood, a fact which Jessica Carter confirmed in her testimony. Both Carters also testified that defendant told his wife about the crimes that he and Anthony Carter had just committed. Additionally, Jessica Carter related to the jury that, after defendant returned from Florida, he explained to her in detail what he and her brother had done and why they had done it. Carter’s grandmother also confirmed that she had rented a car for defendant and Carter; her description of that vehicle matched the description of the car seen by a Providence police officer outside Jesus’ apartment immediately before the fire was discovered. Carter’s grandmother’s testimony also disclosed that Clements and his wife each had requested that she tell her grandson to deny that he and defendant were together at the time of the murders. In our opinion, the outcome of this trial would have been the same with or without the jury’s learning of the robbery on June 13.', '- 14 -', 'C', 'Rule 403', 'Rule 403 says that “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', 'This rule “cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence[.]” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 466 (quoting Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 148).

In Smith, 39 A.3d at 676, we declined to find error in a trial justice’s allowance of testimony about a defendant’s prior weapons training when that testimony was offered to cast light on the reasonableness of a witness’s fear of disclosing molestation.

Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)).', 'In the case presently before us, defendant contends that the trial justice’s instructions regarding the use of the robbery evidence do not pass muster. Specifically, defendant argues that the instructions failed to inform the jury of the permitted uses of the evidence and explained only that the panel was forbidden to use the evidence to find defendant guilty based on his commission of the robbery. Significant to our consideration, however, each time the trial justice imparted the instructions that defendant now claims were deficient, defendant failed to object. We hold, therefore, that defendant failed to preserve his objections to the content of the limiting instructions given to the jury.', 'IV', 'Motion to Pass', 'During the state’s closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the robbery evidence and informed the jury that, in his statement to police, defendant had admitted to committing the robbery and to conspiring to commit it. Specifically, the prosecutor argued that defendant’s statement to police was totally unworthy of belief, summarizing defendant’s statement to the police as follows: “Yeah, I was in that car. Yes, I was driving. Yes, I was with Anthony, same', '- 16 - guy, I was with him hours before I committed that robbery and conspired with him to rob these two people, same guy.” After the state’s closing argument ended, defendant moved to pass the case, arguing that there had been no reference to the robbery in defendant’s statement to police. The trial justice denied the motion, explaining that he would again tell the jury that it should not use the evidence of the robbery, for which defendant was not on trial, to find defendant guilty of the crimes with which he was charged.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“We review a trial justice’s decision on a motion to pass a case for abuse of discretion.” State v.

Figueroa, 673 A.2d 1084, 1091 (R.I. 1996)). “Therefore, the refusal of the trial justice to pass a case is accorded great deference and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown to be clearly wrong.” Id.', 'B', 'Discussion', '“A prosecutor is given considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.” State v.

There, a prosecutor suggested that a defense witness’s denial that the charged conduct had taken place possibly resulted from repressed memories, and he explained that inconsistencies exposed during cross-examination of state child witnesses were caused by the witnesses’ exhaustion and desire to agree to anything to end the cross-examination. Id. at 884-85. We said that the “explanations * * * , though conjectural, were within the array of reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the facts presented at trial, and they were neither extraneous nor inflammatory.” Id. at 886. In declining to reverse based on the prosecutor’s comments, we also relied on the trial justice’s instruction to the jury that closing arguments are not evidence. Id.', 'Here, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the motion to pass.', 'The prosecutor’s closing argument misstated that the defendant had admitted in his statement to police that he had committed the June 13, 2007 robbery. That comment was made as the prosecutor attempted to convey the inconceivability of the defendant’s version of the facts, in which he claimed that he had been present at Jesus’ building during the killings but remained outside on the porch while Carter murdered both Jesus and Sousa. See Boillard, 789 A.2d at 886.', 'The believability of the defendant’s story was certainly a proper subject of closing argument, and, in the context of assailing that story, the prosecutor was simply recounting that the defendant had admitted doing many things with Anthony Carter while emphasizing that the one thing that the defendant denied doing with Carter was entering Jesus’ apartment and', '- 18 - committing these murders. The trial justice instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence, and the prosecutor referred to a crime about which the jury already had heard testimony that was not so prejudicial as to violate Rule 403. Thus, although the defendant had not admitted to police that he participated in the robbery, the prosecutor’s comment in these circumstances was not likely to “inflame and arouse the passions of the jury.” See Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885-86 (quoting Mancini, 108 R.I. at 273-74, 274 A.2d at 748).

On appeal, the defendant contends that, in denying his motion for a new trial, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence and failed to draw the appropriate inferences from the evidence presented. Specifically, he posits that the testimony of two of the key witnesses at trial—Ramon Jimenez and John Nazario—was not credible.

He was charged with two', '-1- counts of assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (Counts One & Two); two counts of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(2) (Counts Three & Four); carrying a handgun on his person without a license in violation of § 11-47-8(a) (Count Five); and discharging a firearm within a compact area in violation of § 11-47-50 (Count Six).', 'In March of 2011, a jury trial was held in Providence County Superior Court. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Evidence at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Ramon Jimenez', 'Ramon Jimenez, one of the two victims of the December 2009 shooting, testified through an interpreter. He stated that, on the evening of December 22, he had met his friend Ambiorix Tiburcio at a liquor store on Dexter Street in Providence. Mr. Jimenez stated that the purpose of this meeting was to deliver a green Honda Civic, which Mr. Tiburcio had purchased from him. Mr. Jimenez further testified that he and Mr. Tiburcio then drove in the Honda to another liquor store on Reservoir Avenue; they entered the liquor store and stayed for approximately a half- hour. Mr. Jimenez added that they thereafter drove the short distance to the home of Mr. Jimenez’s sister on Alexander Street in Cranston, where he parked the car in front of her home.', 'It was Mr. Jimenez’s testimony that, while he and Mr. Tiburcio were still sitting in the parked Honda, a white BMW X51 pulled up alongside the Honda so that the passenger side of 1', 'Fred Rios, the owner of Fred’s Auto House in Warwick, testified that he performed repairs on a white 2002 BMW X5 registered to one Larissa Jarrett in December of 2009 after having provided an estimate over the phone to a man identifying himself as “John Silva.” Mr. Rios further testified that he completed the repairs to the BMW, which had been towed to his place of business from another repair facility, on December 22 and that a man also identifying', '-2- the BMW was alongside the driver’s side of the Honda. Mr. Jimenez, who was seated in the driver’s seat of the Honda, stated that he began rolling down his window and observed that the window on the passenger side of the BMW was rolled down. Mr. Jimenez testified that he saw a person in the BMW who said “Yo” and then “started shooting.” He further testified that one of the bullets hit him in the left arm and another hit him in the left leg. It was also Mr. Jimenez’s testimony that he recognized the shooter as a man whom he had known for four or five years; he added that he knew that person by the name “Black.”', 'Mr. Jimenez testified that, when the police arrived at the scene of the shooting, he told them that a man named “Black” who “lived on Narragansett” had shot him and that the shooter was driving a white BMW; he added that, while he was in the rescue vehicle, the police told him that they believed the man known to Mr. Jimenez as “Black” was actually “John Silva.” It was Mr. Jimenez’s testimony that he also told the police that, when he and Mr. Tiburcio had been standing outside the Reservoir Avenue liquor store earlier on that evening, he had seen the same white BMW pass by him driving “very, very slow[ly].”', 'Mr. Jimenez further testified that, while he was at Rhode Island Hospital later on that evening, he identified “Black” as defendant out of a photo array provided to him by the police. That photo array was entered into evidence at trial as a full exhibit. At trial, Mr. Jimenez also identified the man known to him as “Black” as defendant.', 'With respect to defendant’s motive, Mr. Jimenez testified that, on December 24, two days after the shooting, he told Officer Lee Sohn that he had sold defendant a black Ford F-150 pick- up truck but that defendant had never completely paid for that vehicle. In response to a question posed to him on cross-examination, Mr. Jimenez stated that he “[didn’t] think” that he told the himself as “John Silva” picked up the vehicle on the afternoon of that day. In his testimony, Mr. Rios described the man who picked up the vehicle as being a heavy-set black man.', '-3- police that defendant had shot at him because he had “played around with” a woman whom defendant had dated and that defendant was “jealous.”', '2. The Testimony of Ambiorix Tiburcio', 'Ambiorix Tiburcio, the other victim of the shooting, also testified through an interpreter; his testimony was largely consistent with that of Mr. Jimenez with respect to the events at issue. Mr. Tiburcio stated that, approximately one minute after he and Mr. Jimenez arrived in front of the home of Mr. Jimenez’s sister and, while they were both still sitting in the car, a white BMW “Jeep”2 with tinted windows pulled up alongside the Honda. Mr. Tiburcio testified that he told Mr. Jimenez to look at the BMW; he added that Mr. Jimenez (who had been driving) then began to roll down the driver’s window of the Honda while the window on the passenger side of the BMW was descending. According to Mr. Tiburcio’s testimony, he saw a black man inside the BMW who said “Hey, yo” or “Yo” and then started shooting at them; however, he could not provide any additional identifying details with respect to the shooter. He testified that one of the bullets hit him in the left arm and another hit him in the left leg.', '3. The Testimony of Officer Lee Sohn', 'Officer Lee Sohn of the Cranston Police Department testified that, on the evening of December 22, 2009, he responded to a dispatch informing him that shots had been fired near Alexander Street. Officer Sohn testified that, after arriving at the scene of the shooting, he spoke to Mr. Jimenez while Mr. Jimenez was lying on the ground near the Honda. He stated that he asked Mr. Jimenez if he knew who had shot him and that Mr. Jimenez described the shooter as a black male driving a white BMW that he characterized as an SUV. Officer Sohn stated that Mr. Jimenez also told him that the man who shot him was named “Black.” 2', 'It is clear from the context that the testifying witness (or his interpreter) used the word “Jeep” as a synonym for an SUV.', '-4-', 'It was Officer Sohn’s testimony that, when he visited Mr. Jimenez in the hospital on the day after the shooting, Mr. Jimenez told him that the shooting may have stemmed from a “jealousy thing.” At trial, he stated that he did not know if the shooting “had to do with a girl,” but he acknowledged that he had written the following in his police report: “Jimenez could not provide me with any information with regards to this girl or why [Mr. Silva] would be jealous.” The officer added that Mr. Jimenez also told him that defendant may have shot at him “over the sale of a truck.”', '4. The Testimony of Detective Warren Henseler', 'Detective Warren Henseler of the Cranston Police Department testified that he heard the police dispatch concerning the shooting and that he responded to Alexander Street. Detective Henseler testified that, while speaking to Mr. Jimenez in the rescue vehicle, he asked him who shot him. He further testified that Mr. Jimenez replied “Black;” he said that he then asked Mr. Jimenez if the man who shot him was named “John Silva.”3 According to Det. Henseler, the BMW allegedly used in the shooting was located in April of 2010 at Greenville Auto Sales in Johnston.4', '5. The Testimony of John Nazario', 'John Nazario also testified at trial. Mr. Nazario testified that he was a friend of the defendant, whom he also knew by the name “Black.” At the time of trial, Mr. Nazario was in 3', 'Officer Sohn, who was also present in the rescue vehicle at the time of the conversation referenced in the text, testified that Mr. Jimenez replied “Black” and that Mr. Jimenez also gave the name “John Silva;” he added that Det.

According to the terms of the plea agreement, Mr. Nazario pled guilty to federal charges relating to the distribution of crack cocaine and, in consideration of his cooperation in the prosecution of defendant, the United States Attorney agreed to recommend a reduced sentence for those offenses.', 'At trial, Mr. Nazario stated that, in 2009, he recalled seeing defendant driving, among other vehicles, a white BMW. It was Mr. Nazario’s testimony that, in late December of that year, he met defendant at defendant’s home.', 'He also testified that defendant called him approximately a week after that meeting and asked him if he “wanted to clean a car,” as he had previous experience cleaning cars, and he agreed to do so. Mr. Nazario further testified that defendant picked him up in a rental car and that, while they were driving to purchase cleaning supplies, he asked defendant, “[I]s this the car that I think it is[?]” To that question, defendant replied, “Yes.” Mr. Nazario stated that they then drove to the home of defendant’s father, where he saw a white BMW parked on the grass directly behind the house; he added that one would not have been able to observe the car until reaching the back of the narrow driveway.', 'Mr. Nazario testified that he began to clean the car and that defendant instructed him to clean the passenger side. Mr. Nazario stated at trial that defendant replied in the affirmative when he asked him if the BMW which was being cleaned was the same BMW as was involved in the shooting in Cranston. It was Mr. Nazario’s further testimony that he asked defendant to show him how he had fired the gun so that he would know where to remove the gunpowder residue; he said that defendant responded by stating that his left hand had been on the steering wheel and that he had used his right hand to fire the gun out the passenger window of the car. Mr. Nazario added that he, therefore, concentrated on cleaning the area from the middle console', '-6- over to the passenger side of the BMW and that he knew how to remove gunpowder residue as a result of his having consulted Google.', 'Mr. Nazario stated that defendant picked him up again on the day after the first cleaning and that he then proceeded to clean the BMW more thoroughly than the first time. According to Mr. Nazario’s testimony at trial, defendant told him to clean the front passenger side door, specifically instructing him to take the door apart so that he might access the inside of the door with an air compressor in order to remove the gunpowder residue. Mr. Nazario stated that he cleaned the BMW four or five more times in total.', 'Mr. Nazario acknowledged on cross-examination that, when he first met with the police after being arrested on April 15, 2010, he told them that during the Winter defendant had been involved in the shooting of two men in Cranston.', 'He further acknowledged on cross- examination that he also told the police on April 15 that, after the shooting in Cranston had occurred, he drove with defendant to a car dealership in Johnston5 to “drop off the BMW” because defendant “knew he had to get rid of [it] * * * .” Mr. Nazario then signed his plea agreement on September 24, 2010. Subsequently, on November 1, 2010, Mr. Nazario again met with the police and provided more specific details with respect to defendant’s involvement in the shooting, including the fact that the shooting took place in December of 2009. However, Mr. Nazario testified that he was aware that the shooting had occurred in December of 2009 the first time he met with the police; when explaining why he did not disclose the date of the shooting until the second time he met with the police, Mr. Nazario stated: “April 15th was not when I was supposed to be telling the truth and the whole truth. That’s not when I signed the [plea 5', 'At trial, Mr. Nazario identified the picture of the white BMW seized by the police from Greenville Auto Sales, which had been entered into evidence as a full exhibit, as being the same one that he had cleaned and driven to the car dealership.', '-7- agreement].” He further testified that he did not give his “complete statement” at the first meeting because he was “scared;” he added that “after that signed deal was put in place, [he] just wasn’t scared anymore.”', 'B', 'The Jury Verdict and the Subsequent Motion for New Trial', 'On March 24, 2011, the jury found defendant guilty on all six counts. Subsequently, on April 1, 2011, defendant moved for a new trial; defendant argued that the jury misconstrued evidence that was presented at trial, specifically with respect to the testimony of Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Nazario, and that a new trial should be granted in the interests of justice. The trial justice denied the motion.', 'The trial justice sentenced defendant on May 19, 2011 as follows: 1) on Counts One and Two, defendant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of twenty years imprisonment, ten years to serve; 2) on Counts Three and Four, defendant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of twenty years, with fifteen years to serve, to run consecutively to Counts One and Two; 3) on Count Five, defendant was sentenced to a term of five years suspended, with probation, to run concurrently with Counts One and Two; and 4) on Count Six, defendant was sentenced to one year to run concurrently with Counts One, Two, and Five.', 'The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court. On appeal, defendant challenges only the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he denied the motion for a new trial because, in defendant’s view, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material', '-8- evidence and failed to draw all appropriate inferences from the evidence presented; defendant focuses his argument on what he characterizes as the lack of credibility of the witnesses at trial, specifically Mr. Nazario and Mr. Jimenez. The defendant further submits that the verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice between the parties.', 'When deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for new trial, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 841 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 102 (R.I. 2012); State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011). In passing on a motion for new trial, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006). If, after conducting this three-step analysis, “the trial justice concludes that reasonable minds could differ as to the result or if the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury did, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Espinal, 943 A.2d at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 984 (R.I. 2007). If, however, the trial justice disagrees with the verdict or “does not agree that reasonable minds could differ, then the trial justice must determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 445 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. DeOliveira, 972 A.2d 653, 665 (R.I. 2009).', '-9-', ""This Court has stated that the “record should reflect a few sentences of the justice's reasoning on each point[,] * * * [but] the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision * * * .” State v.

Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140-41 (R.I. 2008). Accordingly, this Court “will not overturn a trial justice’s determination with regard to such a motion unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Texieira, 944 A.2d at 141 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102.', 'It is clear from the record that, before ruling on the motion, the trial justice completed each of the three analytical steps that are called for when a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial. We are satisfied that the trial justice considered the evidence in light of the jury charge and that he then independently evaluated the evidence and weighed the credibility of the witnesses. In the course of summarizing the testimony of Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Nazario, he expressly noted that “this case, like so many others, centered on the credibility of the witnesses,” specifically the credibility of Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Nazario, whose testimony he considered to be “truly determinative of the outcome” in the case. The trial judge stated that he found both Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Nazario to be “extremely credible” and that the “jury rightly found them, as', '- 10 - [he] did, to be trustworthy witnesses.” It was also his determination that Mr. Nazario and Mr. Jimenez were subject to “severe and exhaustive” cross-examination on their prior criminal records and other issues. Importantly, the trial justice stated that the jury still chose to “credit their testimony.” Moreover, according to the trial justice, all of the state’s other witnesses, “generally, and in some fashion, supported or corroborated something of what Jimenez and Nazario had related” at trial. He further stated, “As a front row observer, I am well satisfied that the jury’s confidence in their testimony was not at all misplaced.”', 'This Court affords a “substantial amount of deference to [the] determinations” of the trial justice with respect to credibility of the witnesses. See DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 572 (R.I. 2011) (quoting B.S. International Ltd. v. JMAM, LLC, 13 A.3d 1057, 1062 (R.I. 2011)). On appeal, defendant is essentially asking this Court to second-guess the trial justice’s credibility determinations.', 'With respect to the testimony of Mr. Jimenez, defendant asserts that he was not a credible witnesses because: 1) his testimony with respect to defendant’s motivation for carrying out the shooting was vague and inconsistent; and 2) his testimony that he was able to identify defendant as the man inside the BMW was, in defendant’s opinion, contradicted by the testimony of Mr. Tiburcio, who could only discern that the person inside the BMW was a black male. Mr. Jimenez testified that he turned towards the BMW in order to lower the window of the Honda so that he could see who had parked next to him. It was well within the trial justice’s role, as the thirteenth juror, to accept the testimony of Mr. Jimenez that he recognized defendant as the person who shot him through the lowered window of the BMW, despite his inability or unwillingness to clearly explain defendant’s motivation for doing so. Furthermore, it has been our judgment on more than one occasion that “the presence of some inconsistencies between or', '- 11 - among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012); see, e.g., State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 948–49 (R.I. 2012); State v. Shepard, 33 A.3d 158, 164 (R.I. 2011).', 'With respect to the testimony of Mr. Nazario, defendant argues that his testimony was not credible in light of the timing of his disclosure of evidence that tended to incriminate defendant. The trial justice was entitled to believe Mr. Nazario’s testimony that defendant asked him, as a friend who had experience cleaning cars, to help him clean the BMW but that he did not disclose the full extent of his knowledge of defendant’s involvement in the shooting until after he had signed his plea bargain because he was “scared.” This Court has repeatedly stated that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010).', 'Upon concluding his analysis, the trial justice stated: “[The] verdicts were well supported by the testimony, and I am easily satisfied that John Silva is guilty as the verdicts reflect and his guilt was proved beyond all reasonable doubt on all counts.” That determination is a significant consideration in this Court’s review of a denial of a motion for new trial; we have consistently held that, if after conducting the required three-step analysis the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, “then the inquiry is at an end and the motion for a new trial should be denied.” State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011); see State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012); State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010).

86,State : v. : Linda A. Diamante. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Linda A. Diamante, appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of a motion in which she sought the sealing of a particular judicial record.1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 24, 1994, defendant was charged by criminal information (P2/94-3350A) with felony assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (Count One) and 1', 'The motion at issue in this case was actually entitled “Motion to Expunge/Seal Record.” For the sake of brevity, we shall hereinafter refer to it simply as a “motion to seal.”', '-1- willful or malicious injury to property in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-44-1 (Count Two). In July of 1995, Count One was dismissed in consideration of defendant pleading nolo contendere to Count Two.2 The defendant was sentenced to one year of probation and was ordered to make restitution.', 'Nearly a decade later, on March 5, 2004, defendant filed, in the Superior Court for Providence County, a motion to seal with respect to both of the counts contained in P2/94- 3350A.3 That motion was denied in its entirety by a justice of the Superior Court on February 16, 2005. The defendant confines herself on appeal to the hearing justice’s denial, in reliance upon G.L. 1956 § 12-1-12.1(a), of her motion with respect to Count One; she does not appeal the denial of her motion as it related to Count Two.', 'When explaining her rationale for denying defendant’s motion to seal as it related to Count One, the hearing justice stated:', '“The defendant * * * was seeking * * * to have the charges', 'that were dismissed in * * * 1995 sealed, because they were', 'dismissed pursuant to [Rule] 48(a) or [Rule] 48(b) by the Court.', '* * * The State objected to that, indicating under the statute, Rhode', 'Island General Laws 12-1-3.1,[4] the defendant is not entitled to 2', 'Count One was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 3', 'In 1992, defendant was charged with reckless driving and obstructing a police officer in P3/92-3798A. She pled nolo contendere to the reckless driving charge, and the charge of obstructing a police officer was dismissed. The defendant was sentenced to one year of probation.', 'It should be noted that, in her order of February 16, 2005, the hearing justice denied defendant’s motion to seal relative to those 1992 charges, as she had done with respect to the 1994 charges. The defendant does not appeal that denial. Consequently, this Court will focus only on the 1994 charges. 4', 'As is reflected in the block quote in the text, supra, the transcript contains a reference to “Rhode Island General Laws 12-1-3.1.” That reference is inaccurate since there is no § 12-1-3.1 in the General Laws. However, in view of the fact that the hearing justice accurately made', '-2-', 'sealing a dismissed charge unless acquitted of all counts in a', 'criminal case. The statute does seem to say that. I don’t know how', 'we can interpret that any differently. So, I have to deny those', 'motions.” The defendant appealed the hearing justice’s denial of her motion to seal as it related to Count One of the October 1994 criminal information.5', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the hearing justice erred in denying the motion to seal the record relative to the dismissed 1994 charge of felony assault with a dangerous weapon. Specifically, defendant argues that § 12-1-12(a) and § 12-1-12.1(a) are in conflict because, in her view, § 12-1-12(a) mandates the sealing of all court records relating to a charge on which an individual has been exonerated, whereas § 12-1-12.1(a) allows for a motion to seal court records only when an individual has been “acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts in a criminal case.” (Emphasis added.)', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews questions of statutory construction in a de novo manner.

It is a reference to certain critical language in § 12-1-12.1(a) (“all counts in a criminal case”), we deem the erroneous statutory reference to be of no moment. 5', 'We note that defendant’s appeal was filed prior to the entry of a final order in the Superior Court, which occurred on April 12, 2013.

At the time of the trial justice’s decision, § 12-1-12(a) provided as follows:', '“Any fingerprint, photograph, physical measurements, or other', 'record of identification, heretofore or hereafter taken by or under', 'the direction of the attorney general, the superintendent of state', 'police, the member or members of the police department of any', 'city or town or any other officer authorized by this chapter to take', 'them, of a person under arrest, prior to the final conviction of the', 'person for the offense then charged, shall be destroyed by all', 'offices or departments having the custody or possession within', 'sixty (60) days after there has been an acquittal, dismissal, no true', 'bill, no information, or the person has been otherwise exonerated', 'from the offense with which he or she is charged, and the clerk of', 'court where the exoneration has taken place shall, consistent with §', '12-1-12.1, place under seal all records of the person in the case', 'including all records of the division of criminal identification', 'established by § 12-1-4; provided that the person shall not have', 'been previously convicted of any felony offense. Any person who', 'shall violate any provision of this section shall be fined not', 'exceeding one hundred dollars ($100).”', '-4- Similarly, at that time, § 12-1-12.1(a) provided as follows:', '“Any person who is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts', 'in a criminal case, including, but not limited to, dismissal or filing', 'of a no true bill or no information, may file for the sealing of his or', 'her court records in the case, provided, that no person who has', 'been convicted of a felony shall have his or her court records', 'sealed pursuant to this section.”6', 'A disposition amounting to exoneration is one of the preconditions for relief under both of these statutes, and the parties agree that defendant was clearly “exonerated” of Count One in the 1994 information due to the fact that the state dismissed that charge.', 'The defendant asserts that the hearing justice erred in denying the motion to seal because, defendant submits, §§ 12-1-12(a) and 12-1-12.1(a) are in conflict. The defendant posits that the conflict exists because § 12-1-12(a) provides for the sealing of all court records by the clerk of the court within sixty days after exoneration, provided the person has not previously been convicted of a felony and, therefore, the sealing of her court record pertaining to Count One, 6', 'Sections 12-1-12(a) and 12-1-12.1(a) were amended by the General Assembly effective July 15, 2013 by P.L. 2013, ch. 301, § 1. The amendment did not result in any material, substantive changes that would affect the instant case. The amended portion of § 12-1-12(a) reads as follows:', '“(2) Any person previously convicted of any felony offense', 'shall not be entitled to relief under this section except for those', 'records in cases of acquittal after trial.”', '“(3) Any person who shall violate any provision of this', 'section shall be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100).” As amended § 12-1-12.1(a) reads:', '“Any person who is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of', 'all counts in a criminal case, including, but not limited to,', 'dismissal or filing of a no true bill or no information, may file a', 'motion for the sealing of his or her court records in the case,', 'provided, that no person who has been convicted of a felony shall', 'be entitled to relief under this section except for those records in', 'cases of acquittal after trial.”', '-5- pursuant to § 12-1-12(a), is mandatory and not discretionary. However, § 12-1-12.1(a) provides for the sealing of all court records only when a person is exonerated of “all counts in a criminal case.” According to defendant’s reading of the statutes, § 12-1-12(a) requires the sealing of court records that § 12-1-12.1(a) does not allow to be sealed. The defendant avers that, because of the alleged conflict, this Court should not rely merely on the plain language of the statute.', 'The state counters, contending that the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) clearly requires exoneration of all counts in a criminal case in order for the individual to be eligible to have his or her record sealed. Moreover, the state argues, § 12-1-12(a) deals with the destruction of physical identification records whereas § 12-1-12.1(a) deals with court records. The state also points out that the only time that court records are mentioned in § 12-1-12(a), a specific reference to the sealing requirements of § 12-1-12.1(a) is made. Consequently, the state contends: (1) that there is no conflict between the two statutory provisions; and (2) that this Court should affirm the trial justice’s decision because it is based on the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a).', 'Pursuant to our canons of statutory construction, we first address whether or not the statute in question has a plain meaning and is, as such, unambiguous. See DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 617; State v. DiCicco, 707 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 1998). If we find the statute to be unambiguous, we simply apply the plain meaning and our interpretive task is done. See, e.g., State v. Graff, 17 A.3d 1005, 1010 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]e have indicated that a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1110 (R.I. 2005) (“[W]hen we examine an unambiguous statute, there is no room for statutory construction and we must apply the statute as written.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). We end the process of statutory construction upon concluding that a statute has a plain meaning because “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent,” and we have', '-6- repeatedly observed that the plain language of a statute is the “best indicator of [legislative] intent.” Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 534 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003) (“[O]ur ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent * * * [and] [t]he best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.”); Fleet National Bank v. Clark, 714 A.2d 1172, 1177 (R.I. 1998) (“If the language is clear on its face, then the plain meaning of the statute must be given effect and the Court should not look elsewhere to discern the legislative intent.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Little v. Conflict of Interest Commission, 121 R.I. 232, 237, 397 A.2d 884, 887 (1979) (“It is a primary canon of statutory construction that statutory intent is to be found in the words of a statute, if they are free from ambiguity and express a reasonable meaning.”).', 'We begin by scrutinizing § 12-1-12.1(a), an enactment that relates to judicial records. That statute expressly requires a dismissal of all counts in a criminal case for an individual to be eligible to have his or her record of a dismissed charge sealed: “Any person who is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts in a criminal case * * * may file a motion for the sealing of his or her court records in the case * * * .” (Emphasis added.) We detect no ambiguity in the General Assembly’s use of the words “all counts.” The General Assembly certainly “has not sounded an uncertain trumpet” since the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) clearly requires that an individual be exonerated of all counts in a criminal case in order to have the record in that case sealed. State v. Calise, 478 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 1984) (“In the case at bar the Legislature has not sounded an uncertain trumpet.”). Any other interpretation would require this Court to ignore the statute’s pellucid “all counts” language and, in essence, rewrite the statute—thereby flying in the face of the fundamental principle that a court should not rewrite a statute enacted by the General', '-7- Assembly. See Calise, 478 A.2d at 201 (stating that the Court has “neither the authority nor the competence to rewrite” a statutory definition); see also Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359 (2005) (stating that a court is simply “not free to rewrite [a] statute that Congress has enacted”). Moreover, we have repeatedly held that a Court may not “broaden statutory provisions by judicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the clear intent or defining the terms of the statute.” State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Rivera v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 70 A.3d 905, 910 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]e have noted that [w]here there is no ambiguity, we are not privileged to legislate, by inclusion, words which are not found in the statute.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Iselin v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049 (R.I. 2008) (“[O]ur assigned task is simply to interpret the act, not to redraft it * * * .”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing justice appropriately applied the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) in denying defendant’s motion to seal, as she was required to do. See State v. Manocchio, 743 A.2d 555, 558 (R.I. 2000) (stating that the Superior Court does not possess an “inherent power to disregard the specific criteria and limitations on the expungement and sealing of * * * records that are set forth in the statute”); see generally Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1, 89-90 (1823) (“[W]here the words of a law * * * have a plain and obvious meaning, all construction, in hostility with such meaning, is excluded.”); see also Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010- 12 (finding error in a trial justice’s overly expansive interpretation of a statute). When we apply the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a), we reach precisely the same conclusion as did the hearing justice: pursuant to that statute, defendant was not entitled to have her record pertaining to Count', '-8- One sealed because she opted to plead nolo contendere to Count Two, and, consequently, she was not exonerated of “all counts[.]”', 'The defendant contends that, in spite of the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a), we must go beyond the plain meaning in our analysis because the just cited statute, in defendant’s view, is in conflict with § 12-1-12(a). Upon review of both statutes, however, we are unable to perceive the presence of any conflict. The pertinent language of § 12-1-12(a), which defendant submits is in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a), reads as follows: “[W]ithin sixty (60) days after there has been an acquittal, dismissal, no true bill, no information, or the person has been otherwise exonerated from the offense with which he or she is charged, the clerk of court where the exoneration has taken place shall, consistent with § 12-1-12.1, place under seal all records of the person in the case including all records of the division of criminal identification established by § 12-1-4 * * * .” (Emphasis added.) Even if we assume arguendo that defendant’s contention is correct and that § 12-1-12(a) is mandatory, there is no conflict created in view of the clear reference in § 12-1-12(a) to § 12-1-12.1. It is a basic canon of statutory construction that “the Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the court will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 777, 779 (R.I. 1996); see also State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 752 (R.I. 1981). The General Assembly specifically and unambiguously required that the sealing of records under § 12-1-12(a) be consistent with § 12-1-12.1. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no conflict between § 12-1-12(a) and § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-12(a) requires the sealing of court records only when doing so would be permissible under § 12-1-12.1(a). As a result, we hold that the hearing justice did not err by hewing to the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) when passing upon defendant’s motion to seal.', '-9-', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Further Arguments', 'The defendant has set forth some further arguments to support her contention that the hearing justice’s order was in error.', 'We address these arguments briefly.', 'The defendant contends that § 12-1-7 is also in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-7 requires that the Attorney General maintain only a record of information of “all persons who shall be or shall have been convicted of [a] felony, or imprisoned for violating any of the military, naval, or criminal laws of the United States or of any state, and of all well-known and habitual criminals from wherever procurable.” According to defendant, the duty of the Attorney General pursuant to § 12-1-7 does not include the maintenance of records of those individuals who have been convicted of a misdemeanor or had charges against them dismissed. The defendant posits that § 12-1-7 is in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-12.1(a) prohibits the sealing of records that § 12-1-7 does not require the Attorney General to maintain. However, we perceive no conflict between the fact that the Attorney General is required by statute to maintain only records of felony convictions and the fact that the courts are prohibited from sealing a dismissed felony charge when there was a plea of nolo contendere to an accompanying misdemeanor charge, as occurred in the instant case. Each of the two statutory provisions clearly applies to an entirely different governmental body, and consequently the statutes are not even arguably in conflict. See Olamuyiwa, 45 A.3d at 534 (stating that, when a statute is clear and unambiguous the Court gives the words in the statute their plain and ordinary meaning).', 'Moreover, defendant’s contention that these two statutes are in conflict, even if it were meritorious, does not change the conclusion that this Court has made—viz., that the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) requires', '- 10 - exoneration on all counts in a criminal case before an individual is eligible to have his or her record sealed.', 'Finally, defendant further argues that the General Assembly “did not intend for those individuals with a companion misdemeanor charge to be prohibited from destruction of all other ‘felony’ charges that they were exonerated of * * * .” The defendant, citing the difficulties that an individual encounters when there is a record of his or her arrest, contends that there is no legitimate law enforcement purpose in maintaining the record of charges on which she has been exonerated. Once again, while we do not minimize the challenges that a record of arrest can pose, defendant’s contentions are unavailing due to the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a)—and a statute’s plain language is “the best indicator of legislative intent.” Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010; see also Santos, 870 A.2d at 1032. We are not the branch of Rhode Island government responsible for policy-making; accordingly, any remedy to such hardship as may result from the application of the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) would fall within the competence of the General Assembly. See Air Distribution Corp. v. Airpro Mechanical Co., Inc., 973 A.2d 537, 542 (R.I. 2009); see generally, Massachusetts Financial Services, Inc. v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 545 F.2d 754, 757-58 (1st Cir. 1976).', 'Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice did not err when she denied the defendant’s motion to seal Count One, pursuant to § 12-1-12.1(a), because the defendant had not been exonerated of all counts in the criminal case.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to seal.

After a six-day trial, a Superior Court jury convicted the defendant, Mustapha Bojang (defendant), of two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. The defendant contends that the trial justice committed three errors that require this Court to vacate those convictions: (1) the denial of the defendant’s motion to suppress statements made to police during a post-arrest interrogation; (2) the refusal to allow the defendant to inquire into a false accusation of physical abuse by the complainant against her mother; and (3) the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth below, we remand the case to the Superior Court with directions to the trial justice to make additional findings of fact and credibility determinations concerning the voluntariness of the defendant’s confessions.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant came to the United States from West Africa in 2005 on a student visa. After brief stays in Maryland and Missouri, defendant settled in Woonsocket with the Manneh family. Mrs. Manneh (Jainoba) was the cousin of defendant’s wife, who remained in Africa', '-1- while defendant traveled to the United States. Jainoba1 lived in a second-floor apartment with her husband, Abou Manneh, and their three children, including the complainant, Jasmine.2 The defendant lived with the Manneh family from January 2005 until December 2007; a number of other adult males also lived in the apartment with the Mannehs from time to time.3 Because he was home in the afternoon, defendant would sometimes babysit Jasmine if neither Abou nor Jainoba was home.', 'The sexual abuse that is the subject of this case occurred in 2007, when Jasmine was eight years old. Jasmine first disclosed the sexual molestations to her fourth-grade teacher and a school guidance counselor in January 2009. After Jasmine reported defendant’s alleged abuse, the school officials contacted the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). When DCYF investigator Sue Kalo (Kalo) interviewed Jasmine, she disclosed that she was raped twice by defendant. Soon after that interview, Jasmine was examined by Dr. Christine Barron (Dr. Barron); the child indicated two separate instances of sexual abuse to Dr. Barron. Doctor Barron’s examination was normal, revealing no evidence of physical trauma.', 'When Jasmine’s father learned about her disclosures, he met with Kalo and reported the sexual abuse allegations to the Woonsocket police on January 27, 2009.', 'Based on the information provided by DCYF and a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) interview, Woonsocket Police Det.

Detective Hammann and Woonsocket Police Det. Ronald LaBreche (Det. LaBreche) arrested defendant at that site on February 2, 2009.', 'Woonsocket Police Officer Anthony Conetta transported defendant to the Woonsocket police station. For clarity, we recount the evidence concerning the voluntariness of defendant’s statements as gleaned from the entire trial record and not simply the suppression hearing.', 'Once at the police station, Dets. Hammann and LaBreche conducted two interviews with defendant: an initial unrecorded interview followed by a recorded confession.4 The detectives first placed defendant in the juvenile conference room, which has no recording equipment. During that interview, defendant agreed to waive his Miranda rights and signed a rights form. The testimony at trial produced divergent accounts of the events in the first interview room. At trial, the detectives testified that the interview was largely calm, although Det. LaBreche raised his voice and pounded on the table to get defendant’s attention.', 'While the detectives acknowledge raising defendant’s immigration status during the interview, each officer denied threatening deportation if he refused to cooperate.5 On the other hand, defendant testified at trial that, after he accused Jasmine of lying, Det. LaBreche responded, “Kids don’t lie” and struck him in the head. According to defendant, after he expressed a willingness to take a lie detector test, Det. LeBreche hit him again and said, “This is your lie detector test. Shut the f*** up.” 4', 'The Woonsocket Police Department’s policy gives the detective in charge of an investigation the discretion as to whether to use the interview room with recording capabilities. Detective Hammann testified that officers in his unit typically begin interviewing suspects or victims in the juvenile conference room, which lacks recording capabilities, because it is closer to their cubicles than the interview room with recording capabilities. 5', 'At trial, defendant testified that his visa had expired about two months before he was arrested. Although he had applied for permanent resident status, he had not yet received a response.', '-3- The defendant also alleged that the detectives told him that he would be deported if he refused to cooperate.', 'Detective Hammann testified that, after first denying the allegations against him, defendant admitted that he kissed Jasmine on the lips and that on one occasion he stuck his finger in Jasmine’s vagina. Detective LaBreche initially testified that, after defendant admitted to kissing Jasmine on the lips, the detectives decided to bring him to the interview room with recording capabilities.', 'After having his recollection refreshed by Det. Hamman’s witness statement, however, Det. LaBreche testified that, in the first interview, defendant also confessed to sticking his finger in Jasmine’s vagina and rubbing up against her on two occasions, once when she was clothed and the other unclothed.', 'According to Det. Hammann, after the verbal admissions, he requested that defendant provide a video and audio interview, and defendant agreed. The detective brought defendant to a different room with recording capabilities. Once again, defendant signed a form waiving his Miranda rights. In the recorded interview, defendant admitted to assaulting Jasmine multiple times. He admitted to kissing her three times and rubbing against her while clothed “a couple of times.” He admitted to penetrating her vagina digitally, while in the family sitting room, when Jasmine was home sick from school. Finally, defendant admitted to rubbing his naked body against hers, while on his bed, until he ejaculated. We pause to note that, although defendant argued, both in the papers and again at oral argument, that the jury’s verdict related only to the crimes to which he confessed, such is not the case. The defendant never admitted to penile', '-4- penetration, yet the jury found him guilty of count 8, which charged defendant with “[First] degree child molestation sexual assault, to wit, penis to vagina * * *.”6', 'Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress all statements to the police, arguing that use of those statements would violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution because the statements were “the result of physical, psychological coercion and also because of the State’s or the police department’s failure to record the interrogation in its entirety.”7', 'After a two-day hearing, however, the trial justice denied the motion. In his bench decision, he noted the difference in dynamics of Det. Hammann’s direct examination and cross-examination testimony, as well as the witness’s professed failure of memory about portions of the first interrogation. Specifically, Det. Hammann could not remember whether a table was pounded or whether Det. LeBreche struck defendant in the head.', 'However, the trial justice failed to make any credibility determinations concerning Det. Hammann’s testimony.', 'Turning to the videotaped confession, however, the trial justice found that defendant was relaxed and not apprehensive. Ultimately, the trial justice declared that the state had proven by clear and convincing evidence that the confession obtained during the second interview was not the product of coercion and that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.', 'At trial, the videotaped interview was admitted into evidence and played for the jury, over defendant’s renewed objection. Detective LaBreche—who did not testify at the suppression 6', 'The jury instructions for first-degree child molestation sexual assault required proof of sexual penetration, defined as “any intrusion, however slight, by any part of one person’s body into the genital openings of another person’s body.” 7', 'The challenge to admissibility based on the failure to record the entire interview is not before this Court and is therefore deemed waived.', '-5- hearing—testified about incriminating statements defendant also made during the first interview. Detective Hammann also gave similar testimony about the first interview. The record discloses that both detectives were subject to vigorous cross-examination respecting the voluntariness of defendant’s confessions.', 'At trial, Jasmine described a number of sexual assaults by defendant. She testified that, when she was eight years old and in second grade, defendant pulled her into his room, locked the door, shut off the light, and took her clothes off. He then pushed her onto his bed and engaged in vaginal intercourse with her.', 'Jasmine testified that during this molestation, defendant threatened to kill her or beat her up if she told anyone. After the intercourse ended, Jasmine noticed something white and wet in the middle of the bed, and defendant asked her to get a napkin for him. Jasmine then went to the bathroom, where she noticed blood on her vagina and underwear.', 'Next, Jasmine testified to another similar assault where defendant carried her from the living room to his bedroom and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse while her parents were not home. Again, she noticed blood. The child also liked to play online games on defendant’s computer. One day, when she asked to use his computer, he told her she had to come into his room. Although she refused, Jasmine testified that defendant pulled her into his room anyway and again engaged in sexual intercourse with her.', 'Jasmine testified to five other instances of forced sexual intercourse. One instance occurred on the couch when she was home sick from school; another assault occurred in his bedroom after she returned from her aunt’s house; another assault occurred in her bedroom; and two more assaults occurred in defendant’s bedroom. Additionally, Jasmine testified that during one of the assaults in defendant’s bedroom, he also digitally penetrated her vagina.', '-6-', 'Doctor Barron also testified during the state’s case-in-chief.', 'As noted above, her physical examination of Jasmine was normal and showed no signs of trauma.', 'However, Dr. Barron testified that a normal examination does not rule out sexual abuse and that “95 percent of children will have a normal exam, particularly if they’re examined [more than] two weeks outside of the incident.” At the time of Dr. Barron’s examination, on January 27, 2009, Jasmine’s allegations of sexual abuse related to events which allegedly occurred a year earlier. She therefore concluded that the medical examination neither ruled out nor confirmed the possibility of sexual abuse.', 'In accordance with this state’s Humane Practice Rule, the trial justice’s charge to the jury included an instruction that, in order to consider defendant’s custodial interrogation, the jury must find that the prosecution had proved by clear and convincing evidence that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on two counts, one for digital penetration (count 7) and one for penile penetration (count 8), but found defendant not guilty on the remaining counts of penile penetration.8', 'After trial, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The arguments focused on the consistency or inconsistency of Jasmine’s testimony as well as the testimony of other witnesses. In his bench decision, the trial justice recounted much of the salient testimony. Again referring to the testimony from the suppression hearing, the trial justice acknowledged that he made no finding on whether defendant had been struck by a police officer in the first interrogation; but, noting defendant’s demeanor in the second, recorded interview, he was satisfied that defendant was not coerced into making his statement: 8', 'Counts 1-6 and count 8, in the indictment as well as set forth on the verdict form, recite identical charges of first-degree child molestation sexual assault for penile-vaginal penetration. No bill of particulars was filed in this case.', '-7-', '“I’ve noted on the record prior to this that I did observe Mr.', 'Bojang to have some degree of comfort as the video progressed.', 'Even if the police officer had, in fact, struck Mr. Bojang, and I', 'made no finding on that issue, but it did not appear Mr. Bojang on', 'the videotape was coerced into giving that statement.” Based on his review of the evidence, the trial justice denied the motion for a new trial. The trial justice sentenced defendant to thirty years, twenty years to serve, ten years suspended with probation on each count, running concurrently.', 'Motion to Suppress Confession', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by denying his motion to suppress his statements to police obtained during a custodial interrogation. “Both the Rhode Island and the United States Constitutions bar the use of a defendant’s involuntary statements in a criminal trial.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 835 (R.I. 2008) (citing State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1274 (R.I. 1998)). In order for the trial justice to admit a defendant’s statement at trial, “the state must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his or her right against self-incrimination and that the statement was voluntary.” State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 790 (R.I. 2007) (citing Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274). This inquiry “requires an analysis of the ‘totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.’” State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 734 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Leuthavone, 640 A.2d 515, 519 (R.I. 1994)). “A voluntary statement is a product of free will and rational choice, whereas a statement is deemed involuntary when the defendant’s will was overcome by coercion, threats, violence, or undue influence.” Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 790 (citing Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274). If the trial justice is satisfied, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant’s will was not overcome by coercion, threats, violence, or other undue influence and the confession was the product of his rational choice, the motion to suppress must be denied. See id. This Court applies the following two-step review of a trial justice’s finding of voluntariness:', '-8-', '“First, we review the trial justice’s findings of historical fact with', 'deference, and we will not overturn those findings unless they are', 'clearly erroneous. * * * Second, because this issue is of', 'constitutional dimension, we accept the historical facts and', 'credibility determinations, and we then conduct de novo review of', 'the trial justice’s conclusion that the confession was voluntary.”', 'Id. (citing State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178, 1183 (R.I. 1999)). In this analysis, we consider the totality of the circumstances. Id. at 791; see also Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734.', 'In addition to this constitutional analysis, in this jurisdiction we employ the Humane Practice Rule, under which the trial justice first makes his or her own determination on the voluntariness of the confession. State v. Tassone, 749 A.2d 1112, 1118 (R.I. 2000). If the trial justice determines that the statement was made voluntarily, he or she', '“is required to instruct the jury that, based on the totality of the', 'circumstances, ‘it must find by clear and convincing evidence that', 'the defendant’s confession was voluntary, and that [the] defendant', 'had been advised of his constitutional guarantee against self-', 'incrimination (the Miranda Rights so-called), before the jury may', 'consider the statement as evidence.’” State v. Aponte, 800 A.2d', '420, 427 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Tassone, 749 A.2d at 1118). Thus, under the Humane Practice Rule, both the trial justice and the jury must separately find, by clear and convincing evidence, that a confession was voluntary before it may be considered as evidence to support a conviction. See id.', 'In his bench decision on the motion to suppress, the trial justice failed to adequately perform his factfinding analysis regarding the first interview. Although he noted that Det. Hammann repeatedly declared that he could not remember whether Det. LaBreche pounded the table or slapped defendant in the head during the first interrogation, he declined to rule on those questions or address what effect that conduct, if proven, might have on the question of voluntariness of either confession. Additionally, the trial justice noted Det. Hammann’s delayed response time to questions posed during cross-examination, “all of which [left the trial justice]', '-9- wondering exactly what went on in [the first] interview room * * *.” Summarizing his thoughts, the trial justice stated,', '“Based on the observations that I just put on the record, I', 'did not find any apprehension, if there was any, that was', 'manifested by the conduct that I observed in the interview. I’m not', 'sure what caused the detective to break down and be unable to', 'answer the questions in this particular case other than I understand', 'the argument about the tacit admissions, I also understand that you', 'have a police officer who may be apprehensive as well that', 'somebody could put some words in his mouth. I’m speculating. I', 'am speculating here because I don’t know. I listened and I', 'watched intently and that cross-examination went on for a great', 'deal of time. So, while I had some forty minutes to watch Mr.', 'Bojang on the video, I had an equally long time to observe', 'Detective Hammann. Even if I grant that Detective Hammann’s', 'not remembering and his failure to answer is a tacit admission, in', 'order to suppress the confession I still have to find that whatever', 'occurred in interview room (number one) where there was no', 'recording, I have to find that induced Mr. Bojang into making that', 'confession, and even if I get to the first set of inferences, and if we', 'get to a jury in this case, I’ll tell the jury what an inference is, and', 'they are free to draw inferences, and [defense counsel] is going to', 'be able to cross-examine the detective pretty much the same way', 'he did here in the courtroom * * * .” However, regarding the second, recorded interview, the trial justice concluded that defendant was relaxed, not overly apprehensive, and became increasingly comfortable as the interview progressed.', 'Notwithstanding his observations about the first interview, the trial justice found that the recorded confession was not the product of coercion and denied the motion to suppress:', '“Now, all of that being said, I find that the State has proven', 'by clear and convincing evidence that the confession was not the', 'product of coercion, and I also find that Mr. Bojang knowingly,', 'intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights that', 'are expressed in the case of Miranda versus Arizona, and my', 'findings are based on the articulations that I just made in the past', 'several minutes and especially my watching of Mr. Bojang as he', 'read the form during interview number two. He took some time to', 'read that form, checked off various parts of it, and affixed his', 'signature at the end.', '- 10 -', '“I will note the defendant’s exception to the Court’s ruling.', 'I’m going to deny the motion to suppress.”', 'The State’s Concession', 'Before this Court, the state has conceded that the trial justice failed to make the findings of fact and credibility determinations that are essential to support his ultimate finding of voluntariness. The state argues that the case should be remanded for either a new evidentiary hearing or, at least, additional findings on defendant’s motion to suppress.9 In the wake of this concession, defendant altered course respecting the relief he seeks.', 'In his opening brief, defendant argued that he was entitled to a new evidentiary hearing to determine the voluntariness of his statement; however, in his reply brief he has abandoned that argument and now he contends that this Court must vacate the convictions, suppress the statements, and grant him a new trial.10', 'Our case law in this area is clear and unwavering; the appropriate procedure in this circumstance is to remand the case to the Superior Court so that the trial justice can make the appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. In Andrews v. Langlois, 105 R.I. 456, 458, 252 A.2d 450, 452 (1969), this Court reviewed a petition for habeas corpus stemming from a conviction after a trial in which the trial justice failed to conduct a preliminary hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of the petitioner’s confession. The trial justice admitted into evidence a signed statement and a tape recording of an oral statement at trial; the defendant was convicted 9', 'Although the state’s brief requests a new evidentiary hearing, when asked at oral argument whether the state was seeking a new evidentiary hearing or additional findings based on the current record, the state declined to take a position. 10', 'At oral argument, when asked whether defendant preferred a new evidentiary hearing or merely additional findings based on the current record if the case was remanded, defense counsel responded that a remand should be limited to additional findings based only on the record of the suppression hearing. Notably, defendant did not testify at the suppression hearing.', '- 11 - of second-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Id. at 457, 458, 252 A.2d at 451, 452. In the face of this error, this Court laid out a procedural roadmap for similar situations; the Court stated,', '“If the jury had been properly instructed on the law governing the', 'issue of voluntariness, we would remit this case to the [S]uperior', '[C]ourt for a limited hearing on [the issue of the voluntariness of', 'his confession] alone. If at such hearing it was determined that the', 'confession was voluntary and admissible in evidence, a new trial', 'on the question of guilt or innocence would not necessarily be', 'required because petitioner has already been tried by a jury and', 'been found guilty. If, on the other hand, at the limited hearing it', 'was determined that the confession was involuntary, there would', 'have to be a new trial on guilt or innocence, without the', 'confessions being admitted in evidence.” Id. at 461-62, 252 A.2d', 'at 454 (emphases added). Ultimately, the Court granted a new trial to the defendant because of “an erroneous [jury] charge on the question of voluntariness.” Id. at 462, 252 A.2d at 454. Here, however, defendant does not allege that the trial justice’s Humane Practice instruction to the jury on voluntariness was erroneous. Thus, the procedure mandating a limited remand is appropriate.', 'Since our decision in Andrews, this Court has employed the same procedure in cases in which there has been a flawed suppression hearing. In State v. Brown, 468 A.2d 914, 914 (R.I. 1983), the sole issue raised on appeal was the denial of the defendant’s motion to suppress a statement given to police following his warrantless arrest. The defendant asserted that the police officer lacked probable cause to arrest him, but the trial justice sustained an objection to a question posed to the arresting police officer on hearsay grounds at the suppression hearing. Id. On appeal, this Court noted that probable cause may be established by hearsay evidence, and “[o]nly with this information in the record could the trial justice initially, and this court now, determine whether or not the officer or officers who arrested the defendant had probable cause to do so.” Id. at 915. We thereupon remanded the case “for an evidentiary hearing and for findings', '- 12 - of fact on the issue of probable cause for [the defendant’s] arrest.” Id. Likewise, in State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438, 442 (R.I. 1996), the defendant sought to suppress the fruits of an allegedly illegal search under the knock-and-announce rule. However, “the trial justice * * * did not articulate any factual findings either in speech or in writing in regard to his ruling denying defendant’s motion to suppress in the first instance,” id. at 443, and this Court vacated the decision and remanded the case “in order to allow the trial justice to enter findings of fact and to make the determination in the first instance of whether the unannounced entry by police was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” Id.', 'More recently, in State v. Verrecchia, 766 A.2d 377, 380 (R.I. 2001), the trial justice found that the defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in a garage that he rented; thus, the trial justice did not analyze whether a search of that garage was reasonable. On appeal, this Court held that the defendant did have an expectation of privacy in the garage and remanded the case “for a hearing on [the defendant’s] motion to suppress so that the court can determine whether the police violated any of [the defendant’s] constitutional rights by searching his garage and by seizing certain property found therein as evidence of his criminal acts.” Id. at 384. In our mandate to the Superior Court, this Court directed,', '“If the motion justice concludes after conducting this hearing that', 'the evidence should not be suppressed, he or she should enter an', 'order to that effect and the convictions shall stand as affirmed,', 'subject to any appeal concerning this ruling. If, on the other hand,', 'the motion justice decides to grant the motion to suppress, then he', 'or she shall vacate [the defendant’s] convictions and conduct a new', 'trial.” Id. at 391.', 'This procedure reflects our longstanding reluctance to engage in factfinding or to make credibility determinations in the first instance. See, e.g., Brown, 468 A.2d at 915 (“With the present state of the record, we are unable to consider this appeal.”). The trial justice is uniquely positioned to make findings of fact. See State v. Chum, 54 A.3d 455, 460 (R.I. 2012) (noting', '- 13 - that deference is given to a trial justice’s factual findings). Conversely, “[t]he cold record does not enable an appellate court to evaluate how the witness’s demeanor may have affected his credibility.” State v. Young, 456 A.2d 739, 741 (R.I. 1983).', 'Therefore, we remand the case for the trial justice to make additional findings of fact and credibility determinations regarding the first interview.', 'The Scope of the Remand', 'The dissent’s only point of disagreement is the scope of the remand. The dissent would limit the remand to the record of the suppression hearing. We, however, leave to the trial justice the decision to permit or disallow additional evidence or to limit his analysis to the trial testimony. None of the cases cited by the majority are inapposite; these holdings support the well settled mechanism of a limited remand. While the dissent is correct that the cases we cite do not present precisely the same situation that we have here, in none of those cases did the Court explicitly strip the trial justice of the discretion to permit additional evidence. We decline to do so today.', 'The cases cited by the dissent do not compel this Court to change its practice of vesting trial justices with the discretion to conduct proceedings as they see fit. The justices of the Superior Court are in a far better position than this Court to determine the best procedure to justly resolve the issues that confront them. The dissent cites United States v. Kithcart, 218 F.3d 213 (3d Cir. 2000), for its holding that the trial court erred by permitting additional evidence after a remand of a suppression issue. The Third Circuit, however, concluded that the error was “in admitting additional evidence upon remand without the explanation that is required” under the Third Circuit’s precedent United States v. Vastola, 915 F.2d 865, 876 (3d Cir. 1990). Kithcart, 218 F.3d at 221 (emphasis added). The Third Circuit declared, “the question of', '- 14 - whether the government may augment the record at a suppression hearing after a remand is analogous to the question of whether the government may reopen its case after resting. Such decisions are traditionally within the discretion of the district court.”11 Id. at 219 (citing Vastola, 915 F.2d at 876) (emphasis added). Vesting the trial justice with such discretion is similarly the practice of this state. Cf. State v. Benevides, 420 A.2d 65, 68 (R.I. 1980) (“[A] motion to reopen a case to introduce additional evidence is addressed to the discretion of the trial justice and a decision made in the exercise of such discretionary power will not be disturbed by this court on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of that discretion.”).', 'Additionally, Southern v. State, 807 A.2d 13 (Md. 2002) is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the holding is grounded in a unique rule of appellate procedure in Maryland and Maryland case law. See id. at 24 (relying on “the intent of [Md. Rule 8-604(d)(1)] and Maryland case law reviewing this rule”). Second, the facts are widely divergent. In Southern, 807 A.2d at 21, the court stated,', '“This is not a case where the motions hearing judge simply did not', 'rule, it is a case where the State, which had the burden of proof on', 'the constitutionality of the initial detention at the suppression', 'hearing, admits that it did not present sufficient evidence to', 'support the constitutionality of the stop.” (Emphasis added.) In the case before us, the trial justice “simply did not rule.”', 'Finally, the Court notes that there was extensive testimony at trial respecting the voluntariness of the confession in accordance with this state’s Humane Practice Rule. Thus, the trial justice heard a great deal of evidence relating to the issue on remand. We decline to direct a justice of the Superior Court to ignore hundreds of pages of testimony in deciding this discrete issue. 11', 'Notably, the dissent employs the first sentence of this quotation, but omits the second. It also lacks any discussion of this state’s analogous practice on motions to reopen.', '- 15 -', 'Therefore, we leave to the trial justice the decision to permit or disallow additional evidence or to limit his analysis to the trial testimony.', 'Exclusion of Prior False Accusation', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by refusing to allow defendant to inquire into the complainant’s prior false accusation of physical abuse against her mother. In a voir dire hearing, Jasmine testified, on cross-examination, that—about a month before she first disclosed the sexual abuse at issue here—she was intimidated by a bully at school, who told her to tell the teacher that her mother abused her, or the bully would kill her; Jasmine admitted that her mother did not abuse her. The defendant argues that the evidence was admissible under Rules 608(b) and 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and that, to the extent this issue was preserved,12 the exclusion violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. “We review a challenge to a trial justice’s limitation on cross- examination under an abuse of discretion standard, and we will not disturb the exercise of that discretion absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Chum, 54 A.3d at 460. The ruling must amount to “prejudicial error” to constitute a clear abuse of discretion. Id. “Nonetheless, we have held that the trial justice’s ‘discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the constitutional guarantees involved.’” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 621 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Patriarca, 112 R.I. 14, 37, 308 A.2d 300, 315 (1973)).', 'Rule 608(b) provides,', '“Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the', 'purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other', 'than conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, or, in the', 'discretion of the trial judge, evidence of prior similar false', 'accusations, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, 12', 'At oral argument, despite a record devoid of a direct reference to the Sixth Amendment or the right of confrontation, the state conceded that the Sixth Amendment argument was preserved.', '- 16 -', 'however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness', 'or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the', 'witness (1) concerning the witness’ character for truthfulness or', 'untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or', 'untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness', 'being cross-examined has testified.” In this case, the trial justice found that Jasmine’s allegations of physical abuse against her mother were not sufficiently similar to the sexual abuse allegations against defendant. We agree. A prior allegation of sexual assault by someone other than the accused differs markedly from an allegation of physical assault against one’s parent.', 'Although not directly addressing Rule 608(b), in State v. Botelho, 753 A.2d 343, 346-47 (R.I. 2000), this Court acknowledged our prior cases that permitted cross-examination into previous sexual assault allegations in sexual assault prosecutions, but concluded that a complainant’s “complaint of excessive discipline, purportedly lodged against her father and her mother’s former boyfriend, is fundamentally different from a complaint of sexual molestation.” Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion under Rule 608(b) by preventing cross-examination into Jasmine’s prior allegation against her mother.', 'Rule 404(b) provides that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts” may be admissible to prove “motive[.]” On appeal, defendant contends that Jasmine’s accusations of rape were “motivated by [Jasmine’s] fear of [a] sadistic bully.” We reject this contention. Although Jasmine did testify in the voir dire hearing that a bully at school told her to make an allegation of abuse against her mother, there is no suggestion that the bully told Jasmine to make a rape allegation. Indeed, Jasmine testified that the bully did not tell her to make a rape allegation, nor did the bully even know about the abuse:', '“Q: Did [the bully] ever tell you something like, you should tell', 'that somebody raped you?', '“A: No, she didn’t know about it.”', '- 17 - Thus, there is no evidence that Jasmine’s fear of the bully motivated her to allege sexual abuse against defendant.', 'We pause to note that the exclusion of this evidence precisely reflects policy considerations that underlie Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which provides for the exclusion of evidence when “its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of * * * confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury * * *.” See State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147-48 (R.I. 2009) (noting that “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence”). Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion under Rule 404(b) by preventing cross- examination into Jasmine’s prior allegation against her mother.', 'The Confrontation Clause secures the right to cross-examine witnesses. Botelho, 753 A.2d at 345 (“The right to cross-examine witnesses is a primary interest secured by the [C]onfrontation [C]lause.”).', 'A criminal defendant has a “well-established, constitutionally- protected right * * * to [an] effective cross-examination of the prosecution’s witnesses.” State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 198 (R.I. 2012). That right is not absolute. Id. “[T]rial justices retain a considerable degree of discretion to impose reasonable limitations on cross-examination in order to prevent, inter alia, harassment, prejudice, confusion, or repetitive testimony.”', 'State v. Tiernan, 941 A.2d 129, 134 (R.I. 2008).', '“To satisfy the constitutional right of cross- examination, ‘the trial justice is required to afford the accused “reasonable latitude” to establish or reveal bias, prejudice, or ulterior motives as they may relate to the case being tried.’” State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 575 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Bustamante, 756 A.2d 758, 765 (R.I. 2000)).', '- 18 -', 'Here, defendant was provided with an ample opportunity to cross-examine Jasmine; he deftly tested the consistency of her testimony at trial and in her prior statements. Furthermore, during the voir dire hearing, Jasmine denied that the bully told her to make a rape allegation. It was appropriate for the trial justice to draw the line and not allow inquiry into the prior accusation because it would have served only to confuse the jury. See Botelho, 753 A.2d at 347 (admission of certain evidence “would have served only to confuse and mislead the jury”). Therefore, the trial justice’s refusal to allow cross-examination on Jasmine’s allegations against her mother did not violate the Confrontation Clause.', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked and misconstrued material evidence and clearly erred in denying the motion for a new trial.', 'Specifically, defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict because Jasmine was not a credible witness and, he argues, because the evidence established that defendant’s confession was coerced and unreliable.', 'The defendant also contends that the verdict is against the preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice between the parties.', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the', '- 19 - verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. (citing State v. Snow, 670 A.2d 239, 244 (R.I. 1996)).', 'In this case, the trial justice considered the evidence, independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and concluded that he would have reached the same result as the jury on the guilty counts.13 Because the trial justice agreed with the jury, his analysis was complete. See State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011) (“If the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, the inquiry is complete and the motion for a new trial should be denied.”). To the extent that the defendant argues that a new trial should be granted based on an error of law by the trial justice, that argument was not presented below; therefore it is waived. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 828-29 (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”). The defendant’s motion for a new trial raised three grounds: “Said verdict is against the law”; “Said verdict is against the evidence”; and “Said verdict is against the law, the evidence and the weight thereof.” None of these grounds alleged that a new trial should be granted because the trial justice committed an error of law by not suppressing the confessions. Stating that the verdict is “against the law” is a general challenge addressing the conformity of the evidence to the law in the case; it is not an argument that a specific ruling constituted an error of law requiring a new trial. Therefore, the trial justice did not err by denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of the motion for a new trial and discern no error arising from his evidentiary rulings. However, we remand the case to the Superior Court in order for the trial justice to make additional findings of fact and credibility 13', 'The trial justice stated that he may have found defendant guilty on all eight counts.', '- 20 - determinations concerning the voluntariness of the defendant’s confessions. The trial justice may permit additional evidence or decide this issue based on the current record. If the trial justice concludes that the motion to suppress should be denied, the trial justice should enter an order to that effect and the convictions shall stand as affirmed, subject to any appeal concerning that ruling by the trial justice. If the trial justice decides to grant the motion to suppress, then he shall vacate the defendant’s convictions and conduct a new trial without the confessions.', 'The papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court.', '- 21 -', 'Justice Flaherty, with whom Justice Robinson joins with the exception of footnote seven, dissenting in part and concurring in part. I respectfully dissent from that part of the Court’s opinion remanding this case to the trial justice for “additional findings of fact and credibility determinations regarding the first interview,” but also leaving the trial justice with the discretion to allow further testimony. In my opinion, the remand should be limited to fact- finding and credibility determinations based solely on the record of the suppression hearing.', 'To support its mandate, the majority cites four previous holdings of this Court. However, after reviewing those decisions, it is my opinion that each is either inapposite or otherwise does not supply a foundation for the majority’s reasoning. I agree with the majority that the remand should be for the limited purpose of requiring the trial justice to make findings of fact and a conclusion as to the issue of voluntariness based on the totality of the circumstances. However, none of the cases cited by the majority opinion supports reopening a hearing that already has occurred and that has been concluded. In contrast, those decisions support remanding for an evidentiary hearing when an error by the trial justice prevented a hearing from being held in the first instance. Because the parties in this case were afforded a full hearing, during which they were free to present and question any witness whom they wished to present or question, the remand in this case should prohibit the taking of new evidence rather than leaving the definition of the scope of the remand to the trial justice’s discretion.', 'The majority cites Andrews v. Langlois, 105 R.I. 456, 252 A.2d 450 (1969); however, in that case, this Court, when it reviewed the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, vacated a defendant’s conviction because the trial justice never made a preliminary determination that a confession was voluntary but instructed the jury that “even if the confession were not petitioner’s free act and deed, the jury had a right to weigh the confession as to its truth', '- 22 - or falsity. This was an erroneous statement of the law.” Id. at 461, 252 A.2d at 453. Thus, in light of the erroneous instruction, the Court concluded that a new trial would be necessary. Id. at 461, 252 A.2d at 454. Significant to this case, the Court in Andrews said that, but for the egregiousness of the faulty instruction, the appropriate remedy would have been a remand to the trial court for a hearing limited solely to the voluntariness of the confession because such a hearing had never been held. See id.', 'In State v. Brown, 468 A.2d 914 (R.I. 1983), the primary issue before the Court was the presence or absence of probable cause to arrest the defendant. The defendant argued that his confession should have been suppressed, not because it was involuntary, but because there was no probable cause to arrest him in the first place. Id. at 914. However, during a hearing to suppress the confession on that ground, the trial justice sustained an objection because a question posed to a police officer by the prosecutor called for a hearsay response. Id. Reasoning that probable cause may be established by hearsay evidence and determining that it could not consider the appeal based on a record that was restricted by the erroneous evidentiary ruling, the Court remanded the case to the trial court “for an evidentiary hearing and for findings of fact on the issue of probable cause for Brown’s arrest.” Id. at 915. Brown bears little resemblance to the considerations before the Court in this case.', 'The issue before the Court in State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438 (R.I. 1996), was whether a search was reasonable under the knock-and-announce rule or, in the alternative, whether the search violated the defendant’s rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id. at 442. The case was remanded to the trial justice with directions that he “enter findings of fact and to make the determination in the first instance of whether the unannounced entry by police was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 443. The', '- 23 - Court did not direct that an evidentiary hearing be held or that the record be expanded in any way. Id.', 'Finally, in State v. Verrechia, 766 A.2d 377 (R.I. 2001), the fourth case cited by the majority, the Court addressed the appeal of a criminal defendant who argued that the fruits of a search of a garage that he leased should be suppressed. Id. at 380. In that case, the trial justice declined to address the merits of the defendant’s motion to suppress because he found that the defendant had no expectation of privacy in the searched premises. Id. This Court disagreed, and it remanded the case for a “determination of whether the garage search violated [the defendant’s] constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures * * * .”', 'Id. at 381.', 'In Verrecchia, a new hearing on remand was required, because, based on his finding of no expectation of privacy, the trial justice had declined to afford a hearing to the defendant on the propriety of the search. Id. at 384.', 'The four just-discussed cases are simply not sufficiently analogous to the situation that confronts us in our consideration of this appeal. Here, a full hearing was conducted, and the parties had ample opportunity to develop the record. The difficulty here, as the majority has correctly pointed out, is that the trial justice did not make the appropriate credibility determinations and findings of fact before he determined that the state had proved that defendant’s confession was voluntary by clear and convincing evidence.', 'In my opinion, to reopen the suppression hearing and allow an expanded evidentiary hearing, in effect to allow a “do over” or “second bite at the apple,” is manifestly unjust. There is a substantial body of law that supports this position.', 'In Southern v. State, 807 A.2d 13, 15 (Md. 2002), the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that “it was improper for the Court of Special Appeals to remand and reopen the suppression', '- 24 - proceeding in order to provide the [s]tate with a second opportunity to present new evidence on the constitutionality of the initial stop.” In Southern, the defendant had filed a motion to suppress; at the hearing on that motion, evidence was presented about an interrogation and a post-apprehension show-up identification. Id. at 15-18. However, the prosecution failed to present any evidence that would justify the initial traffic stop. Id. at 17. The intermediate appellate court held that the trial judge had ruled on the other issues, but “fail[ed] to rule on the issue of the propriety of the initial stop.” Id. at 18. In Maryland, remand of appellate cases is governed by a specific rule of appellate procedure,1 but the Court of Appeals said that the rule was “neither an ‘antidote’ for the errors of the [s]tate or of counsel nor a method to correct errors committed during the trial itself.” Id. at 19. The Southern court thus concluded that the intermediate appellate court erred when its remand allowed for the presentation of additional evidence, pointing out that “[t]he purpose of the remand was not to correct a procedural error, but to afford the [s]tate an additional opportunity to do that which it previously failed to do— 1', 'I disagree with the majority that Maryland’s rule makes that jurisdiction an outlier. Rule 8-604 of the Maryland Rules provides in pertinent part:', '“(d) Remand. (1) Generally.

Id. at 24.', 'In 2004, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals treated as settled law the fact that a remand following a trial judge’s failure to make findings of fact when denying a motion to suppress a confession is cured by a remand for findings, without the taking of additional evidence. Perez v. State, 841 A.2d 372, 386 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2004) (“[I]f the problem were only a lack of specific findings, an option that we would have to address is whether to remand, without vacating the convictions, for the court to make findings on the existing record.” (citing Southern v.

Johnson v. State, 214 P.3d 983, 989 (Wyo. 2009). A new evidentiary hearing was not permitted; the Supreme Court reasoned that it was the trial court’s responsibility to make findings necessary to allow for appellate review.

The defendant entered a conditional guilty plea pending the appeal of the motion to suppress. Id. The intermediate appellate court was unable to determine whether the warrantless search overcame the presumption of unreasonableness, so it remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of whether the evidence was seized from within the curtilage of the home. Id. at 913.', 'After remand, the trial judge personally inspected the property and found that the evidence was seized from a location 100 yards from the defendant’s house, and not seventy-five yards as a police officer had testified during the suppression hearing. Ex parte Hergott, 588 So. 2d at 913. Based on this new finding, the trial judge found that the evidence had not been discovered within the curtilage of the home, and he denied the motion to suppress. Id. However, because the defendant had entered a conditional plea of guilty, jeopardy had attached; the Supreme Court held that “[o]nce jeopardy has attached, the [s]tate is not given a second chance to supply evidence that it failed to provide on the first opportunity.” Id. (citing Burks, 437 U.S. at 11). The court noted that the prosecution could have presented additional evidence at the initial hearing, but chose instead to rely on the testimony of a single officer. Id. at 914. Because the intermediate appellate court concluded that the state had failed to meet its burden during the suppression hearing, it reasoned that the case should not have been remanded. Id.', 'Several decisions of United States Circuit Courts of Appeals similarly favor limited remands rather than the reopening of suppression hearings. See, e.g., United States v. Fields, 4', '“The ‘open fields’ doctrine, first enunciated by th[e Supreme] Court in Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57 (1924), permits police officers to enter and search a field without a warrant.” Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 173 (1984).

In Kithcart, 218 F.3d at 219, a suppression hearing was held, after which the trial judge determined that there was probable cause to seize a gun from an automobile. Id. at 215-16. On appeal, the Third Circuit held that there was insufficient evidence to warrant probable cause, holding that the trial judge had relied on the vehicle’s occupants’ race and certain imprecise similarities between the stopped car and the suspects’ car. Id. at 216-17. As a result, the court remanded for a consideration of whether there had been reasonable suspicion that would have supported an investigative stop. Id. at 217.', 'On remand, the trial judge reopened the suppression hearing and allowed more evidence, including testimony by officers who had been involved in seizing the evidence but who had not testified at the first hearing. Kithcart, 218 F.3d at 218. After the hearing ended, the trial judge ruled that the stop had been justified, and he refused to suppress the evidence, sparking a second appeal. Id. at 218-19.', 'When the case again came before the Third Circuit, the court relied on an earlier case in which it held “that the question of whether the government may augment the record at a suppression hearing after a remand is analogous to the question of whether the government may reopen its case after resting.” Kithcart, 218 F.3d at 219 (citing United States v. Vastola, 915 F.2d 865, 876 (3d Cir. 1990)). The only reasons that the Third Circuit offered as potentially overcoming courts’ “extreme[] reluctan[ce]” to reopen suppression hearings were situations in which the “evidence was either newly discovered or [previously] unavailable.” 5 Id. at 219, 220. In determining that the remand should have been limited to the existing record, the court noted 5', 'Although the majority rests on a sentence saying that “[s]uch decisions are traditionally within the discretion of the district court,” Kithcart is clear that the discretion should be exercised in extremely limited circumstances, none of which is present here.

As the court explained, “[n]ot surprisingly, the government’s new testimony nicely filled the lacunae of the first hearing” and “neatly spackled over each of the cracks in the foundation of proof that [the Third Circuit] pointed out” in the first appeal. Id. at 218.', 'In Fields, 371 F.3d at 912-13, the Seventh Circuit considered the denial of a motion to suppress a gun after hearing testimony about how officers had gained entry into an apartment. When the trial judge denied the motion to suppress, she nonetheless said that she “would ‘not disguise [her] skepticism about the sequence of events as testified to by [a police officer],” who was the only officer who testified as to the method of entry. Id. at 913. However, because the trial judge failed to make findings as to the officers’ initial entry into the apartment, the Seventh Circuit remanded, stating that “[a]bsent a compelling reason otherwise, these determinations [of the constitutionality of a search and the extent of the exclusionary rule] should be based on the existing record and limited to the testimony and other evidence already presented.” Id. at 913, 917.', 'In this case, it is my firm opinion that the remand should be channeled by the existing record of the suppression hearing. I agree with those courts that have held that the state should have only one opportunity to present the evidence that is necessary to meet its burden. The considerations in Kithcart, 218 F.3d at 219-21, are similar to those confronting us here. In Kithcart, the officer who actually made the traffic stop did not testify at the suppression hearing and nothing suggested that any post-remand evidence was “either newly discovered or', '- 29 - unavailable during the first hearing.” Id. at 220. In this case, Det. LaBreche, whose conduct is being scrutinized, did not testify at the suppression hearing, but the state has not argued that there was any reason why he could not have done so.6 Nor is there any indication that there is any evidence that is now available that was not available when the motion to suppress the confession was heard.', 'The only apparent purpose for allowing additional testimony would be to remedy the lack of evidence about what happened when the defendant incriminated himself prior to the recording of the second confession. In my opinion, if the trial justice is unable, based upon the record of the suppression hearing, to find that, under the totality of the circumstances, the confession was voluntarily made, then the confession should be suppressed. Any shortcomings or inadequacies should not be washed over with a reopened hearing. By the same token, if the trial justice finds that the confession was voluntary, based on that same existing record, then the defendant’s decision not to testify or to present any evidence at the suppression hearing of the alleged coercion may prove to have borne fateful consequences.7 6', 'Both Det.

Before this Court, Santiago argues that the trial justice erred when she permitted the state to elicit testimony from the complaining witness that Santiago alleges was in violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We entertained this case on December 3, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2008, defendant met a woman named Chely on the internet. 1 During the course of their burgeoning online relationship, Santiago invited Chely to relocate to Rhode Island from Texas, and she eventually moved into defendant’s Central Falls apartment with two of her daughters, then ages six and seven.', 'On February 5, 2009, defendant was home alone with Chely’s daughters while their mother attended night classes. Doreen, the older of Chely’s daughters, asked defendant for permission to play a video game. Doreen said that Santiago told her that, to play the video games, she would have to “do something,” specifically, to “take a shower with him or touch his private part.” According to Doreen, defendant made her touch “his private part” under his clothes and move her hand back and forth. The defendant instructed Doreen to cover her eyes with her other hand so that she would not see. While recounting the events of that night, Doreen also said that after about a minute, defendant told her to go wash her hands because she had “white things around her hands.” She said that she did not know the source of the substance but that it had not been on her hand before she touched defendant. She also said that Santiago instructed her not to tell anyone what had occurred.', 'Despite that admonition, however, the following day Doreen informed her mother about what had happened. Chely and her daughters quickly vacated the apartment, and, a few days later, Chely reported the incident to the Central Falls Police Department. Chely and Doreen were referred by the police to the Child Advocacy Center (CAC) for an interview, and a trained CAC counselor interviewed the young girl on February 11, 2009. The interview was transcribed 1', 'We refer to the complaining witness’s mother by only her first name. Additionally, we employ a fictitious name to protect the complaining witness’s identity.', '-2- and recorded on videotape. During the CAC interview, Doreen provided details of the events of February 5, including the fact that when she touched defendant’s body part it felt hard. Santiago subsequently was arrested and charged with second-degree child molestation sexual assault.', 'Before trial, defendant filed a motion in limine, in which he sought to prevent the state from employing either the video recording or the transcript of the CAC interview of the complaining witness. A justice of the Superior Court agreed in part, ordering that the recording and transcript could not be used as a past recollection recorded. 2 However, the hearing justice was clear that her ruling did not prevent the use of that material to refresh the recollection of the complaining witness.', 'The case was reached for trial in November 2011. The day before the trial was to commence, Doreen met with prosecutors for the purpose of preparing her testimony. During that meeting, Doreen said that, when she touched defendant’s body part, it felt soft. Because that statement was at odds with what she had said in the past, Doreen was shown a copy of the transcript of her CAC interview, during the course of which she said that the body part felt hard.

The state, in accordance with its duty to update its discovery responses, notified defendant that, on the eve of her testimony, Doreen had expressed recollections that were inconsistent with her CAC interview and that the interview transcript “did not refresh her recollection.” The defendant already was aware, as a result of the hearing justice’s ruling on the motion in limine, that the CAC interview was fair game if it were to be used to refresh the witness’s recollection, and the state’s amended discovery response should have alerted defendant that it would attempt to do just that if Doreen were unable to recall whether defendant’s body part was hard when she touched it. See Werner, 831 A.2d at 202-03.', 'Unlike Pona, 810 A.2d at 249-50, where discovery was held to be sufficient despite the fact that a witness’s actual, in-court testimony was more detailed than the discovery that had been provided, here the state notified the defendant that Doreen’s memory had failed on the eve of her testimony and that her recollection had not been refreshed by her earlier statement. It is well settled that, when a party refreshes a witness’s recollection, the witness’s present memory of the event, rather than the memorandum used to revive the memory, stands as the evidence. Ricci, 639 A.2d at 67. Thus, the fact that the transcript did not refresh Doreen’s recollection during the preparation for her in-court testimony does not lead to the conclusion that the transcript would not refresh her recollection when she testified at trial. The content of and the inconsistency among Doreen’s statements was disclosed to the defendant and was a proper subject for cross-examination. In our opinion, the fact that the state notified the defendant that', '-7- Doreen’s recollection had not been refreshed on one occasion does not freeze the witness’s memory as of that moment.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

89,State : v. : Paul Fleck.,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Paul Fleck, appeals to this Court from a judgment of conviction of one count of simple domestic assault against Kim Dolbec in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5. Under the provisions of § 12-29-5(c)(1), the defendant was deemed to be a felon because he had been convicted at least twice previously of domestic-violence offenses. As a result, the trial justice sentenced Fleck to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), with three and one-half years to serve, and six and one-half years suspended, with probation. Before this Court, the defendant advances two arguments. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Second, he presses that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, and relevant to both arguments, the defendant maintains that the evidence presented at trial did not establish that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic', '-1- relationship, as is required under § 12-29-2. After a careful review of the defendant’s arguments, and for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arises from an incident that occurred during the course of an argument between defendant, Paul Fleck, and the complaining witness, Kim Dolbec, on September 13, 2009. Although the two were long acquainted, having first met in school nearly thirty years earlier, they had begun to date only some months before, after they were reintroduced by Dolbec’s neighbor, Heidi Leonard. At that time, both were living in East Providence. 1 Dolbec testified that soon after the pair began a relationship, she asked Fleck to move in with her, and that he did so, even though he continued to maintain his own apartment.', 'Dolbec testified that after she made dinner for defendant on September 13, defendant grabbed her by the arm and struck her in the face with a closed fist. Although by all indications this was the first incident of physical violence between the two, the substance of the argument was familiar to this couple because it arose when defendant accused Dolbec of cheating on him. As she did whenever defendant made such accusations, Dolbec denied them because, as she testified, she told him, “[w]hen I’m with somebody, I’m not a slut. Excuse my language.” Dolbec did not report the assault at that time; she testified that she did not do so because she was afraid that Fleck would kill her if she did. However, two nights later, on September 15, defendant made similar accusations, and this time the accusations were coupled with poking 1', 'The precise length of time that defendant and Dolbec dated is unclear because Dolbec testified that she had suffered a brain injury that caused her to forget certain details of her life and of her relationship with defendant. There were indications that Dolbec suffered that injury as a result of her being a victim of a separate domestic-violence incident that did not involve defendant. Dolbec testified that she and defendant had been dating for a few months, but she previously had told a responding police officer that the two had dated for a period of five months.', '-2- Dolbec in the chest. After this second incident, Dolbec left the apartment and went to Leonard’s residence because she could not “take [defendant] hitting [her] anymore.” After listening to Dolbec’s story, Leonard notified the police, who arrived after “just a few minutes.”', 'East Providence Police Officers Ryan Vose and Genevieve Rock responded to a call for a “delayed domestic assault,” and they took a statement from Dolbec. Officer Vose testified that he had observed that Dolbec was visibly shaken and that she had “a black eye that appeared to be coming down” as well as some bruising on her right arm. At the police station, the officers photographed Dolbec’s injuries; the photos eventually were entered into evidence. Dolbec related to Officer Vose that defendant had been her boyfriend for five months and that she had been living with him. Officer Vose noted on the Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Reporting (DVSA) form that Fleck was Dolbec’s “intimate partner.” Officer Rock also spoke with Dolbec at the Leonard residence, noting the bruises and that she appeared to be very nervous out of fear of Mr. Fleck. Officer Rock indicated that Dolbec’s bruises were consistent with her story of the physical abuse that she claimed had occurred two days earlier.', 'The East Providence Police apprehended Fleck on the evening of September 15 without incident, after spotting him on a park bench near Riverside Square in East Providence. Fleck was charged with one count of simple domestic assault on November 6, 2009. The defendant was tried before a jury on March 7-9, 2011.', 'At the conclusion of the prosecution’s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29. The defendant argued that the state had introduced insufficient evidence that Fleck and Dolbec had been in a domestic relationship, as that term is defined in § 12-29-2. After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the state as she was required to do, the trial justice concluded that there had', '-3- been a domestic relationship, and she denied the motion. The defendant then proceeded to present his defense. On March 9, 2011, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of simple domestic assault.', 'The defendant then filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 33, which the trial justice heard and decided on March 25, 2011. The defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt because, under § 12-29-2(b), Fleck and Dolbec did not meet the definition of a domestic relationship. Sitting as the thirteenth juror, the trial justice conducted the three analyses as outlined in State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1366-67 (R.I. 1994). The trial justice considered all of the evidence presented by the state and defendant. She found Dolbec credible, remarking that, when Dolbec did not remember something, she did not “pretend she knew it” and noted that her testimony had been corroborated by the responding officers and her neighbor, Heidi Leonard. The trial justice reviewed the evidence, noting that it supported a finding that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship. She further found that Fleck had lived with Dolbec, and she noted that Dolbec had referred to defendant as her boyfriend. The trial justice, after assessing the evidence of the relationship between the two, found that they indeed had been in a substantive dating relationship, noting that the length of that relationship had not been clearly established.', 'Finally, the trial justice described the frequency of the relationship noting that the parties had lived together and that defendant visited with Dolbec every evening after his workday ended. The trial justice said that she agreed with the jury’s verdict and, as a result, denied the motion. On June 10, 2011, the trial justice sentenced defendant to ten years at the ACI, three and one-half years to serve and the remainder to be suspended, with probation.', '-4-', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied both the Rule 29 and Rule 33 motions. Both arguments are premised on the same grounds: that the state failed to prove that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship as that term is defined in § 12-29-2 of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act.', 'Standard of Review', ""It is well settled that a defendant has a higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for new trial because when he renews an acquittal motion, the trial justice “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005)). In the case of a motion for new trial, however, the trial justice does not favor the state’s evidence, but “use[s] independent judgment to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Dame, 560 A.2d 330, 334 (R.I. 1989)). When faced, as here, with both Rule 29 and Rule 33 motions, “this Court first conducts a review of the new- trial motion.” See State v. Gaffney, 63 A.3d 888, 893 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 672 (R.I. 2009)). “[U]nless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640 (citing State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 1200 (R.I. 2006))."", 'At this juncture, it is important for us to note that a motion for new trial may be argued on two bases. A defendant may claim that the weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict him, or, in the alternative, he may argue that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a', '-5- conviction. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). Here, even though defendant casts his appeal as a challenge to the “sufficiency” of the evidence, his arguments and presentation of the law, both to the trial justice and to this Court, ask that his appeal be viewed through the prism of the more traditional, weight-of-the-evidence standard.', 'We previously have articulated the differing standards of review for sufficiency of the evidence versus weight of the evidence when a defendant appeals a trial justice’s denial of a motion for new trial. See State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235-36 (R.I. 2011); see also Clark, 974 A.2d at 569.', 'As set forth above, when a defendant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to serve as the basis for conviction, the trial justice does not weigh the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses, examining it instead in the light most favorable to the prosecution. See Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235. To deny the motion, the trial justice need only decide that any rational trier of fact “could have found that the prosecution established the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id.', 'On the other hand, a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence requires that “the trial justice act[] as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). We will not disturb the decision of a trial justice provided she “has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion * * * unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise', '-6- was clearly wrong.” State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Because defendant urged that the trial justice, both in the hearing on the motion for a new trial and in his brief before this Court, act as the “thirteenth juror,” we will therefore consider defendant’s appeal as a challenge to the weight of the evidence, and not as to its legal sufficiency. See Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235.', 'Discussion', 'Motion for New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she denied the motion for new trial because the evidence that the state presented did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship as defined within the “[f]amily or household member” definition in § 12-29-2. That section informs § 12-29-5 which states in paragraph (c)(1):', '“Every person convicted of an offense punishable as a', 'misdemeanor involving domestic violence as defined in § 12-29-2', 'shall:', '“* * *', '“(ii) For a third and subsequent violation be deemed guilty', 'of a felony and be imprisoned for a term of not less than one year', 'and not more than ten (10) years.” The trial justice’s finding that the parties were in fact in a domestic relationship bore particular importance because of defendant’s rather impressive record of earlier domestic violence convictions. The defendant’s criminal record reveals a disturbing pattern of domestic abuse. From 1992 until 1996, defendant had four different domestic-misdemeanor convictions. And from 1997 until 2001, he was convicted of three felony domestic-assault charges. Because of his', '-7- prior domestic-violence convictions, if the parties’ relationship was deemed to be domestic in nature, defendant would be subject to the enhanced sentencing sanctions of the statute.', 'Relevant to our discussion here, § 12-29-2(b) defines a “Family or household member” as “persons who are or have been in a substantive dating or engagement relationship within the past one year which shall be determined by the court’s consideration of the following factors:', '“(1) the length of time of the relationship;', '“(2) the type of the relationship;', '“(3) the frequence [sic] of the interaction between the parties.” 2', 'When the trial justice considered the motion, she analyzed each of the factors outlined in the statute. The evidence supported that the type of relationship was intimate in that Dolbec referred to Fleck as her boyfriend and that they lived together. Dolbec also testified that the relationship was exclusive and that defendant often accused her of being unfaithful. The trial justice noted that there was some inconsistency with the testimony regarding the length of the relationship. Dolbec testified that she was unable to remember how long she and Fleck had lived together, but that they had been together “for a few months,” and initially Dolbec told the responding officer that they had dated for five months, prompting Officer Vose to refer to Fleck as an “intimate partner” on the DVSA form. With regard to the frequency of contact, the trial justice considered that the couple lived together, that Dolbec cooked dinner for defendant every 2', 'Significantly, the definition of family or household member under G.L. 1956 § 12-29-2 also includes “adult persons who are presently residing together or who have resided together in the past three (3) years.” The testimony at trial indicated that, although Fleck maintained his own apartment, there was testimony that he was living with Dolbec at the time of the incident in question. Therefore, the parties may well have qualified as household members under the statute without need for the analysis of the domestic-relationship aspect of the definition. However, the trial justice confined her analysis to the nature of the relationship between defendant and Dolbec. Thus, we will review the appeal based on the analysis and reasoning of the trial justice.', '-8- night, and that the two always had dinner together. After reviewing the statutory factors, the trial justice found that defendant and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship. 3', 'Because the characterization of defendant and Dolbec as being in a domestic relationship was proper, we must next determine if the trial justice appropriately denied the motion for new trial. We hold that that denial was appropriate. After an exacting review of the record, it is clear to us that the trial justice conducted a thorough and complete analysis of defendant’s motion for new trial. Although defendant attempts on appeal to challenge the credibility of the complaining witness due to her cognitive deficiencies, the trial justice came to a different conclusion.', '“This Court is loath to overturn the credibility findings of a trial justice because ‘it is the trial justice who has the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this [C]ourt.’” State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 318 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Penhallow v. Penhallow, 725 A.2d 896, 897 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). In our opinion, the trial justice followed the proper procedure when considering the motion for new trial and did not overlook or misconceive material evidence. See Phannavong, 21 A.3d at 325. The trial justice’s denial of the motion for new trial was not clearly wrong, and we see no basis for disturbing her decision.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution’s case, but did not renew that motion after presenting his defense. This Court has held that we will consider an appeal for a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal only if the matter has been properly preserved. State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 444 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Tower, 984 A.2d 40, 45 3', 'On appeal, defendant asks this Court to reconsider our holding in State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326 (R.I. 2011), a recent opinion that prompted two dissents. We decline to do so. In our opinion, this case bears little resemblance to Enos.', '-9- (R.I. 2009)). “We consistently have held that the failure to renew a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence forecloses the defendant’s right to appeal the denial.” Tower, 984 A.2d at 45. Therefore, the defendant’s Rule 29 motion has been waived. However, even if the motion had been preserved, it would have provided no relief to the defendant because we have affirmed the Superior Court with respect to the Rule 33 motion for new trial. In any event, we would not consider his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal because any such review is unnecessary. See Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640; see also Cardona, 969 A.2d at 672 (noting that when this Court simultaneously faces a defendant’s challenge to the trial court’s rulings on motions for new trial and judgment of acquittal, we first conduct “the more exacting analysis required for review of a ruling on a motion for a new trial”).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction in this case.

90,State : v. : Christian Buchanan. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Christian Buchanan (defendant or Buchanan), is before this Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction on one count of first- degree child molestation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1, and three counts of second- degree child molestation in violation of § 11-37-8.3. In support of his appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice abused her discretion in refusing to exclude all evidence of uncharged acts of molestation, and that she erred in denying the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The events giving rise to this case began in 1996 when Buchanan met then six-year-old K.B.1 At the time, K.B. resided with her mother and her two sisters in a second-floor apartment of a multifamily home located in Fall River, Massachusetts. Buchanan frequently visited his uncle who lived nearby, and he became friendly with K.B. and the other neighborhood children, 1', 'For the sake of privacy, the complainant has been given a pseudonym, and members of her immediate family will be referred to by their first names.', '-1- with whom he played games, such as soccer and basketball.', 'This relationship changed, however, after Buchanan began to date K.B.’s mother, Amy. In April 2000, Buchanan moved into the first of a series of homes in which K.B.’s family resided, located on Cottage Avenue in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. K.B. shared a second-floor bedroom with her younger sister, Emily; her older sister, Susan, occupied another bedroom on the second floor, and Buchanan and Amy shared a bedroom on the first floor. K.B. testified that she was opposed to Buchanan moving in with her family and that she felt Buchanan was trying to take the place of her biological father, who had left when K.B. was only four days old. K.B. made her feelings known to Amy, including the fact that Buchanan was closer in age to her older sister Susan than he was to her mother.', 'These were not the only reasons for K.B.’s animus, however. K.B. testified that there were at least two instances—occurring shortly after Buchanan moved to Cottage Avenue—when he came to her room in the middle of the night. According to K.B., during the first incident, Buchanan awakened her and began rubbing lotion onto her back and buttocks. During this encounter, the child—who was ten years old at the time—did not say or do anything, and faced away from Buchanan. Later, Buchanan explained to K.B. that he had given her a massage. K.B. also described another instance when Buchanan entered her room in the middle of the night and rubbed lotion onto her back, buttocks, and chest. After these episodes, Buchanan admonished K.B. not to tell her mother; he also plied the child with candy or large sums of money, often between $75 to $100 in cash.', 'In January 2002, when K.B. was almost twelve, the family, including Buchanan, moved to a three-bedroom home on Chestnut Hill Road in Middletown, Rhode Island, where K.B. again shared a bedroom with her younger sister. K.B. testified that approximately one month after', '-2- moving to this address, Buchanan resumed visiting her room in the middle of the night and rubbing lotion on her back, buttocks, legs, and chest. It was during the time the family lived at this location that Buchanan also began to touch and penetrate K.B.’s vagina with his finger, and showed her his penis. K.B. would remain silent during these incidents and did not disclose these events to anyone. In fact, the child never told anyone about Buchanan’s abuse, despite a pointed inquiry by the mother of her best friend, who saw K.B. with large sums of cash. Amy also testified that she noticed money missing from Buchanan’s paycheck “at least once a month.”', 'Less than two years later, K.B. and her family moved again, this time to a two-family home on Chase Road in Portsmouth, where K.B. had her own room. Although K.B.’s mother and defendant married while the family lived at this address, Buchanan nevertheless continued to molest K.B., and visited her room in the middle of the night to rub lotion onto her back, buttocks, legs, and breasts. However, these visits stopped after K.B. turned seventeen and her family moved yet again, this time to Coral Street in Portsmouth. K.B. testified that she “finally got the guts to stand up for myself,” because she “knew more of what was going on, [and that] what he was doing was wrong.” She testified that “I just didn’t take it anymore” and “I just didn’t let anything happen. Eventually it stopped.”', 'By the time the molestations ended, however, K.B.’s relationship with her mother had deteriorated significantly. K.B. testified that she blamed her mother for bringing Buchanan into their lives, and felt that her mother had to have known what Buchanan had done to her. The child repeatedly asked her mother for permission to move away from home, and Amy refused. Nonetheless, K.B. made plans to move in with her boyfriend’s family shortly after her eighteenth birthday.', 'On April 8, 2008, Dwayne Arruda, her boyfriend’s father, arrived at the family’s home,', '-3- now located in Tiverton, Rhode Island, to collect K.B. and her belongings. Upon arrival he discovered, contrary to what he was led to believe, that K.B. was not being forced to leave home, because Amy was asking K.B. why she felt she had to move out. K.B. told her mother flatly that it was because of Buchanan, who was standing nearby, in silence. Once she was safely in Arruda’s truck, a hysterical K.B. disclosed that Buchanan had molested her over the course of seven years. Although K.B. did not tell her mother about the abuse prior to her departure, she left a handwritten letter in her mother’s car, in which she disclosed Buchanan’s sexual assaults. When Amy retrieved the letter from the car, she read it, confronted Buchanan, and called the police.', 'Deputy Chief Jeffrey Furtado (Chief Furtado) of the Portsmouth Police Department2 testified that on April 11, 2008, he was notified that the Tiverton police had responded to a domestic disturbance in that town and a preliminary investigation revealed that instances of child molestation may have occurred years earlier in Portsmouth, and that the suspect was at the police station. Acting Det. Sergeant Scott Travers (Det. Travers) responded to the Tiverton police station and asked Buchanan if he would accompany him to the Portsmouth Police Department. Buchanan agreed, and the pair traveled to the Portsmouth police station.', 'Meanwhile, K.B. appeared at the Portsmouth Police Department to formally complain about Buchanan’s conduct. She alleged that Buchanan had touched her inappropriately over the course of seven years. When Buchanan arrived at the police station, he was informed that his stepdaughter had made allegations of sexual abuse against him. According to Chief Furtado, defendant appeared remorseful and acknowledged that he had a problem and needed help. Chief Furtado testified that Buchanan then asked, “What do you want to know? And where do you 2', 'At the time, Deputy Chief Furtado held the rank of Detective Lieutenant and was in charge of the detective division of the Portsmouth Police Department.', '-4- want me to start?”', 'The defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and signed and initialed a prepared rights form.3 Buchanan then proceeded to detail how he began abusing K.B. shortly after he moved into the Cottage Avenue home and continued until approximately 2007, when the family moved to Coral Street. Buchanan recounted that when he first began molesting K.B., it would occur a couple of times a week. According to Buchanan, the abuse continued at this pace after the family moved to Middletown, but that when the family moved back to Portsmouth, it occurred approximately twice a month.', 'After giving an oral statement, defendant agreed to a written confession. At 3:30 p.m.— twenty minutes after arriving at the police station and ten minutes after signing the rights form— Buchanan provided a handwritten statement to police. Upon reviewing that written statement, Chief Furtado noted that Buchanan had left out certain details that he had previously disclosed, including digital penetration. Chief Furtado asked Buchanan to include these details in his written statement, and Buchanan obliged. However, the amended statement was difficult to read, so Chief Furtado then asked Buchanan to provide another statement that included all relevant facts. The defendant complied.', 'Because Buchanan admitted to molesting K.B. when the family lived in Middletown, Lt. John Gatta (Lt. Gatta) of the Middletown Police Department was contacted and arrived at the Portsmouth station to interview defendant. This second interview—which lasted no more than a half hour—began by Lt. Gatta once again going over Buchanan’s Miranda rights. Buchanan then proceeded to provide a verbal and a written statement to Lt. Gatta, again describing how, when the family resided in Middletown, he repeatedly molested K.B., including by digital 3', 'The question of the voluntariness of defendant’s statements to police is not before us on appeal.', '-5- penetration.', 'Buchanan subsequently was charged by criminal indictment with three counts of second- degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4. Specifically, count 1 detailed sexual contact—rubbing K.B.’s buttocks—on a date between April 1, 2000 and September 1, 2000 in the town of Portsmouth. Count 2 charged sexual contact, specifically, buttocks contact, and count 3 alleged breast contact, both occurring between January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002 in Middletown. Finally, count 4 of the indictment charged first-degree child molestation sexual assault—digital penetration—in violation of § 11-37-8.1 and § 11-37-8.2, between January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002 in Middletown.', 'Prior to trial, Buchanan sought pretrial in limine rulings to exclude evidence in accordance with Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Specifically, Buchanan sought to prohibit evidence relating to instances of uncharged sexual misconduct. Defense counsel argued that, because the allegations charged in the indictment—and clarified in the bill of particulars—were limited to a two-year time frame, evidence of molestations occurring over a seven-year span would be unduly prejudicial.4 This motion was granted in part; the trial justice ruled that evidence of any uncharged acts of molestation committed against K.B. would be limited to the time frame set forth in the indictment and the bill of particulars. The trial justice also ordered the redaction of any uncharged acts of molestation described in the letter from K.B. 4', 'Buchanan also sought to exclude evidence concerning a separate criminal case in which he was charged with committing three counts of second-degree child molestation upon an unrelated child while working as a school bus monitor in Middletown in 2002. Although the case resulted in Buchanan pleading nolo contendere to three amended charges of simple assault in 2003, defense counsel argued that introduction of such evidence also would be unduly prejudicial under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The trial justice ruled that the prosecution was prohibited from introducing evidence related to the earlier criminal case but left open the possibility that such evidence could be used for purposes of impeachment or rebuttal if introduced by the defense.', '-6- to her mother.5', 'However, on the morning of trial the state indicated that it had supplemented its discovery responses.', 'According to the state, after a meeting with K.B. days earlier, K.B. disclosed additional acts of sexual molestation, including uncharged acts of digital penetration that occurred both after and during the time period listed in the indictment and bill of particulars.6 The trial justice again prohibited the prosecution from introducing any evidence of uncharged acts of digital penetration; however, the court amended its earlier ruling to the limited extent that testimony and evidence related to conduct admitted by Buchanan in his verbal and written statements to police were admissible.', 'After the state rested its case, defense counsel’s motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 2, 3, and 4 was denied by the trial justice. At the end of a five-day trial, the trial justice gave the following instructions concerning evidence of uncharged acts of sexual molestation:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, in this case you did hear evidence from the', 'alleged victim, of conduct unrelated to these four offenses.', 'Evidence of other acts or bad acts so-called, or crimes, may not be', 'considered by you to prove that the defendant has a propensity for', 'sexual offenses.

A few days after her initial departure from the family home, she returned to collect the rest of her belongings and discovered that the notebook was missing. The trial justice ruled that testimony relating to the notebook was admissible but prohibited any questioning or speculation as to whether defendant was involved in its disappearance. This ruling has not been challenged on appeal.', '-7- The defendant filed a motion for a new trial that was heard and denied by the trial justice on August 31, 2011.

Merida, 960 A.2d at 238. Because the inherent purpose of a motion in limine “is to ‘prevent the proponent of potentially prejudicial matter from displaying it to the jury * * * in any manner', '-9- until the trial court has ruled upon its admissibility in the context of the trial itself[,]’” Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1212 (quoting State v.

Furthermore, defendant did not object when his statements to police—referencing uncharged acts of molestation—were introduced into evidence, nor during Chief Furtado’s testimony about defendant’s admissions.

For the reasons explained below, we reject these arguments.', 'In reviewing a challenge to a trial justice’s rulings on a motion for judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial, this Court “first conducts a review of the new-trial motion.” State v.

On appeal, this Court employs a standard of review based on the weight of the evidence, which is also the standard advocated in defendant’s brief. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569-70 (R.I. 2009) (explaining the difference between the standard utilized when this Court reviews a motion for a new trial based on weight of the evidence, as opposed to insufficiency of the evidence).', '- 11 - Scurry, 636 A.2d 719, 725 (R.I. 1994)).

The trial justice recounted how K.B. testified in great detail as to her age, her grade in school, and where the family was living from the time she met defendant until the molestations stopped when she turned seventeen.', 'The trial justice also referenced the complainant’s testimony as to the manner and timing of the abuse she endured, finding it to fit squarely within the time frame listed in the bill of particulars. Moreover, the trial justice specifically found that the girl’s testimony “was nothing but credible,” and noted that her testimony “could only emanate from someone who really and truly experienced and endured the assaults that she was subjected to.” Finally, the trial justice declared that—even without taking into account the additional corroborative testimony of others and defendant’s own confession— the charges against defendant were proven beyond a reasonable doubt based on K.B.’s testimony alone. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice conducted an appropriate review of the evidence presented at trial, did not overlook or misconceive material and relevant evidence, and provided sufficient reasoning to support her decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'We also deem unavailing defendant’s contention that a new trial should have been granted based on comments made by the prosecutor concerning defendant looking at his attorney while testifying. Although the record reflects that—during the cross-examination of defendant— the prosecutor twice asked him why he was looking to his attorney before answering a question, the record also reveals that the trial justice admonished the prosecutor in the presence of the jury, and later gave a limiting instruction specifically requested by defendant concerning this perceived communication.11 Notably, although defendant raised this issue before the trial justice 11', 'After the second occasion when the prosecutor suggested that defendant was looking at counsel, the trial justice stated in open court, “[Prosecutor], this is his lawyer. They have a confidential relationship and you will refrain from any commentary regarding any interaction,', '- 13 - in the motion for the new trial, it is undisputed that defendant did not move to pass the case, nor did he pose an objection to the limiting instruction given by the trial justice.

In a fairly typical mortgage transaction, the plaintiff, Christopher Reynolds, executed a promissory note, secured by a mortgage on his property. Unfortunately, Reynolds defaulted on the loan, which in time led to foreclosure proceedings. Reynolds filed for bankruptcy, which prompted the then holder of the mortgage to seek relief from the automatic stay imposed by bankruptcy law. Indeed, relief from the stay was given in two separate bankruptcy cases filed by Reynolds, the second of which was initiated after a foreclosure sale had been completed. Reynolds then filed a declaratory-judgment action in Superior Court. Eventually, a justice of the Superior Court granted summary judgment based on the doctrine of res judicata, a decision that Reynolds appealed to this Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 29, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.

Capital Industries, Inc., 113 R.I. 292, 298, 320 A.2d 604, 607 (1974), we considered whether res judicata precluded a party from relitigating in state court issues that had already been litigated in United States Bankruptcy Court. We said that, to apply res judicata, “it must be shown that either the matter controverted in the second action was raised and litigated in the [earlier] proceedings * * * or that the matter, if not raised, was one which could and should have been brought forward and litigated.” Id. (quoting 3 Collier, Bankruptcy ¶ 57.14[7] at 221- 23 (14th ed. 1974)). In that case, a claim had been disallowed in the bankruptcy proceeding, the', '-6- federal district court entered an order of confirmation, and we held that res judicata precluded the relitigation of the matter in a state court proceeding. Id.', 'Applying those principles to the case before us, there can be little doubt that there is identity of the parties, as Reynolds was the debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings, thereby voluntarily subjecting himself to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Also, Deutsche Bank filed the motion for relief from the stay, the granting of which is the focus of this case. Settipane purchased the property at the foreclosure sale and received title to the property from Deutsche Bank by means of a foreclosure deed that was recorded on May 14, 2010. Settipane’s purchase of the property places him in privity with Deutsche Bank, which “sufficiently represent[ed]” Settipane’s interest when it sought relief from the stay prior to the foreclosure sale in the Chapter 7 case and also sought retrospective relief from the stay after the sale to Settipane in the Chapter 13 case. See Lennon, 901 A.2d at 591 (quoting Duffy, 896 A.2d at 36).', 'Similarly, the issues were the same in the bankruptcy proceedings and in the Superior Court. Motions for relief from the stay were considered in both the Chapter 7 proceeding and the Chapter 13 proceeding. In his objection to the latter motion, Reynolds said that relief from the stay was improper because Deutsche Bank’s “claim [wa]s based on a defective title resulting from an unauthorized MERS assignment of mortgage,” and because Deutsche Bank “d[id] not possess the mortgage note and ha[d] not recorded an assignment of mortgage on the land evidence records * * * .” Additionally, that motion was filed, heard, and decided after the foreclosure sale had taken place, and the order resolving the issue provided that the foreclosure sale “was a valid sale, [and] remain[ed] in full force and effect.” Thus, Deutsche Bank’s right to foreclose on the property and the validity of the foreclosure sale were considered and decided by', '-7- the bankruptcy court, satisfying the second element of res judicata. See E.W. Audet & Sons, Inc., 635 A.2d at 1186; DiSaia, 113 R.I. at 298, 320 A.2d at 607.', 'It is our opinion as well that the judgment on which Deutsche Bank and Settipane rely was final for res judicata purposes. In DiSaia, 113 R.I. at 297, 320 A.2d at 606, we said that if a creditor “was dissatisfied with the order of disallowance, his remedy was by way of an appeal of that order under the Bankruptcy Act.” The same is true here. However, Reynolds did not seek review of the bankruptcy court’s order that granted ex post relief from the stay in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy and confirmed that the foreclosure sale “was a valid sale, [and] remain[ed] in full force and effect.” The bankruptcy has now concluded, and the decision, unappealed, is final.', 'Nonetheless, Reynolds argues that the bankruptcy court’s decision to grant relief from the stay was merely procedural in nature and that the issue decided in that proceeding was not the same as the issue being considered in this case. In support of his argument, plaintiff relies on Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, 42 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1994), a case in which the First Circuit Court of Appeals refused to give preclusive effect to a bankruptcy court’s decision to grant relief from the automatic stay. We conclude, however, that that case is distinguishable.', 'In Grella, 42 F.3d at 28, a debtor signed a promissory note in favor of a bank and collaterally assigned promissory notes and mortgages to the bank to secure the debt. The debtor later filed for bankruptcy, and the bank sought and obtained relief from the stay. Id. The bank then sought a determination of the status of its liens, and the bankruptcy trustee raised a preference counterclaim. 4', 'The bankruptcy court ruled that the trustee’s counterclaim was precluded. Id. at 30. 4', 'The trustee alleged that the bank’s interest in one particular piece of collateral was “avoidable as a preferential transfer.” Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 1994). “A ‘preference’ is a transfer of a debtor’s assets during a specified pre-bankruptcy period', '-8-', 'On appeal, the First Circuit held that the bankruptcy court’s decision to grant relief from the stay “is merely a summary proceeding of limited effect,” which is a “determin[ation of] whether the party seeking relief has a colorable claim to property of the estate.” Grella, 42 F.3d at 33. Relief from the stay “is not a determination of the validity of those claims, but merely a grant of permission from the court allowing th[e] creditor to litigate its substantive claims elsewhere without violating the automatic stay.” Id. at 33-34.', 'Despite plaintiff’s arguments to the contrary, however, we do not believe Grella to be persuasive here. First, we note that the foreclosure sale in this case had taken place already when the bankruptcy court entered its order in the Chapter 13 case. That order specifically said that the sale to Settipane was “valid [and] remain[ed] in full force and effect.” In Grella, 42 F.3d at 33-34, the court explained that relief from the stay means that a creditor may “litigate its substantive claims elsewhere without violating the automatic stay”; here, Deutsche Bank already had exercised its foreclosure rights, and the bankruptcy court essentially ratified the sale when it lifted the stay. Thus, Reynolds’s reliance on any preliminary nature of the bankruptcy court’s decision granting relief from stay in his case is misplaced, especially because his bankruptcy cases have concluded. In Grella, 42 F.3d at 29-30, the court was considering a counterclaim that was not raised in response to a motion for relief from the stay but was raised later in the bankruptcy proceedings.', 'Additionally, the court in Grella, 42 F.3d at 31-32, considered issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, rather than claim preclusion. As that court explained, issue preclusion “bars that unjustifiably favors the transferee over other creditors.” Id. at 29 n.5 (citing In re Melon Produce, Inc., 976 F.2d 71, 73 (1st Cir. 1992)). “Section 547 [of title 11 of the United States Code] allows a bankruptcy trustee, in certain circumstances, to avoid preferential transfers of an interest of the debtor if the transfer was made within 90 days before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.” Id.', '-9- relitigation of any factual or legal issue that was actually decided in previous litigation ‘between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.’” Id. at 30 (quoting Dennis v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust, 744 F.2d 893, 899 (1st Cir. 1984)). The elements of issue preclusion are', '“(1) the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as that', 'involved in the prior action; (2) the issue must have been actually', 'litigated; (3) the issue must have been determined by a valid and', 'binding final judgment; and (4) the determination of the issue must', 'have been essential to the judgment.” Id. 5', 'The summary nature of a hearing on a motion for relief from stay may be implicated when applying issue preclusion because that doctrine requires the issue to have been “actually * * * litigated” and “necessarily * * * decided.” 6 See E.W. Audet & Sons, Inc., 635 A.2d at 1186 (citing State v. Chase, 588 A.2d 120, 123 (R.I. 1991)). The bank in Grella argued that the bankruptcy court must have found that its security interest was valid because such a finding was a prerequisite to lifting the stay, but the court disagreed, holding that the lien’s validity was not “actually adjudicated” because obtaining relief from the stay required only a colorable claim. Grella, 42 F.3d at 34. Here, the propriety of the foreclosure was examined by the bankruptcy court after the foreclosure sale had taken place; that court said that the sale was valid, and the 5', 'The elements outlined by the First Circuit in Grella are essentially the same as those required to apply issue preclusion under our law.

McGovern, 113 R.I. 169, 172, 319 A.2d 358, 361 (1974)). As we said in an earlier decision, the application of issue preclusion requires “that the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits,” “that the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted be the same as or in privity with a party in the prior proceeding[,]” and “that there be an identity of issues.” Id. (citing State v. Chase, 588 A.2d 120, 122 (R.I. 1991)). We have further “subdivided” the “identity of issues” element as requiring that “(1) the issue sought to be precluded must be identical to the issue determined in the earlier proceeding, (2) the issue must actually have been litigated in the prior proceeding, and (3) the issue must necessarily have been decided.” Id. (citing Chase, 588 A.2d at 123). 6', 'Claim preclusion, in contrast, does not require that the issue to be precluded has actually been litigated or necessarily decided.

The defendant, the State of Rhode Island (State), appeals from the entry of partial summary judgment in the Superior Court for the plaintiff, the Narragansett Indian Tribe (Tribe), finding that the plaintiff had standing to pursue a constitutional challenge to the 2011 Casino Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-61.2-2.1, as enacted by P.L. 2011, ch. 151, art. 25, § 2. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 4, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The matter came before the Superior Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. The Superior Court granted partial summary judgment for defendant finding that the 2011 Casino Act was facially constitutional. The Tribe has appealed that decision on the merits to this Court, No. 2012-322-Appeal, but the Tribe’s appeal is not before us in the instant decision.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The underlying facts of this case are undisputed. The plaintiff, Narragansett Indian Tribe, is a group of Native Americans indigenous to the land that is now the state of Rhode Island. In 1880, the General Assembly disestablished the Tribe, leaving it with only two acres of its reservation.', 'Over the course of the next century, the Tribe and the state engaged in a series of disputes wherein the Tribe attempted to regain the tribal lands that it had lost. At length, in 1978, the dispute was settled by means of a Joint Memorandum of Understanding (JMOU), codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 1701 through 1716, which was signed by the Tribe, then-Rhode Island Governor J. Joseph Garrahy, the Charlestown Town Council, and certain landowners. The JMOU transferred 1,800 acres in Charlestown back to the Tribe in the form of a trust in exchange for the Tribe’s agreement that the transferred acres would remain subject to the laws, regulations, and jurisdiction of the state, with the exception of hunting, fishing, and taxation. The Tribe, as the only federally recognized Native American tribe in the state, has been recognized as an independent sovereign entity to be accorded due dignity and respect. See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State of Rhode Island, 449 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2006).', 'In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701 through 2721, which made Class II gaming, as defined in the IGRA, subject to regulation by the National Indian Gaming Commission (Commission). The IGRA permitted federally recognized tribes to apply to the Commission for approval of gaming proposals. Accordingly, the Tribe attempted to establish a gaming facility pursuant to the IGRA, which was opposed by the state. A series of legal skirmishes between the Tribe and the state precipitated by the Tribe’s desire to', '-2- open a gaming facility led to then-Senator John H. Chafee attaching an amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1996, which amended the JMOU to clarify that the Tribe’s lands returned to it under the JMOU were not to be treated as Indian lands for the purposes of the IGRA.', 'This Court has twice been asked to issue advisory opinions concerning proposed legislation in the Tribe’s ongoing efforts to establish gaming in Rhode Island and has found that the proposed legislation contained constitutional defects. See In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor (Casino I), 856 A.2d 320 (R.I. 2004) and In re Advisory Opinion to the House of Representatives (Casino II), 885 A.2d 698 (R.I. 2005). Following these attempts, in 2006, the Tribe also proposed an amendment to the Rhode Island Constitution in an attempt to establish gaming, which was defeated in a voter referendum.', 'Twin River 2 and Newport Grand are state-licensed gambling venues in the state of Rhode Island where video lottery terminal (VLT) machines are presently utilized. By statute, the Tribe is entitled to receive 0.17 percent of net terminal income from the authorized VLT machines at Twin River up to a maximum of $10,000,000 per year.

On October 26, 2011, UTGR, Inc. d/b/a Twin River (UTGR) filed a motion to intervene as a defendant, which was granted on January 6, 2012.', 'The parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment, both of which came before the Washington County Superior Court for hearing on May 30, 2012. The hearing justice issued a written decision on June 29, 2012, which found that plaintiff did have standing but that plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Casino Acts violate a provision of the Rhode Island Constitution. Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motions for partial summary judgment on July 10, 2012.', 'The plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court on the hearing justice’s grant of defendants’ motions on July 23, 2012.

We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See id. “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Swain v.

The state further insists that the hearing justice erred in finding that the public interest exception to the injury-in- fact requirement for standing applied.', 'Standing is a threshold inquiry into whether the party seeking relief is entitled to bring suit. See Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utilities Commission, 452 A.2d 6', 'Significantly, intervenor-defendant, UTGR, does not contest the Tribe’s standing in this case.', '-5- 931, 932, 933 (R.I. 1982). When standing is challenged, “the focal point shifts to the claimant, not the claim, and a court must determine if the plaintiff ‘whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable’ * * *.” McKenna v. Williams, 874 A.2d 217, 226 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99-100 (1968)). As this Court has stated, “[t]he essence of the question of standing is whether the party seeking relief has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure concrete adverseness that sharpens the presentation of the issues upon which the court depends for an illumination of the questions presented.” Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce, 452 A.2d at 933.', 'In determining whether a party has standing, a court begins with the pivotal question of whether the party alleges that the challenged action has caused him or her injury in fact. See Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856, 862 (R.I. 1997). This Court has required that the alleged injury in fact must be “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized * * * and (b) actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’” Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). In Rhode Island, “generalized claims alleging purely public harm are an insufficient basis for sustaining a private lawsuit.” Watson v. Fox, 44 A.3d 130, 136 (R.I. 2012). Moreover, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that “[t]he line is not between a substantial injury and an insubstantial injury. The line is between injury and no injury.” Pontbriand, 699 A.2d at 862 (quoting Matunuck Beach Hotel, Inc. v. Sheldon, 121 R.I. 386, 396, 399 A.2d 489, 494 (1979)). On rare occasions, however, this Court will overlook the standing requirement by invoking the so-called “substantial public interest” exception in order to decide the merits of a case of substantial public importance. See, e.g., Burns v. Sundlun, 617 A.2d 114, 116 (R.I. 1992) (invoking the public interest exception where', '-6- “[t]he plaintiff raise[d] a question of statutory interpretation of great importance to citizens in localities that could become home to gambling facilities seeking to simulcast and invite wagering on out-of-state events”).', 'The state argues that the Tribe has not demonstrated that it has suffered an injury in fact distinguishable from any injury suffered by the public at large. We find the state’s contention to be without merit. The Tribe bases its argument of an injury in fact on its statutory right to receive 0.17 percent of the net terminal income from the authorized VLT machines. The parties did not dispute at oral argument that, as a result of the proposed establishment of table games at Twin River, some 200 VLT machines have been removed. The state contends that it is by no means certain that the Tribe will, in fact, suffer any reduction in income from the removal of the machines. The state avers that the expected increase in traffic to the Twin River establishment due to the new table games will offset the reduction in the number of machines. We are not persuaded by the state’s argument. On the contrary, we conclude that it is reasonable to expect that a consequence of there being 200 fewer VLT machines may well be a reduction in the net terminal income from the machines. Moreover, while it is true the injury in fact for standing may not be purely conjectural or hypothetical, we nevertheless have not required that plaintiffs be able to demonstrate with absolute certainty that they have already suffered an injury. See Haviland v. Simmons, 45 A.3d 1246, 1257 (R.I. 2012) (holding that the uncertainty of the plaintiff’s contractual status with her employer was a “concrete and particularized interest” sufficient to give the plaintiff standing to sue). The reasonable likelihood that the Tribe will suffer a reduction in income from the removal of the VLT machines is sufficient to support a finding that the Tribe has suffered an injury in fact.', '-7-', 'In so holding, we emphasize as well that the Tribe does not need to have alleged that its loss in income from the removal of the machines will be a substantial one. As we have previously stated, the requirement for standing is only that plaintiffs have suffered an injury, not that the injury be substantial. See Pontbriand, 699 A.2d at 862. We note, however, that the loss of some 200 VLT machines as individual sources of income is not a trivial one. While the lure of the table games at Twin River might cause some new patrons to also try their luck at the VLT machines, these new patrons will have significantly fewer machines at which they might play.', 'The Tribe urges this Court to find, as did the hearing justice, that the instant matter also involves a question of substantial public interest. We note that this Court has generally been reluctant to invoke the public interest exception, which is reserved for rare circumstances. See Watson, 44 A.3d at 138; In re Review of Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 19 A.3d 1226, 1229 (R.I. 2011) (mem.). Accordingly, because we hold that the Tribe has demonstrated an injury in fact, we need not, and do not, reach the question of whether this qualifies within the public interest exception to standing. In so doing, we exercise our prerogative of affirming the hearing justice’s finding for a different reason. See Levine v. Bess Eaton Donut Flour Co., 705 A.2d 980, 984 (R.I. 1998) (holding that the Supreme Court can affirm a trial justice’s decision for reasons other than those relied upon by the trial justice).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Tribe was entitled to bring its claims challenging the Casino Acts. Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court finding that the Tribe had standing is affirmed.

The petitioner then appealed the building official’s denial to the zoning board and, alternatively, applied for a dimensional variance. The zoning board denied both the petitioner’s appeal and his request for a dimensional variance, and the Superior Court affirmed.

When the town adopted a zoning ordinance on December 30, 1965, it implemented the tax assessor’s map as the zoning ordinance map.

Art. IX(43)(a). Reading these two definitions together, the zoning board concluded that “a lot must possess frontage although there is no minimum dimension.” The zoning board reasoned that because the unimproved lot is landlocked, it has “no lot line that exists along a street right-of-way, thus, [it] has no frontage * * * .” The zoning board therefore upheld the building official’s denial of a building permit.', 'other subdivision of land, no lot area shall be reduced below the', 'dimensional requirements prescribed for the district in which the', 'lot is located.” 5', 'The petitioner did not appeal the other deficiencies to the zoning board, and thus those issues were not before the Superior Court.', '-4-', 'In addition to denying petitioner’s appeal, the zoning board also denied petitioner’s application for a height and width dimensional variance. 6 The zoning board found that it was petitioner’s application for a subdivision to the plan commission in 2006 that resulted in the landlocked unimproved lot, thereby creating the hardship, i.e., the lack of frontage, necessitating the variance.

We have also applied the principle of judicial estoppel to zoning cases. See Pascalides v.

The trial justice specified the following items of evidence available to the zoning board: the 1965 zoning map depicting petitioner’s parcel as a single lot; petitioner’s deed describing the parcel as “a certain lot or tract of woodland”; petitioner’s 1983 testimony before the zoning board in which he referred to the parcel in the singular as “it” and “his lot”; and the ownership history of the parcel.

State, 63 A.3d 526, 530 (R.I. 2013), and we conclude that the evidence before the zoning board was simply too tenuous to support the application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel under the circumstances of this case. We first note that the 1965 zoning map is irrelevant to the inquiry of how petitioner treated the parcel in question. The adoption of the zoning ordinance and corresponding maps predate petitioner’s acquisition of the parcel by over sixteen years, and there is no evidence in the record suggesting that any of his predecessors in title affirmatively sought to merge the two lots. Moreover, both petitioner and the zoning board acknowledge that the zoning ordinance has never contained a merger provision and that, therefore, the two lots did not merge by operation of law.', 'We also conclude that the deeds to the property are of little assistance. Although it is true that all deeds from 1929 on describe the property in the singular as “a certain lot or tract of woodland,” they also consistently identify the property as consisting of “two certain lots of land” as depicted in the Ezekiel Bishop plat map. 11 11', 'Although this Court has not specifically decided whether verbal or written property descriptions trump a reference to a plat map, we have addressed deed description and lot designation generally.

We initially observe that it is somewhat of a misnomer to characterize the evidence before the zoning board as petitioner’s “testimony.” The evidence in question is the minutes of the zoning board meeting of October 25, 1983, at which the board considered the application of Serafino and Anna Raponi. The minutes do not purport to contain a verbatim transcription of petitioner’s presentation, although they do indicate that the proceedings were tape-recorded and that petitioner was sworn.', 'Rather, the minutes summarize petitioner’s “testimony,” in total, as follows:', '“[Petitioner] (sworn in) said he wants to purchase a 50′ strip of', 'land to have access to his 9 acres which is land locked [sic].

We agree with petitioner that a casual reference to his property by the word “it” in this context does not constitute an assertion that he owned the entire 9.09-acre parcel as a single lot.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the zoning board’s decision that petitioner “clearly believed that he had a single 9.09 acre parcel in 1983.” We hold, therefore, that the trial justice erred by applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel to prevent petitioner from arguing that his property always existed as two separate lots.', 'B', 'Merger', 'We turn next to petitioner’s contention that the unimproved lot and the improved lot are two separate, lawfully created lots that have never merged. The petitioner argues that the parcel has always consisted of two lots because “[n]o evidence exists that any owner voluntarily merged the lots and the Zoning Ordinance does not contain a merger provision.” We agree.', 'Cities and towns in Rhode Island have the power to promulgate and regulate the merger of contiguous lots by “specify[ing] the standards, on a district by district basis, which determine the mergers.” Section 45-24-38. Both petitioner and the zoning board acknowledge that the Scituate Zoning Ordinance does not contain a merger provision. Because Scituate does not have a provision for the merger of contiguous properties, in order to merge such lots, a property owner must apply for a subdividision. Scituate, Code of Ordinances, ch. 14, art. II, sec. 14-27. 12 The subdivision and land regulations of the Town of Scituate require a landowner to submit a proposal to the plan commission and gain approval before subdividing or merging his property. 12', '“Any adjustment to existing lot lines of a recorded lot by any means shall be considered a subdivision.” Scituate, Code of Ordinances, ch. 14, art. II, sec. 14-27.', '- 12 - Id. sec. 14-28(a). 13 Therefore, in the absence of a merger provision or an affirmative act by a landowner to merge his or her property, two lots do not merge automatically.', 'It does not appear to us that there was substantial evidence before the zoning board demonstrating that the two lots, as depicted on the 1848 plat map, ever merged. The zoning board seemingly recognized that the property originally consisted of two lots that at some point in time had merged. As the zoning board explained, “the record of evidence is not clear as to whether or not the two smaller lots were merged by [petitioner] or his predecessors in title.” Additionally, all of the six deeds submitted to the zoning board contained the contradictory language “a certain lot or tract of woodland * * * comprised of those two certain lots of land.”', 'In her decision, the trial justice affirmed the zoning board’s finding that petitioner created his own hardship by applying for a subdivision in 2006 and creating a landlocked lot. However, as petitioner correctly contends, but for the purported merger, he would not have needed to appear before the plan commission in 2006 to subdivide his property, 14 and, therefore, he could not have created his own hardship by subdividing property that already consisted of two lots. Because the trial justice never addressed this contention in her first decision, petitioner again raised the issue in a motion for reconsideration, which the trial justice granted. However, after reconsideration, the trial justice once again failed to address the merger issue, instead focusing her analysis on the “ample evidence on the record that supports the [z]oning [b]oard’s finding that [petitioner] treated his property as one lot.” Based largely on petitioner’s 1983 appearance 13', 'Section 14-28(a) provides, in pertinent part:', '“There shall be no subdivision (as defined herein and in Title 45,', 'Chapter 23 of the General Laws) of any lot, tract or parcel of land', 'within the town * * * without the prior submission to, and approval', 'of, the Plan Commission of a plan of such subdivision * * * .” 14', 'The petitioner claims that he appeared before the plan commission “to correct the administrative mistake the Scituate Tax Assessor made depicting [his] two (2) lots on its tax map as only one (1) parcel.”', '- 13 - before the zoning board in which he described his property by the singular pronoun “it,” the trial justice concluded that he “represented his land as a single parcel.” The trial justice then stated that whether “the 9.09 acre parcel actually consisted of one or two separate lots dating back to 1848, is of no importan[ce] to this matter * * *,” and proceeded to invoke the doctrine of judicial estoppel to prevent petitioner from advancing his merger argument.', 'As discussed supra, we are satisfied that the trial justice abused her discretion by applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel and preventing petitioner from arguing that his property has always existed as two separate lots. Moreover, we are of the opinion that there was not substantial evidence before the zoning board to support its findings that the two lots had merged (either by petitioner or by a predecessor in title) and that petitioner “clearly believed that he had a single 9.09 acre parcel.” Accordingly, we are satisfied that the record demonstrates that petitioner’s property originally consisted of two lots, as depicted in the 1848 plat map, and that there is not substantial evidence that they were ever merged.', 'C', 'Frontage Requirement', 'The petitioner argues that the zoning ordinance does not mandate a frontage requirement and that the zoning board’s interpretation of the ordinance imposing such a requirement was in error. The zoning ordinance requires that residential properties in zoning district RR-120 meet certain requirements for the following dimensions: lot size; lot width; front yard depth; side yard depth; rear yard depth; building coverage; and building height. Scituate Zoning Ordinance, App. A, art. III, § 1. A key issue in this case is the width of petitioner’s unimproved lot. In upholding the building official’s denial of a building permit, the zoning board found that the unimproved lot does not meet the ordinance’s minimum 300-foot width requirement. The board made this', '- 14 - determination despite the fact that the unimproved lot contains over 700 feet of horizontal distance between its two side lines. 15', 'To reach this conclusion, the board looked to the definitions section of the ordinance, which defines “lot width” as “[t]he horizontal distance between the side lines of a lot measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the minimum front setback line.” Id. at art. IX(45). The board continued its analysis by looking to the definition of “front lot line,” defined in the ordinance as “[t]he lot line separating a lot from a street right-of-way.” Id. at art. IX(43)(a). The board therefore concluded that, because the unimproved lot is landlocked, “there is no lot line that exists along a street-right-of-way, thus, [the unimproved lot] has no frontage and therefore no front setback.” Based upon an interpretation of both definitions, the board stated that the ordinance “clearly has a minimum standard that a lot must possess frontage although there is no minimum dimension.”', 'This Court reviews the construction of a zoning ordinance, as we review all issues of statutory construction, in a de novo manner.

Because the language of the ordinance clearly and unambiguously delineates the dimensional requirements, we apply the plain meaning of the requirements in the context of the entire ordinance. See Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 425 (R.I. 2013).

IX(42).', 'By defining the term “lot frontage,” the ordinance clearly contemplates a frontage requirement for certain properties. 16 Although the ordinance explicitly requires that certain other classes of properties contain minimum frontage, 17 the dimensional requirements for zoning district RR-120 entirely omit any reference to frontage. Id. at art. III, § 1.', 'Because the ordinance clearly requires frontage in certain situations, the omission of a frontage requirement in district RR-120 leads us to conclude that, notwithstanding the board’s interpretation, no such frontage requirement exists. We decline to read into the ordinance a requirement that the drafters of the ordinance clearly omitted.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court with directions to remand the case to the Scituate Zoning Board of Review for a new hearing.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On the evening of November 27, 2005, plaintiff gathered with four of his friends (ages fifteen to eighteen): T.D., C.A., H.C., and L.V., at T.D.’s home, drank “[m]aybe two” beers, and set off in C.A.’s truck to explore a local haunt—the former Ladd Center in the Town of Exeter. The Ladd property has been closed since 1994; and, in the years since, it has acquired a reputation in certain quarters as a home for ghosts and things that go bump in the night. 3 There is no perimeter fence around the property, but there are a number of “No Trespassing” signs 2', 'Because we affirm the Superior Court judgment in favor of the state, we need not address defendant’s cross-appeal. 3', ""“From ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggety beasties [a]nd things that go bump in the night, Good Lord, deliver us!” Cornish prayer (Anonymous) in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 779 (Justin Kaplan ed. 16th edition, 1992)."", '-2- posted, and the building that was the focus of the group’s exploration was secured by plywood boards over the windows on the first and second floors, chains on the doors, and metal grates welded shut. The plaintiff had visited the property on two prior occasions, and there was testimony that members of the group were aware that they should not “get caught” on the premises. The plaintiff testified that he had not sought permission to enter the Ladd Center property.', 'Undaunted by the numerous obstacles to access, the group shimmied up a pipe to access a third-story window. Once inside, the group began to explore the abandoned hospital building. Although they failed to discover any ghosts, they did encounter the detritus of “medical-like tools, * * * bed frames, * * * broken stuff” left behind when the Center closed. Eventually, the group made an intriguing discovery—a cache of four clear glass bottles housed in a Styrofoam container inside a locker. 4 The bottles appeared to be gallon-sized and contained a clear liquid; the labels on the bottles were decrepit and illegible. L.V. testified that he poured a small amount of liquid from one of the bottles onto a table, to see what it was. It was apparent to the group that the liquid had a syrup-like consistency and that it was not water. The plaintiff testified that he believed the bottle contained a hazardous material. Despite not knowing what substance was contained in the vessels, the group spirited away three of the bottles.', 'The group later made its way to the first floor of the building and searched for an exit, finally kicking out part of the plywood that covered an exterior door and slipping, one by one, through the opening created between the plywood and the door frame. The plaintiff exited just ahead of H.C., who was carrying two of the gallon bottles.

He rubbed his hand on them and his hand started burning. Realizing the liquid was “some kind of chemical,” plaintiff stripped off his clothes, leaving his wallet and cell phone behind, and ran screaming for C.A.’s truck. The caustic liquid was later determined to be sulfuric acid. 6', 'The plaintiff testified that C.A. drove him to Kent County Hospital, stopping first for cigarettes and to drop off a friend. The plaintiff was treated at Kent County Hospital, where he told the staff that he had found the bottles in the woods. He was later transferred to Rhode Island Hospital, where he told the staff that he had found the bottles in sand dunes and then slipped on concrete.', 'On November 9, 2006, plaintiff filed suit in Superior Court against the State of Rhode Island, Phoenix Houses of New England, and several John Does alleging that defendants “negligently failed to inspect, repair and/or maintain its premises free from defect and/or dangerous condition.” 7 On January 18, 2012, a bench trial was conducted, at which time plaintiff testified and presented two additional witnesses: L.V. and former State Buildings and Grounds Coordinator Carl Abbruzzese. At the conclusion of plaintiff’s case, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law. The court reserved decision on the motion, and the state declined to call any witnesses. On February 16, 2012, the trial justice issued a written decision 5', 'H.C. also filed a claim against the state in a case that was consolidated with this one; that case settled and was dismissed by stipulation prior to plaintiff’s trial. 6', 'Sulfuric acid is “A highly corrosive, dense, oily liquid, * * * colorless to dark brown depending on its purity and used to manufacture a wide variety of chemicals and materials including fertilizers, paints, detergents, and explosives.

The determination of whether the attractive-nuisance doctrine applies to allow recovery for injuries incurred by a trespasser is a mixed question of law and fact. “The findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are entitled to great weight, and the resolution of mixed questions of law and fact, as well as the inferences and conclusions drawn from the testimony and evidence, are entitled to the same deference.” Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corp. v.

National Grid, 11 A.3d 110, 113 (R.I. 2011). We have defined “trespasser” as “[o]ne who intentionally and without consent or privilege enters another’s property.” Bennett v.

Burton testified that he never sought permission to enter the property, and L.V. testified that it was “general knowledge” that they should not get caught on the property. Clearly, plaintiff was trespassing at the time of his injury.', 'There is an important exception to the rule that no duty is owed to trespassers—“the so- called ‘attractive nuisance’ doctrine, which, in some instances, imposes a duty of care on landowners to trespassing children.” Hill, 11 A.3d at 113.

First National Stores, Inc., 109 R.I. 59, 64, 280 A.2d 93, 96 (1971). The plaintiff in Haddad, 109 R.I. at 60, 280 A.2d at 94, was a five-year-old child who was injured while playing in a shopping cart. The Court first noted that it had previously refused to adopt the attractive- nuisance doctrine; in deciding to join the majority of states that had embraced attractive nuisance, the Court stated that', '“A young child cannot, because of his immaturity and lack of', 'judgment, be deemed to be able to perceive all the dangers he', 'might encounter as he trespasses on the land of others. There must', 'and should be an accommodation between the landowner’s', 'unrestricted right to use of his land and society’s interest in the', 'protection of the life and limb of its young.” Haddad, 109 R.I. at', '64, 280 A.2d at 96.', 'In the years since Haddad, we have had only a handful of opportunities to consider the application of this doctrine. See Wolf v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., 697 A.2d 1082, 1086 (R.I. 1997) (holding that, as a matter of law, a railroad trestle is not an attractive nuisance because the risk of injury from an oncoming train would be apparent to anyone); Bateman v. Mello, 617 A.2d 877, 880 (R.I. 1992) (holding that, although the defendant landowner could reasonably expect neighborhood children to be on her premises, because no one had previously been injured while climbing on a gas pipe on the property, the defendant “had no reason to foresee that the gas pipe might * * * involve an unreasonable risk of serious injury” to children). It is significant that in no case have we applied the attractive-nuisance doctrine to a child older than twelve years old. 8 Indeed, comment c. to § 339 of the Restatement observes 8', 'The plaintiff in Haddad v. First National Stores, Inc., 109 R.I. 59, 60, 280 A.2d 93, 94 (1971), was five; in Bateman v. Mello, 617 A.2d 877, 880 (R.I. 1992), the age of the child was unspecified; the plaintiff in Hill v. National Grid, 11 A.3d 110, 112 (R.I. 2011), was twelve.', '-7-', '“[While] [t]he great majority of the courts have rejected any * * *', 'fixed age limit, and have held that there is no definite age beyond', 'which the rule * * * does not apply. As the age of the child', 'increases, conditions become fewer for which there can be', 'recovery under this rule, until at some indeterminate point,', 'probably beyond the age of sixteen, there are no longer any such', 'conditions.” Id. at 199.', 'The trial justice found that the state “knew that young children are likely to trespass on the Ladd Center property,” and that it is “unreasonable and even irresponsible” that gallon bottles of acid could still be found on the premises. However, the trial justice held that, because plaintiff and his friends “realized the risk of taking the bottles with them and * * * did so anyway,” the doctrine of attractive nuisance could not be applied to establish a duty.', 'We concur with the trial justice’s reasoning. There was ample testimony that the state was aware that trespassing on the Ladd Center property was a frequent occurrence.', 'Mr. Abbruzzese testified that “kids and adults” entered the buildings on the property “looking for ghosts and spirits and what the hell ever else they were looking for.” To keep out would-be ghostbusters, the state sealed the first- and second-floor windows with plywood, chained exterior doors, and welded shut some entrances. However, knowledge alone is not sufficient to establish a duty to trespassers under the doctrine of attractive nuisance.', 'In order to establish such a duty, plaintiff would need to prove that “because of [his] youth” he “[did] not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it.” Restatement (Second) Torts, § 339(c) at 197. In his submissions to this Court, plaintiff relies principally on William Prosser’s 1959 law review article to support his assertion that the attractive-nuisance doctrine should apply to a seventeen- year-old. See William L. Prosser, Trespassing Children, 47 Calif. L. Rev. 427 (1959).', '-8-', 'Prosser instructs that the doctrine first appeared in 1875 and was originally known as the “turntable doctrine” due to its early application to trespassing young children who had been “enticed upon the land by the [railroad] turntable, ‘as a bait attracts a fish or a piece of stinking meat draws a dog,’ so that the railroad was itself responsible for the trespass * * * .” Prosser, 47 Calif. L. Rev. at 430-31.', 'Prosser offers little support for plaintiff’s argument, however. Although he notes that “our present hazardous civilization” presents dangers that “a high school boy may very well not appreciate,” he concludes only that, when considering such dangers, “the verdict has been sustained as to infants of thirteen and fourteen, and there are isolated instances of fifteen and sixteen.” Id. at 441. Further, Prosser notes that', '“The one basic reason for a rule which distinguishes', 'trespassing children from trespassing adults is the inability of the', 'child to protect himself against the peril which he encounters. If', 'that reason does not exist, it has been generally agreed that the', 'whole policy of the special rule fails with it. The courts have been', 'very firm in their insistence that if the child is in fact fully aware of', 'the condition, understands and appreciates the danger which it', 'carries, and is quite able to avoid it, he stands in no better position', 'than any adult with similar knowledge and understanding.” Id. at', '461.', 'It strains credulity to think that plaintiff, a seventeen-year-old who was about to complete his G.E.D., did not realize the risk involved in climbing a pipe to an upper-story window and entering a dark, abandoned building. Further, the discovery of the bottles triggered enough caution within the group for L.V. to pour some of the liquid out for further examination. As plaintiff himself testified, when he saw the liquid in the bottle, he believed it contained a hazardous material.', 'The Restatement (Second) Torts noted in comment m. to § 339 that “the possessor is not subject to liability to a child who in fact discovers the condition and appreciates the full risk involved, but none the less chooses to encounter it out of recklessness or bravado.” Id. at 204.', '-9- The plaintiff recognized the contents of the bottle to be hazardous. We have no doubt that, as is typical in a group of young men aged fifteen to eighteen, recklessness and bravado abound. The remedy for the injury that results when bravado meets caustic acid does not lie, however, in holding the landowner liable. There is nothing in the rule that would make a property owner the guarantor of the trespassing “child’s” safety. The Restatement noted in comment b. to § 339:', '“It is now recognized by most * * * courts that the basis of', '[attractive nuisance] is merely the ordinary negligence basis of a', 'duty of reasonable care not to inflict foreseeable harm on another,', 'and that the fact that the child is a trespasser is merely one of the', 'facts to be taken into consideration. The result is a limited', 'obligation to the child, falling short of a duty to prevent all', 'foreseeable harm to him, but requiring reasonable care as to those', 'conditions against which he may be expected to be unable to', 'protect himself.” Id. at 198. Regrettably, plaintiff was old enough to appreciate the risk of breaking into an abandoned building and of transporting a substance he “had reason to believe” was hazardous; his injury was the result of a failure to protect himself, rather than an inability to protect himself. Accordingly, it was not clearly erroneous for the trial justice to hold that plaintiff failed to establish that he was too young to appreciate the risk, and thus that the doctrine of attractive nuisance is inapplicable to this case.', 'Because, in light of his status as a trespasser, the plaintiff could not establish a duty on the part of the state, and therefore no liability exists, the plaintiff’s argument that the state should share “some comparative fault” must fail. Absent a finding of negligence, there can be no comparative negligence.', '- 10 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Mruk, Jr., appeals from the entry of summary judgment in the Superior Court in favor of the defendants Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., IndyMac Mortgage Services, OneWest Bank, FSB, and Federal National Mortgage Association. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 30, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated in part, and affirmed in part. 1', 'The defendant, Dollar Mortgage Corp., was not a party to the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action against defendant Harmon Law Offices, PC.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 18, 2006, plaintiff Walter J. Mruk, Jr. (Mruk or plaintiff) executed a promissory note to Dollar Mortgage Corporation (DMC) for the sum of $236,000. The promissory note was secured by a mortgage on Mruk’s real property, located at 44 Pine Tree Road in Coventry, Rhode Island. The mortgage, also dated April 18, 2006, was held by MERS as the mortgagee and the nominee for DMC. The mortgage was expressly granted to MERS “solely as nominee for [DMC] and [DMC’s] successors ans [sic] assigns” and recognized that it would also be held by any successors to MERS. The mortgage also allowed for the sale of the note and the mortgage, as well as a change in the loan servicer 2 for the note and mortgage. The mortgage was recorded in the Land Evidence Records of the Town of Coventry at Book 1720, Page 801.', 'On April 24, 2006, DMC endorsed the promissory note to IndyMac Mortgage Services (IndyMac). In a letter dated that same day, DMC informed Mruk that IndyMac would be servicing his mortgage as of June 1, 2006.', 'IndyMac subsequently endorsed the note in blank. 3 On July 11, 2008, IndyMac was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as receiver of IndyMac. On March 19, 2009, OneWest Bank, FSB (OneWest) acquired substantially all of the assets and mortgage servicing rights of IndyMac and, 2', 'A loan servicer is an entity that sends out billing statements and collects payments on behalf of the owner of the note.

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche Bank) later became the holder of Mruk’s note as custodian for OneWest.', 'On March 3, 2010, MERS assigned Mruk’s mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA).', 'Mruk defaulted on his mortgage in 2010. Accordingly, FNMA instituted foreclosure proceedings on the Pine Tree Road property. Notice of the foreclosure sale was advertised in the Kent County Daily Times on April 6, 2010, April 13, 2010, and April 20, 2010. At the foreclosure sale, which took place on April 27, 2010, FNMA purchased the property for the sum of $237,652.63. A foreclosure deed to FNMA was executed on May 11, 2010.', 'On November 4, 2010, Mruk filed the instant action in the Kent County Superior Court, seeking declaratory relief as to the validity of the foreclosure sale and the ownership of the subject property; an order quieting title to the property; and damages for negligent misrepresentation. 4 The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on August 9, 2011. In support of their motion, defendants submitted an affidavit from Charles Boyle, the Vice President of IndyMac, a division of OneWest. The plaintiff objected to the motion. In his objection, plaintiff challenged, among other issues, the validity of the MERS assignment of the mortgage to FNMA. The plaintiff filed three affidavits, including one from a title insurer and one from an attorney who was familiar with MERS and real estate titles. Both affidavits questioned the authenticity of the signature on the mortgage assignment which was purportedly that of Andrew Harmon, the Assistant Secretary and Vice President of MERS.', 'In a written decision on defendants’ motion filed July 10, 2012, the trial justice found that the material facts in the instant case were undisputed and largely identical to the material facts 4', 'The plaintiff conceded that summary judgment may enter in favor of defendants on the claim of negligent misrepresentation. Accordingly, that claim is not an issue on appeal before this Court.', '-3- previously considered by him in the case of Payette v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, No. PC 2009-5875, 2011 WL 3794701 (R.I. Super. August 22, 2011). 5 Accordingly, the trial justice incorporated his reasoning from Payette into his decision in the instant matter. The trial justice noted that the clear and unambiguous language of the mortgage explicitly granted MERS and its successors and assigns the statutory power of sale. The trial justice addressed plaintiff’s contention that the signature on the assignment to FNMA was invalid and found that plaintiff had not submitted competent evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to its authenticity. The trial justice also noted that plaintiff did not have standing to challenge the validity of the assignment because he was a stranger to the assignment. The trial justice further accepted that the statements made in the Boyle affidavit submitted by defendants were admissible and constituted competent evidence. The trial justice found that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact existed which would result in the nullification of the foreclosure sale conducted by FNMA. Accordingly, the trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.', 'The plaintiff filed the instant appeal on August 20, 2012.

The plaintiff’s unsupported challenges to the validity of the endorsement in blank are not sufficient to create a disputed issue of material fact. Finally, this Court notes that Rhode Island’s Uniform Commercial Code does not require that endorsements be sealed or dated and, indeed, recognizes the validity of endorsements in blank made only by the signature of the endorser.', 'See generally G.L. 1956 § 6A-3-205 (defining special endorsements, blank endorsements, and anomalous endorsements of negotiable instruments).', 'The plaintiff also questions the authenticity of the signature on the mortgage assignment from MERS to FNMA. The plaintiff submitted two affidavits wherein the affiants, an attorney and a title insurer, asserted that they had reviewed many signatures purportedly made by Andrew Harmon and found noticeable differences and therefore stated that they could not be certain that the signature on the assignment was valid.', 'The trial justice concluded that the affidavits submitted by plaintiff were insufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. We agree with the trial justice. It is significant that the assignment of the mortgage was signed and stamped by a notary public, verifying that it had been signed by Andrew Harmon. Moreover, the affiants both stated that they “do not know if any of [the signatures], including the signature on the assignment in this case, were signed by Andrew Harmon.” This Court has made it clear that “conclusory assertions in an affidavit filed in opposition to a motion for summary judgment are inadequate to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact * * *.” Soave v. National Velour Corp., 863 A.2d 186, 192 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Roitman & Son, Inc. v. Crausman, 120 R.I. 958, 959, 401 A.2d 58, 59 (1979) (mem.)). We note that the affidavits questioning the authenticity of the signature were made by an attorney and a title insurer, neither of whom claimed any particular expertise in handwriting or in forgeries. Bare assertions made', '-7- by nonexpert affiants in a field that is not generally understood by the lay public do not rise to the level of competent evidence which may establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Cf. Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 393-94 (R.I. 2008) (holding that the nonmovant had established the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the authenticity of a signature where the nonmovant had submitted the affidavit of a handwriting expert, which provided information concerning the affiant’s expertise, summarized the examination technique the expert had employed, and gave the expert’s professional opinion that the signature was not valid).', 'Lastly, plaintiff challenges the admissibility of the Boyle affidavit submitted by defendants. The plaintiff asserts that Boyle’s familiarity with the business records and affairs of OneWest is a genuine issue of material fact. It is axiomatic that “affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.” Nichola v. Fiat Motor Co., 463 A.2d 511, 513 (R.I. 1983) (quoting Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure). Affidavits that “fail[] to comply with these requirements * * * [are] useless in establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Id. We find plaintiff’s challenge to the admissibility of the Boyle affidavit to be unavailing. Boyle stated that he is a vice president of IndyMac, a division of OneWest, and in that capacity, he is familiar with OneWest’s business records and has personally examined the documents attached to the affidavit. We discern no error in the trial justice’s determination that Boyle laid an adequate foundation to establish his personal knowledge and familiarity with the facts set forth in the affidavit. Moreover, we emphasize that plaintiff failed to submit any evidence to support his contention that Boyle’s familiarity with OneWest’s business records is questionable. In the', '-8- absence of any conflicting evidence, the trial justice was entitled to accept Boyle’s sworn statement as true. As this Court has previously stated, “where the facts suggest only one reasonable inference, the trial justice may properly treat the question as a matter of law.” Shappy v. Downcity Capital Partners, Ltd., 973 A.2d 40, 45 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc., 119 R.I. 70, 77, 376 A.2d 329, 333 (1977)).', 'Accordingly, we agree with the trial justice that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that the matter was ripe for summary judgment. This Court will now address whether defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.', 'B', 'Conclusions of Law', '(1)', 'The Validity of the Assignment of the Mortgage to FNMA', 'The plaintiff further alleges that the trial justice erred in holding that the assignment of the mortgage from “MERS as mortgagee and nominee for OneWest” was valid. The gravamen of plaintiff’s argument appears to be that there was no relationship between MERS and OneWest to enable MERS to transfer an interest in the mortgage given that the mortgage itself explicitly granted the right to assign to the “Lender,” i.e. DMC. The plaintiff also challenges the authority of Andrew Harmon to sign the assignment of the mortgage to FNMA since he contends that the signature was not valid and Andrew Harmon is not actually an officer of MERS.', 'Before this Court may address the merits of plaintiff’s claims, we must first address the threshold issue of standing raised by defendants. The defendants contend that plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage because he is not a party to the assignment. The trial justice briefly addressed the issue of standing and agreed with defendants that plaintiff', '-9- “does not have standing to challenge the validity of the assignment of transfer of the mortgage interest to which he is a stranger.” The trial justice based his holding on this Court’s long- standing rule that, in general, “an individual who [is] not a party to a contractual agreement lacks standing to challenge its validity.” DePetrillo v. Belo Holdings, Inc., 45 A.3d 485, 492 (R.I. 2012).', 'The sine qua non of standing is that a plaintiff must have a personal stake in the outcome. See In re Review of Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 19 A.3d 1226, 1227 (R.I. 2011) (mem.) (quoting Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utilities Commission, 452 A.2d 931, 933 (R.I. 1982) (stating that “the party seeking relief [must have] alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure concrete adverseness that sharpens the presentation of the issues upon which the court depends for an illumination of the questions presented.”)). This requirement was summarized by the United States Supreme Court in the seminal decision on standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), and was adopted by this Court in Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856 (R.I. 1997). “[T]he plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized * * * and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, “there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be ‘fairly * * * trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not * * * th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.’” Id. Lastly, “it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’” Id. at 561.', 'In addition to these requirements, standing is generally limited to those plaintiffs asserting their own rights, not the rights of others. See Rhode Island Ophthalmological Society', '- 10 - v. Cannon, 113 R.I. 16, 27, 317 A.2d 124, 130 (1974) (emphasizing that the plaintiffs “[had] standing only because of their own injury”). This Court has stated that “there is no support for the proposition that * * * an individual who is not a party to a contract may assert the rights of one of the contracting parties in order to void a contract or have it declared unenforceable.” Sousa v. Town of Coventry, 774 A.2d 812, 815 n.4 (R.I. 2001). In accordance with this principle, this Court has generally held that third parties to a contract lack standing to challenge its validity. See DePetrillo, 45 A.3d at 492; Brough v. Foley, 525 A.2d 919, 922 (R.I. 1987).', 'The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, however, while acknowledging these general principles of standing, recently held that in certain circumstances, “a mortgagor has standing to challenge the assignment of a mortgage on her home to the extent that such a challenge is necessary to contest a foreclosing entity’s status qua mortgagee.” Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 708 F.3d 282, 291 (1st Cir. 2013). In analyzing the substantive law of Massachusetts, the First Circuit focused on the fact that, by statute, mortgagors have a legally cognizable right to ensure that any attempted foreclosure on their home is lawful and also that Massachusetts permits nonjudicial foreclosures. Id. at 290. The First Circuit noted that “a Massachusetts mortgagor would be deprived of a means to assert her legal protections without having standing to sue.”', 'Id.', 'Accordingly, the First Circuit concluded that “[t]here is no principled basis for employing standing doctrine as a sword to deprive mortgagors of legal protection conferred upon them under state law.” 8 Id. at 291. 8', 'More recently, the United States District Court of the District of Rhode Island relied on the First Circuit’s reasoning in the Culhane decision and concluded that Rhode Island law also provided the same protections to mortgagors and held that mortgagors have standing to challenge “‘invalid, ineffective, or void’ assignments, such as situations where ‘the assignor had nothing to assign or had no authority to make an assignment to a particular assignee.’” Cosajay v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 2013 WL 5912569 at *4 (D.R.I. Nov. 5, 2013) (quoting Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 708 F.3d 282, 291 (1st Cir. 2013)).', '- 11 -', 'It is with the basic requirements of standing in mind that this Court will begin its own analysis of the question of whether a mortgagor, although he or she is not a party to the assignment, has standing to challenge the validity of the assignment of his or her mortgage. We find it beyond dispute that a homeowner whose home is foreclosed has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that gives the homeowner a personal stake in the outcome of litigation challenging the foreclosure. We are also satisfied that there is a causal connection between the injury and the challenged action; the assignment of the mortgage is the basis of the right to foreclose being asserted by the foreclosing entity. We further find that the injury would be redressed by a decision in the plaintiff’s favor; if we hold that the assignment of a mortgage was, in fact, invalid, then a foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to the invalid assignment would be unlawful and therefore void.', 'We recognize that our previous case law on the issue appears to be dispositive as to the issue of standing. We do not waver from these previous holdings that, in general, strangers to a contract lack standing to either assert rights under that contract or challenge its validity. See DePetrillo, 45 A.3d at 492. We conclude, however, as did the First Circuit, that “these cases paint with too broad a brush.” Culhane, 708 F.3d at 290. In particular, we emphasize that, unlike the usual third parties to contracts, the homeowners here are not attempting to assert the rights of one of the contracting parties; instead, the homeowners are asserting their own rights not to have their homes unlawfully foreclosed upon. Mortgagors in Rhode Island, no less than in Massachusetts, are in the unusual position of facing a possible eviction from their homes at the hands of an entity with which they lack privity. Absent standing to challenge the assignment by which the purported authority to foreclose has been derived, homeowners would be without legal recourse to contest this injury. We do not choose to close the courthouse doors entirely to such', '- 12 - homeowners.', 'Accordingly, we hold that homeowners in Rhode Island have standing to challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.', 'In so holding, we emphasize that this exception to the general rule precluding third-party standing to challenge a contract is narrow and confined to the circumstances of a mortgagor challenging an “invalid, ineffective, or void” assignment of the mortgage. See Culhane, 708 F.3d at 291. “[A] mortgagor does not have standing to challenge shortcomings in an assignment that render it merely voidable at the election of one party but otherwise effective to pass legal title.” Id. We further reiterate that this exception is confined to private residential mortgagors challenging the foreclosure of their homes.', 'With these limitations in mind, we turn to Mruk’s allegations challenging FNMA’s status as a lawful mortgagee. Mruk asserts that MERS never transferred legal title, that Harmon’s purported signature on the assignment is false, and that Harmon did not have the authority to execute a valid assignment even if his signature was genuine. If correct, any assignment of the mortgage and subsequent foreclosure would be invalid, ineffective, or void. Accordingly, Mruk has standing to pursue his claims.', 'Because we conclude that Mruk has cleared the hurdle of standing, we will now address the merits of his claims. Mruk’s challenge to MERS’ authority to transfer legal title appears to be premised on the fact that MERS was not also the holder of the note. This Court recently addressed the question of whether MERS, as the nominee for the owner of the note, could also be the mortgagee and exercise the statutory power of sale, and concluded that it could. See Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1084-85 (R.I. 2013). Further, this Court held that the note and the mortgage did not need to be held by one entity. This Court concluded', '- 13 - that the transactional structure whereby equitable title to the mortgage was held by the lender and by each of its successors and assigns—in this case, DMC as the lender and IndyMac, OneWest, and Deutsche Bank as its successors and assigns—while MERS held legal title to the mortgage was consistent with the law of this state. Id. at 1088. In such a situation, this Court reasoned that “the note and the equitable interest in the mortgage have always remained unified, and the mortgage has ‘followed the note.’ Furthermore, the holder of the legal title to the mortgage— MERS—always has acted as an agent of the owner of the equitable title.” Id. Accordingly, plaintiff’s argument that MERS could not have transferred legal title to its assignee because it was not also the holder of the note is unavailing.', 'Finally, plaintiff’s challenges to the validity of Harmon’s signature on the assignment and his authority to sign are equally without merit. The plaintiff has offered no competent evidence to support his assertion that Harmon is not actually a corporate officer of MERS and, as previously discussed, the affidavits disputing the validity of Harmon’s signature were insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Absent any competent evidence on the record to cast doubt upon the validity of the assignment, this Court cannot and does not disagree with the trial justice’s conclusion that the assignment of the mortgage to FNMA was valid and that, therefore, FNMA had the authority to exercise the statutory power of sale.', '(2)', 'The Validity of the Foreclosure Sale', 'Mruk contends that the foreclosure sale was invalid because, under the statutory power of sale provision in the mortgage, only the lender had the power to exercise the power of sale. The plaintiff bases his argument entirely on the provision in the mortgage which sets forth the procedures by which the lender may exercise the statutory power of sale. The plaintiff contends', '- 14 - that the trial justice erroneously ignored that paragraph in the mortgage in concluding that FNMA, which was neither the lender nor an assignee of the lender, could have exercised the statutory power of sale. We find plaintiff’s argument to be without merit.', 'We begin by noting that, in addition to the section of the mortgage cited by plaintiff, an earlier provision in the mortgage explicitly granted the statutory power of sale to MERS and to “the successors and assigns of MERS[.]” The mortgage at issue in Bucci contained substantially equivalent language regarding the lender’s authority to exercise the power of sale and granting MERS and its successors the power of sale. See Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1081. In Bucci, we held “that [the] subsequent provision [granting lender the power of sale] did ‘not negate the previous language in the [m]ortgage directly granting MERS * * * the right to’ foreclose and sell the property.” Id. We see no reason why our holding in Bucci should not apply to the case at bar.', 'We note that the facts in Bucci differ from the situation in the case before us because in Bucci, MERS did not assign the mortgage and initiated the foreclosure proceedings itself. We do not find, however, that this distinction carries weight. The mortgage explicitly granted the power of sale to MERS and its successors and assigns. Moreover, Bucci makes it clear that under our statutes, MERS may exercise the power of sale under a mortgage on behalf of the noteholder. See Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1085. It follows that, when MERS assigned its interest in the mortgage to FNMA, FNMA acquired all the rights which MERS possessed. See Rhode Island Construction Services, Inc. v. Harris Mill, LLC, 68 A.3d 450, 456 (R.I. 2013) (stating as a “basic legal principle” that an assignee possesses all the rights and remedies possessed by or available to the assignor). Accordingly, we agree with the trial justice that FNMA possessed the statutory', '- 15 - power of sale by way of assignment from MERS and had the right to exercise the power of sale upon Mruk’s default. 9', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hold that the plaintiff had standing to challenge the validity of the assignment of the mortgage. In all other respects, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The records in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. 9', 'We likewise deem plaintiff’s final assertions that the trial justice erroneously interposed facts from other cases into the instant case and failed to view the facts of this case in an independent light to be without merit. The plaintiff cites no case law in support of his contention that the trial justice could not look to the rationale of prior Superior Court cases to guide his reasoning in the case at bar. While Superior Court decisions are not binding on us, we discern no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that the facts of this case are nearly identical to the facts previously considered by him in the case of Payette v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, No. PC 2009-5875, 2011 WL 3794701 (R.I. Super. Aug. 22, 2011). Indeed, we find that the trial justice’s analysis of the issues was specific and tailored to the facts in the case at bar and we cannot fault the trial justice’s consideration of the merits of plaintiff’s arguments.', '- 16 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Walter J.

The defendant, Paul Castriotta, appeals from an order of the Superior Court that denied his motion to vacate judgment and sentence. On appeal before this Court, Castriotta argues that his plea to criminal charges should be set aside because his attorney did not inform him that the attorney was undergoing a personal struggle while he continued to represent the defendant. On October 29, 2013, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the defendant’s motion to vacate his judgment and sentence.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 15, 2008, defendant was alleged to have engaged in second-degree child molestation with three persons under the age of fourteen at Goddard Park in Warwick, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3. The defendant was accused of touching each of the minors, two of whom were sisters, on their buttocks for the purpose of his sexual gratification. On February 24, 2009, defendant was charged with three counts of second-degree child molestation and one count of driving with a suspended license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18. He was arraigned on March 6, 2009, and entered a plea of not guilty. On July 20, 2009, the date that his trial was set to begin, defendant underwent a change of heart and switched his plea to one of nolo contendere on the child-molestation charges. In consideration of defendant’s plea, the state dismissed the charge of driving with a suspended license.', 'The trial justice conducted an extensive plea colloquy with defendant, in which he acknowledged the facts alleged by the state and indicated that he understood that once the judge accepted his plea, he would not be able to change or withdraw it. At the conclusion of that colloquy, the trial justice determined that defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and he accepted defendant’s plea of nolo contendere. 1', 'Nonetheless, between the date of his plea and the date set for sentencing, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere. After conducting an extensive hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion on December 4, 2009. The trial justice then sentenced defendant to three concurrent sentences of fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), with five years to serve, and the balance suspended, with probation.', 'In addition, 1', 'The trial justice did not sentence defendant on that day; however, there was an agreement between the state, defendant, and the court that pending the receipt of a pre-sentence report, defendant would receive a sentence of no greater than five years to serve.', '-2- defendant was required to undergo alcohol and sex-offender counseling, and to register as a sex offender upon his release from the ACI. 2', 'On May 18, 2011, Castriotta filed a motion to vacate judgment and sentence.

After he had entered his plea, defendant’s first attorney informed him that he had an “internal struggle with standing up at a sentencing hearing and minimizing what it was that [defendant] had admitted that he had done * * * .” Evidently, a close relative of defendant’s attorney had been the victim of a sexual assault that was similar in nature to the charge to which defendant had pleaded. Castriotta argues on appeal that, as a result, he was not adequately represented because that attorney should have advised him prior to the plea that he had an internal struggle in continuing to represent him. The defendant argues that had he known of this conflict, he would not have entered his nolo contendere plea, and thus, his plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made.', 'We conclude that this argument, even if properly made, is utterly without merit because the record indicates that the alleged sexual assault on the relative of his counsel did not occur until after the defendant had entered his plea. Castriotta entered his plea on July 20, 2009, and defense counsel unequivocally testified at the initial hearing to withdraw the plea that the incident involving the person close to him did not occur until August 13 or 17, 2009.

Reverdes also stated that she was unable to recall how long she had been on medication or had suffered from such ailments.

The applicant then indicated that he was preparing a motion and a subpoena to obtain all of Reverdes’ medical, psychiatric, and psychological records in connection with his application for postconviction relief.', 'On May 9, 2011, applicant filed a motion3 requesting the court’s permission to issue a subpoena upon the Keeper of Records of Gateway Healthcare (Gateway) for all of Reverdes’ psychological, psychiatric, medical, and counseling records. In response, Reverdes—represented by an attorney from the Office of the Mental Health Advocate—filed an objection to applicant’s motion. At a hearing on the motion, the Superior Court justice—who also had presided over the murder trial—granted the motion. The applicant then served the subpoena for Reverdes’ medical records upon Gateway.', 'Reverdes subsequently filed a motion to quash the subpoena, and a hearing on the motion was held on July 19, 2011; attorneys were present on behalf of DePina, Gateway, the state, and 3', 'Although applicant filed the motion pursuant to Rule 17(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial justice ruled that, because the postconviction relief action was a civil matter, the subpoena should issue pursuant to the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', '-3- Reverdes—again represented by a mental health advocate attorney. At that hearing, counsel for Gateway moved the court to order the records protected pursuant to the Rhode Island Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act,4 a request that was denied by the trial justice. On behalf of Reverdes, counsel argued that DePina had failed to seek Reverdes’ health care records before the 1998 trial, and that the issue of such records falling under the ambit of newly- discovered evidence should, therefore, be deemed to have been waived. The trial justice denied Reverdes’ motion to quash the subpoena, but directed that the documents be produced for an in camera review by the trial justice in order to determine whether, before Reverdes testified about witnessing the homicide, she had been suffering any mental health issues “which may touch upon her ability to observe and to remember certain facts.”', 'After the trial justice’s in camera review of the records, a second hearing was held on July 29, 2011.', 'The trial justice—citing Rule 26 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure—declared that he had reviewed the medical records produced—totaling over 700 pages—and extracted a small percentage of documents that he deemed appropriate for disclosure to applicant. The trial justice specified that, in turning over the documents, the court was not ruling that the information contained therein was relevant or admissible in any subsequent proceeding, but rather was being provided “so that [applicant] can have a full opportunity to proceed on any legal theory and factual theory that he may believe supports his application for postconviction relief.”', 'After the ruling, counsel for Reverdes requested that the trial justice stay the decision and postpone distributing the selected documents pending an appeal to this Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 5-37.3-4 of the Rhode Island Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act. 4', 'The Rhode Island Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act is found in G.L. 1956 chapter 37.3 of title 5.', '-4- Counsel also argued that, because the records began in the year 2007, the records were not relevant to an incident that occurred in 1997. Rather, counsel claimed that the discovery request constituted a “fishing expedition,” and that to order production of health care information compiled twelve years “after the testimony is embarrassing, oppressive and burdensome under Rule 45 [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure].”', 'The trial justice entered an order (order) denying Reverdes’ motion to quash, but stayed its effect until August 12, 2011. Reverdes requested that this Court stay the disclosure of any medical records pending this appeal. This Court granted the stay5 and ordered the appeal expedited.', 'Discussion', 'As an initial matter, we first address the nature of Reverdes’ appeal to this Court. The order denying Reverdes’ motion to quash is interlocutory—a type of order that lacks finality and concerning which this Court has a long-standing practice to decline to address on appeal. See Dale v. Dale, 37 A.3d 124, 124 (R.I. 2012) (mem.) (indicating that “[i]nterlocutory orders are reviewable only by way of writ of certiorari”). Despite this general rule, however, a judicial doctrine has developed, first articulated in the case McAuslan v. McAuslan, 34 R.I. 462, 472, 83 A. 837, 841 (1912), whereby this Court “will review an order or decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, does possess such an element of finality that action is called for before the case is finally terminated in order to prevent clearly imminent and irreparable harm.”6 Town 5', 'Notably, those aspects of DePina’s application for postconviction relief not involved in this appeal were ordered to proceed in Superior Court. 6', 'A second exception to the general rule concerning interlocutory orders also exists within G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7, entitled “Appeals from interlocutory orders and judgments,” which states:', '-5- of Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 118 R.I. 644, 648-49, 375 A.2d 410, 412-13 (1977).', 'In this case, Reverdes argues that the denial of her motion to quash the subpoena seeking her medical records ends her stake in the litigation. She also argues that the consequences of the order are imminent and irreparable, because all other avenues of relief have been exhausted, and because once her medical records are released, the confidential nature of those documents will be irremediably breached. We agree.', 'The record is clear that the challenged order allows for the inspection of Reverdes’ health care records, including psychological, psychiatric, and counseling records—information that enjoys limited statutory protection. Moreover, Reverdes—who is not a party to the underlying postconviction-relief action—has no standing to challenge the introduction of those records into evidence in that proceeding. Therefore, based on the record before us, we are satisfied that the order entered possesses the requisite element of finality and potential for irreparable harm to warrant our immediate review. See McAuslan, 34 R.I. at 472, 83 A. at 841. Having resolved this procedural issue, we now turn to the merits of Reverdes’ appeal.', 'It is well settled that, although the underlying conviction from which collateral relief is sought is criminal in nature, postconviction-relief proceedings are civil actions. G.L. 1956 §§ 10-9.1-1; 10-9.1-7; Palmigiano v. Mullen, 119 R.I. 363, 374, 377 A.2d 242, 248 (1977). As a result, a litigant seeking discovery in this type of proceeding must do so in accordance with the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Sections 10-9.1-2; 10-9.1-7.', 'Rule 26(b)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[p]arties may', '“Whenever, upon a hearing in the [S]uperior [C]ourt, an injunction shall', 'be granted or continued, or a receiver appointed, or a sale of real or personal', 'property ordered, by an interlocutory order or judgment, or a new trial is ordered', 'or denied after a trial by jury, an appeal may be taken from such order or', 'judgment to the [S]upreme [C]ourt in like manner as from a final judgment, and', 'the appeal shall take precedence in the [S]upreme [C]ourt.”', '-6- obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action * * *.” This Court previously has indicated that Rule 26—along with the remaining provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to discovery—should be construed liberally so as to promote broad disclosure among parties during the pretrial phase of litigation. Henderson v. Newport County Regional Young Men’s Christian Association, 966 A.2d 1242, 1246 (R.I. 2009); Robert B. Kent et al., Rhode Island Civil and Appellate Procedure § 26:3 (West 2006). In fact, our case law is clear that “[t]he philosophy underlying modern discovery is that prior to trial, all data relevant to the pending controversy should be disclosed unless the data is privileged.” Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1246 (quoting Cabral v. Arruda, 556 A.2d 47, 48 (R.I. 1989)).', 'Despite this general policy, however, the General Assembly has crafted a statutory exception to discovery efforts that are aimed at obtaining an individual’s confidential health care information.7 Under the Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act (act), set forth in chapter 37.3 of title 5, an individual who is not otherwise a party to the proceeding must be provided with notice of the issuance of a subpoena seeking his or her health care records, § 5-37.3-6.1(a)(1), and has standing to file a motion seeking to quash a subpoena for his or her confidential health care records. Section 5-37.3-6.1(b). The act further provides that “[t]he court shall grant [the] motion to quash unless the requesting party can demonstrate that there is reasonable ground to believe the information being sought is relevant to the proceedings, and the need for the information clearly outweighs the privacy interest of the individual.” Section 5-37.3-6.1(d). Pursuant to § 5-37.3-6.1(e), the court must consider the following factors: 7', 'The stated purpose of the act “is to establish safeguards for maintaining the integrity of confidential health care information that relates to an individual.” Section 5-37.3-2.', '-7-', '“(1) The particular purpose for which the information was', 'collected;', '“(2) The individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy in the', 'information;', '“(3) The degree to which disclosure of the information would', 'embarrass, injure, or invade the privacy of the individual;', ""“(4) The effect of the disclosure on the individual's future health"", 'care;', '“(5) The importance of the information to the lawsuit or', 'proceeding; and', '“(6) Whether the information is available from another source,', 'including Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.” It is only after the court conducts this requisite analysis, and balances the requesting party’s need for disclosure with the individual’s right to privacy, that the individual’s confidential health care information may be disclosed in a judicial proceeding. Section 5-37.3-6.1(d), (e).', 'In the case before us, applicant sought access to Reverdes’ medical, psychiatric, and psychological records—information which clearly falls within the definition of “[c]onfidential health care information” under the act.', 'Section 5-37.3-3(3)(ii).', '“As such, the requested information, even though it may be subpoenaed pursuant to valid legal process, is presumptively private, confidential, and privileged.” State v.

98,State : v. : Jaylon Baker.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Jaylon Baker, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction. After a four-day trial, a jury found Baker guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license, and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence. The trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial provides the sole predicate of the appeal. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'After voluntarily waiving the jurisdiction of the Family Court, 1 defendant was charged by information with: assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count 1); obliterating or removing the mark of identification upon a firearm in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 47-24 (count 2) 2; carrying a handgun without a license in violation of § 11-47-8(a) (count 3); and 1', 'The defendant was seventeen years old on the date of the charged offenses. He voluntarily waived jurisdiction in the Family Court and was tried in Superior Court as an adult. 2', 'Prior to trial, the state dismissed count 2 pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-1- using a firearm while committing a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3.2(a)(1) (count 4). 3 The charges stemmed from defendant’s encounter with Ptlm. David Allen of the Providence Police Department’s violent-crime task force on July 17, 2010. The defendant and Ptlm. Allen were involved in a foot chase across several streets in the South Side of Providence, which culminated in Ptlm. Allen shooting defendant in his right arm and then apprehending him. After a jury trial in Superior Court, defendant was convicted on February 13, 2012 on counts 1, 3, and 4. Five witnesses testified for the prosecution, and three testified for the defense. The parties stipulated to the fact that defendant did not have a duly issued license or permit to carry a firearm. The various witnesses provided conflicting accounts of the events that occurred on July 17, 2010.', 'Patrolman David Allen', 'Patrolman Allen testified that on July 17, 2010, he was assigned to the Providence Police Department’s violent-crime task force. Patrolman Allen testified that at or around 5:30 p.m., he was on patrol in an unmarked police vehicle on Comstock Avenue in Providence. He slowed down to drive over a speed bump and observed “a couple of black males” walking out from an alleyway between two buildings located at 94 and 98 Comstock Avenue. According to Ptlm. Allen, the two men stopped abruptly when they saw him and appeared startled. Patrolman Allen testified that he stopped his vehicle, attempted to engage the two men in conversation, and asked for their names. One of the men responded “Jaylon Baker,” and at trial Ptlm. Allen identified this man as defendant. According to Ptlm. Allen, the other man said something inaudible and 3', 'The original information charged defendant with “use and discharge [of] a firearm” in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(1). The information was amended by agreement of the parties to eliminate the words “and discharge,” and to change the applicable subsection of the statute to § 11-47-3.2(a)(1). The verdict form listed this charge as “using a firearm while committing a crime of violence,” while the judgment of conviction retained the word “discharge.”', '-2- positioned himself behind defendant. Patrolman Allen asked the men where they were headed, and the man standing behind defendant backed toward the alleyway and then began running while reaching toward the waistband of his pants. Patrolman Allen testified that defendant then backed up as well and began running in the same direction, while grabbing at what “appeared to be a large, heavy object” on the right side of his waistband.', 'Patrolman Allen testified that, when defendant started moving backwards, Ptlm. Allen got out of his vehicle, at which point defendant, and then Ptlm. Allen, began to run. Patrolman Allen chased the two men into the alleyway, and he testified that he observed each of them holding a firearm. Patrolman Allen then drew his department-issued service weapon, a .40- caliber Beretta, and yelled, “Police. Drop the gun. Police. Stop.” Patrolman Allen testified that he also attempted to use his radio to dispatch his location, but was unsuccessful because someone else was already speaking on the same channel. Patrolman Allen continued to chase the two men through an open gate and into the backyard of 35 Harvard Avenue, at which point he lost sight of the second man, who was running ahead of defendant.', 'Patrolman Allen testified that defendant was holding a Ruger .22-caliber target pistol, which is distinctive looking because it has a “large thick barrel, and * * * a kind of funny- looking handle and a large front sight.” The defendant continued to run and turned to the left, and Ptlm. Allen pursued him, while yelling for defendant to stop and drop the gun. Patrolman Allen testified that when he reached the front of 35 Harvard Avenue, defendant was already across the street in front of 40 Harvard Avenue, at which point Ptlm. Allen observed defendant turn around, hold his firearm with two hands, and point it at Ptlm. Allen. Patrolman Allen then raised his own gun and fired one round at defendant, from approximately fifty feet away, while', '-3- still running toward defendant at a sprint. Patrolman Allen testified that defendant turned and continued to run into an alleyway adjacent to 40 Harvard Avenue.', 'Patrolman Allen testified that when defendant reached the border between the backyards of 40 Harvard Avenue and 43 Wesleyan Avenue, he was confronted with two fences that were roughly one or two feet apart. According to Ptlm. Allen, defendant stopped, turned around, and pointed his gun at Ptlm. Allen for a second time. Patrolman Allen was then able to broadcast over his radio that shots had been fired. Patrolman Allen fired his gun three more times, aiming at defendant, while still running toward defendant from the alleyway adjacent to 40 Harvard Avenue. Patrolman Allen testified that he saw defendant jump over the two fences that separated the backyards of 40 Harvard Avenue and 43 Wesleyan Avenue, at which point he noticed that defendant was no longer holding a gun. Patrolman Allen then re-holstered his own weapon, jumped over the same two fences, and saw that defendant had become caught on a third fence that separated 43 and 35 Wesleyan Avenue, which defendant had attempted to jump. Patrolman Allen approached defendant and patted him down. Patrolman Allen testified that “[s]ome part of the clothing -- I think it was his pant leg or shoelace or something -- was tied up, and he was hung up on the fence.” Patrolman Allen testified that he did not see defendant drop his firearm. Patrolman Allen also testified that he was running at full speed during the course of the pursuit, and that he did not stop to speak with anyone during this time.', 'After Ptlm. Allen secured defendant, he retraced his steps in search of defendant’s firearm. Patrolman Allen located a large, dark pistol in the backyard of 40 Harvard Avenue, where he had last seen defendant holding a gun. Patrolman Allen identified the weapon as the same Ruger .22-caliber pistol that he saw defendant holding during the chase. Patrolman Allen', '-4- testified that defendant was then transported to a hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to his right arm.', 'Detective Paul Romano', 'Detective Romano, who was assigned to the Providence Police Department’s Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI), processed the scene of the foot chase and shooting on July 17, 2010. Detective Romano photographed three .40-caliber shell casings in the vicinity of 40 Harvard Avenue, as well as a “Ruger Mark I .22 caliber semiautomatic” firearm located in the backyard of 40 Harvard Avenue. The firearm was loaded, with seven rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. Detective Romano testified that no latent fingerprints were recovered on this firearm, and its serial number had been obliterated. Detective Romano testified that he test-fired the firearm and found it to be functioning properly. Detective Romano also testified that a suspected .40-caliber projectile hole was discovered in the rear door of 43 Wesleyan Avenue. Detective Romano stated that no .22-caliber shell casings were found at the scene.', 'Detective Ralph Constantino', 'Detective Constantino was assigned to the Providence Police Department’s BCI, and he also responded to and processed the scene of the foot chase and shooting on July 17, 2010. Detective Constantino testified that a projectile was recovered from inside the house at 43 Wesleyan Avenue, but he could not identify what sort of firearm the projectile came from. Detective Constantino examined the hole in the back door of 43 Wesleyan Avenue with a probe and determined that the trajectory of the bullet was “slightly up from back to front, and it was pretty straight on, straight through the door.”', 'Detective Constantino explained that this trajectory indicated that the bullet “was traveling in an upward direction, as opposed to flat or', '-5- horizontal,” when it struck the door. Detective Constantino also testified that the yard behind 40 Harvard Avenue was slightly lower than the rear portion of 43 Wesleyan Avenue.', 'Javon Parrott', 'Parrott, a close friend of defendant, testified for the state. Parrott testified that he was with defendant approximately twenty or thirty minutes before defendant encountered Ptlm. Allen. Parrott stated that, shortly after he and defendant parted, he saw defendant running toward Harvard Avenue from Comstock Avenue, and he saw a police officer drawing a gun. Parrott testified that he heard the officer say, “Stop. Or I’m going to shoot,” and he saw the officer fire his gun. Parrott testified that defendant “had something in his hand,” but he stated that this object was not a gun. In contrast to this testimony, the state introduced an audio recording of an interview of Parrott conducted by the Providence police on July 17, 2010, a few hours after the foot chase and shooting. The recording captured approximately the last five minutes of an interview which, according to Parrott, lasted for roughly one hour and forty minutes.', 'A transcript of this recording was also admitted into evidence.', 'The transcript contained the following statement made by Parrott:', '“Before I split up with my cousin,[4] [defendant], I was, we was', 'walking down Broad. We were, he met up with this friend, I met', 'up with my girl. At least, 20…10 minutes later, he comes running', 'out of the um, side street in Harvard and Comstock with a gun in', 'his hand. The cops is chasing him. Another suspect ran in the', 'other direction. Cop keeps, um, running after my boy with his gun', 'pointed out saying, ‘If you don’t drop the gun, I’m gonna shoot.’', 'My cousin, [defendant], he ran in the backyard. The detective ran', 'right behind him and then they started firing shots. After that, after', 'the backyard I didn’t, I didn’t see what was done. All I saw was', 'what I heard.” 4', 'Parrott testified that he and defendant are not related.', '-6- Later in the interview, when asked where the gun was, Parrott said, “I saw him shuffling it in his hands.” According to Parrott, he initially told the interviewers that he had not seen defendant holding a gun, and then later changed his answer after the interviewers asked him the same question “[a]bout like 50 times.” Parrott testified that he was “in shock” at the time because he had been shot the year before, that he was nervous and crying, and that the officers would not let his mother into the interview room. 5 Parrott also admitted, however, that he had previously told his girlfriend that, if he had to testify in court, he would lie for defendant.', 'Detective William Brown', 'The state also called Det. Brown, a detective in the Youth Services Bureau of the Providence Police Department, who was one of the officers who interviewed Parrott on July 17, 2010. Detective Brown testified that he and Sgt. Marsland interviewed Parrott for “five or ten minutes” prior to when they began recording. Detective Brown further testified that Parrott was not crying and did not ask to call his mother at any point during the interview.', 'Vanessa Kilgore', 'The defense called Vanessa Gail Kilgore, who was living at 41 Harvard Avenue on July 17, 2010. Kilgore testified that she was exiting a vehicle in front of 41 Harvard Avenue, preparing to pick up her elderly mother, when she “noticed a police officer was on [Harvard Avenue] chasing the kids,” and the officer was holding a gun. According to Kilgore, there were many children on the street at the time, and “[t]hey went to the left and to the right.” Kilgore testified that she approached the officer, and the following interaction occurred:', '“I asked him to stop what he was doing. And um, what was he', 'doing, don’t be doing this in front of my mother, to put the gun', 'away. * * * But what he did is he took his gun and he put it down 5', 'Parrott testified that he was seventeen on July 17, 2010; however, he also testified that his birthday was November 27, 1991, which means he would have been eighteen on that date.', '-7-', 'to the side, and he told me to tell the young fellow to stop. And so,', 'what I did is I turned to the kid because the still -- the children --', 'the young fellows was on the side of me. And so I said, ‘Kids,', 'stop[,]’ because that’s what the police officer had told me to do.', 'And he had his pants rolled up in his pocket, and he just -- time', 'stood still for just one second, and then the police officer picked', 'his gun back up and child decided to run. The police officer told', 'him to stop or I’m going to shoot.” Kilgore testified that she had never met the young man whom she saw running, and she said she did not know what he looked like. Kilgore further testified that she saw the young man run across the street and between two houses and that she did not see him holding a gun. Kilgore also testified that, after checking on her mother, she went across the street and saw that “[t]he young fellow was hanging on the fence.”', 'The Defendant', 'The defendant testified that on July 17, 2010, he was walking with a friend toward a recreation center to play basketball, and they used a shortcut called a “cut-through” between Harvard Avenue and Comstock Avenue. The defendant testified that, as he exited the cut- through, he saw an unmarked police vehicle that “kind of passed us a little bit and backed up a little bit and stopped.” The defendant testified that the officer opened the door of the vehicle and began asking questions about what he and his friend were doing, where they were going, and whether they had identification. According to defendant, he stated his name and where he lived, but did not provide identification, even though he was carrying it on his person.', 'The defendant testified to a quick succession of events that followed: immediately after he declined to provide identification, the officer exited his vehicle, then defendant’s friend started running away, and then defendant began to run as well. The defendant stated that he bumped into his friend and then a house wall but continued to run across Harvard Avenue, with the officer behind him yelling, “Stop, stop, or I’ll shoot. Stop or I’ll shoot.” The defendant', '-8- testified that he jumped over a fence next to a house on Harvard Avenue and heard the officer say, “Stop or I’ll shoot,” and then he felt that he had been shot in his right arm. He testified that he kept running, tried to jump over another fence, and then his arm “gave out.” He stated that he was wearing jean shorts that became caught in the fence. The defendant testified that Ptlm. Allen approached him while he was caught on the fence and asked him, “Where’s the gun? Where’s the gun?” to which defendant responded, “Officer, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t have a gun. Can you please get me off the fence. You just shot me.” The defendant testified that he did not stop or turn to face Ptlm. Allen at any point during the chase.', 'James Farrell', 'The defense also called James Farrell, who was living at 53 Wesleyan Avenue on July 17, 2010. Farrell testified that on that day he was bicycling to his house and stopped on Comstock Avenue to speak to a neighbor. Farrell testified that, while he was stopped on Comstock Avenue, he saw an “unmarked cruiser pull up in front of two teen-age boys” who were standing on the sidewalk. According to Farrell, the officer “summoned” the boys, and then the boys both produced their wallets. Farrell testified that the boys then started running, and the officer jumped out of his car and pursued them. Farrell stated that he did not see either of the boys put their hands to their waistbands, nor did he see them touching anything resembling large, heavy objects.', 'II', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'After the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The defendant argued that Ptlm. Allen’s testimony should have been discredited because he could not have failed to see defendant throw the gun from where defendant was', '-9- caught on the third fence to where the gun was found, several feet away. The defendant further argued that Ptlm. Allen’s account of the chase was not accurate because defendant could not have jumped over a high fence, or set of fences, after being shot in the arm. Finally, defendant argued that Ptlm. Allen’s testimony was inconsistent with Det. Constantino’s testimony regarding the trajectory angle of the bullet hole in the back door of 43 Wesleyan Avenue.', 'The state countered that the court should accept Ptlm. Allen’s testimony because it was credible and supported by the physical evidence. The state further argued that the court should accept Parrott’s statement from July 17, 2010, rather than his testimony at trial, regarding the issue of whether he saw defendant holding a gun, because Parrott was defendant’s close friend and had previously told his girlfriend that he would lie for defendant. The state further argued that the court should accept the testimonies of Det. Constantino and Det. Romano regarding the physical evidence at the scene. The state asserted that the court should discredit the testimonies of Kilgore and Farrell, because both witnesses presented inconsistent and unreliable versions of the facts. Finally, the state argued that the court should discredit defendant’s version of the events because there was no physical evidence to support his claims, and because he never denied carrying a gun while Ptlm. Allen was chasing him.', 'On March 30, 2012, the trial justice denied the motion, and on May 17, 2012, he sentenced defendant to a term of twenty years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions on the felony assault charge (count 1), and ten years suspended, with probation, on counts 3 and 4, all such terms to be served consecutively. The defendant timely filed a notice of appeal, claiming as reversible error the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial.', '- 10 -', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“When deciding a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 310 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012)). “In this determination, the trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id.

Specifically, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by accepting Ptlm. Allen’s testimony over all evidence to the contrary.', 'The defendant asserts that Ptlm. Allen’s testimony was not credible and not supported by the physical evidence. In particular, defendant argues that it would have been impossible for Ptlm. Allen not to see defendant throw his gun before scaling the fence upon which he ultimately became caught, because Ptlm. Allen was looking and shooting at defendant during this time. The defendant also asserts that, if Ptlm. Allen had shot defendant when he claimed he did, it would mean that defendant vaulted over two high fences into the yard of 43 Wesleyan Avenue immediately after sustaining a gunshot wound to his arm, before becoming caught on a third, lower fence. 6 The defendant further argues that, while Ptlm. Allen testified that he fired his gun straight ahead from the alleyway adjacent to 40 Harvard Avenue into the yard of 43 Wesleyan Avenue, the bullet that penetrated the back door of 43 Wesleyan Avenue was actually further off to the right.', 'The defendant also asserts that Ptlm. Allen had a motive to lie in order to protect himself from the potential consequences of an unreasonable civilian shooting incident. The defendant suggests that the gun attributed to defendant may have been a “throwaway gun,” planted by Ptlm.

Regarding the bullet fired into the back door of 43 Wesleyan Avenue, the state notes that Ptlm. Allen testified that he fired only the first of three consecutive shots from the alleyway, because he was firing his gun as he ran toward defendant. The state also asserts that, if Ptlm. Allen had lied about defendant having a gun, he would also have lied by testifying that he saw defendant throw or drop the gun, instead of stating that he did not see this action occur. The state further argues that the jurors had adequate information to judge whether defendant would have been able to scale the two fences at 43 Wesleyan Avenue after having been shot in the arm, because the jurors went on a view of the area before the trial began, and photographs of the scene were admitted into evidence. Finally, the state argues that defendant became caught on the third, lower fence because of his clothing, not because of the injury to his arm.', 'In his bench decision denying defendant’s motion, the trial justice first addressed the inconsistency between Parrott’s testimony at trial and the statement he made to the police on July 17, 2010, ultimately determining that the jury could decide which portions of Parrott’s accounts to accept and which portions to reject. The court characterized Kilgore’s testimony as confusing and “of no particular moment,” largely because he doubted that Kilgore had had a conversation with Ptlm. Allen during the time when he was actively chasing defendant. The court found that Farrell’s testimony was similarly of no significance, because Farrell stated that defendant produced his wallet upon Ptlm. Allen’s demand for identification, an action that both Ptlm. Allen and defendant denied.', '- 13 -', 'As the trial justice explained, this case ultimately turned on whether the jury accepted the defendant’s or Ptlm. Allen’s version of the facts. The trial justice found that Ptlm. Allen’s version of events was supported by the statement that Parrott made during his interview with the police. Further, the trial justice noted that “at no time was [the defendant] ever asked by counsel, nor did he flatly ever deny carrying the gun during the chase. And at no time was he asked by counsel, nor did he ever flatly deny that he had pointed the gun at Patrolman Allen.” The defendant did testify that, when he was ultimately apprehended, he told Ptlm. Allen that he did not have a gun; however, the trial justice found that this statement was consistent with both Ptlm. Allen’s and the defendant’s versions of the events, because the defendant would have already tossed the gun aside by the time he made this statement to Ptlm. Allen. Thus, after reviewing and weighing the evidence presented, the trial justice found that the jury was “well-warranted” in crediting Ptlm. Allen’s testimony, discrediting the defendant’s testimony, and finding the defendant guilty.

99,Joanne Miller : v. : Henry Saunders et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, Joanne Miller, appeals from a Superior Court order granting summary judgment for the defendants, Henry Saunders and Kristin Saunders. 1 The plaintiff challenges the trial justice’s rulings that the plaintiff’s deceased ex-husband, Dean S. Miller, created a valid custodial trust with regard to his life insurance proceeds and that this custodial trust did not violate a property settlement agreement executed by the plaintiff and Mr. Miller in conjunction with their divorce. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. 1', 'Mrs. Saunders’s name is spelled “Kristen” in some filings, and “Kristin” in others. It is not clear which spelling is correct. Additionally, some of defendants’ filings spell Mrs. Saunders’s last name “Sunders,” but this appears to be a typographical error.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiff married Dean Miller in June 1992. During the course of their marriage, they had four children: Christopher, Margo, Alexander, and Audrey. In 2006, plaintiff filed a complaint for divorce.', 'On August 29, 2006, Mr. Miller and plaintiff executed a property settlement agreement (agreement), which was incorporated by reference but not merged into the divorce judgment. Paragraph twelve of the agreement reads as follows:', '“12. LIFE INSURANCE: The Husband has life insurance,', 'the Wife has no life insurance at this time. The Husband agrees to', 'maintain any life insurance in full force and effect for the benefit', 'of the minor children until they reach the age of majority. He will', 'annually provide proof of insurance and proof of beneficiaries to', 'the Wife.” On February 5, 2007, Mr. Miller executed a service request form with Chase Insurance Life and Annuity Company, in which he listed his four children as the beneficiaries of his life insurance policy. 2 Under a portion of the service request form labeled “Special Instructions,” Mr. Miller handwrote the following: “Beneficial interests to be paid to and managed by Kristin Saunders as custodial trustee for the benefit of my minor children.” 3', 'Mr. Miller died on January 2, 2012. In the spring of 2012, funds from his life insurance policy were distributed to Mrs. Saunders in her capacity as custodial trustee. 4 In response to this disbursement, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court on May 23, 2012, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

Additionally, plaintiff asked the court to order defendants to tender Alexander and Audrey’s insurance proceeds to plaintiff, 5 as well as to provide an accounting of all insurance proceeds payable to Mrs. Saunders as trustee for the benefit of Margo, Alexander, and Audrey. The plaintiff also sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, restraining and enjoining defendants from disposing of the life insurance proceeds payable to Margo, Alexander, and Audrey. The court entered an order granting plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order on May 23, 2012.', 'The defendants moved for summary judgment on May 30, 2012, on the ground that Mrs. Saunders was the rightful custodial trustee of Mr. Miller’s life insurance proceeds because she was clearly and unambiguously listed as custodial trustee in the service request form. The plaintiff opposed defendants’ motion for summary judgment, arguing that Mr. Miller did not create a valid custodial trust because he did not have legal authority to do so pursuant to the property settlement agreement, and because the language in the service request form failed to conform to the statutory requirements for creating a custodial trust. 6 The court held a hearing on July 12, 2012, and an order was entered on July 23, 2012, granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment and vacating the temporary restraining order. 7 The trial justice found that Mr. Miller created a valid custodial trust pursuant to the Rhode Island Uniform Custodial Trust Act (RIUCTA), G.L. 1956 § 18-13-3, and that this trust was not inconsistent with Mr. Miller’s 5', 'The record indicates that at the time plaintiff filed the complaint, only Alexander and Audrey were living with her; defendants had been appointed temporary guardians of Margo on April 11, 2012, by an order of the West Greenwich Probate Court. 6', 'The plaintiff also moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of Alexander and Audrey’s insurance proceeds, arguing that Mrs. Saunders was not the custodial trustee regarding these funds and that plaintiff was entitled to the proceeds as sole parent and legal guardian of Alexander and Audrey. 7', 'The court also denied plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment. While it appears that there was a full summary judgment hearing, the transcript ordered for this appeal contains only a record of the trial justice’s bench decision.', '-3- obligations under the property settlement agreement.

She first contends that Mr. Miller lacked the legal ability to create a custodial trust because the property settlement agreement stripped him of his “right to designate the recipient of property payable * * * upon a future event,” which is a prerequisite to the establishment of a valid custodial trust. See § 18-13-3(a). According to plaintiff, the agreement clearly required Mr. Miller to maintain his life insurance policy in full force and effect for the benefit of the minor children until they reached majority, and it afforded him “no right whatsoever to name the person or persons of his choosing to receive the policy proceeds.”', 'We review de novo the terms and provisions of a property settlement agreement that has not been merged into a divorce judgment. See Furtado v. Goncalves, 63 A.3d 533, 537 (R.I. 2013). “A property settlement agreement ‘that is not merged into a divorce judgment retains the characteristics of a contract.’” DiPaola v.

Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004) (emphasis omitted)).', 'Here, the property settlement agreement required Mr. Miller to maintain a life insurance policy “for the benefit of the minor children.” Applying a plain-meaning test to this provision, we conclude that Mr. Miller complied with the agreement by naming his four children as the beneficiaries of his life insurance policy. The agreement did not explicitly limit Mr. Miller’s ability to channel the insurance funds to his children by way of a trust, nor did it restrict his ability to designate a trustee of his own choosing. 10', 'We reject plaintiff’s assertion that the sole purpose of paragraph twelve of the property settlement agreement was to guarantee an uninterrupted stream of child-support payments in the event of Mr. Miller’s death. When a contractual term is devoid of ambiguity, we are bound to apply its usual and ordinary meaning. DiPaola, 16 A.3d at 576 (citing Singer v. Singer, 692 A.2d 691, 692 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)).', '“The subjective intent of the parties may not properly be considered by the Court; rather, we consider the intent expressed by the language of the contract.” Furtado, 63 A.3d at 537 (quoting Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 128 (R.I. 2012)). Thus, the unexpressed intent of the parties plays no role in our de novo review. Id. at 537. Here, we hold that the contractual language is not ambiguous, and that Mr. Miller did not violate paragraph twelve of the agreement by designating Mrs. Saunders “as custodial trustee for the benefit of [his] minor children” on the service request form. 10', 'Additionally, it can be implied that the agreement contemplated an arrangement such as a custodial trust, because minors are not generally able to directly receive insurance proceeds due to their inability to form binding contracts.

Lesnick, 2 The Law of Life and Health Insurance §§ 5.21[1][c][iii]; 5.22[1][b][iii] (2011).', '-7-', 'C', 'Mr. Miller’s Compliance with the Statutory Requirements', 'The plaintiff also asserts that Mr. Miller did not create a valid custodial trust because his handwritten comments in the “special instructions” portion of the service request form did not make reference to RIUCTA. Sections 18-13-3(a) and 18-13-18(b)(4) of RIUCTA provide that a custodial trust may be created by designating the recipient “[in] substance * * * ‘as custodial trustee for ___ (name of beneficiary) under the Rhode Island Uniform Custodial Trust Act.’” Thus, we must determine the meaning of the phrase “in substance” within the context of creating a custodial trust pursuant to RIUCTA.', '“This Court reviews questions of statutory construction and interpretation de novo.” Morel v. Napolitano, 64 A.3d 1176, 1179 (R.I. 2013). “When * * * statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we give the words their plain and ordinary meaning.” Id. Moreover, “when we examine an unambiguous statute, there is no room for statutory construction and we must apply the statute as written.” Id. (quoting Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., LLP, 47 A.3d 319, 328 (R.I. 2012)). In our opinion, the phrase “in substance” is clear and unambiguous as it appears in RIUCTA. Black’s Law Dictionary defines “substance” as: “The essence of something; the essential quality of something, as opposed to its mere form.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1565 (9th ed. 2009). Applying this ordinary meaning to §§ 18-13-3(a) and 18- 13-18(b)(4) of RIUCTA, we hold that the phrase “in substance” does not require a verbatim recitation of the statute’s suggested language for the creation of a valid custodial trust.', 'Mr. Miller’s special instructions identified a custodial trustee and minor beneficiaries. RIUCTA specifically instructs a custodial trustee to “administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary if: * * * The transferor has so directed in the instrument creating the', '-8- custodial trust * * *.” Section 18-13-10(a)(2). 11 This is precisely what Mr. Miller directed in his instructions, when he identified “Kristin Saunders as custodial trustee for the benefit of [his] minor children.” Because Mr. Miller identified his children as the beneficiaries of his life insurance policy and designated Mrs. Saunders as the “custodial trustee for the benefit of [his] minor children,” we conclude that it is clear that he in fact created a custodial trust pursuant to RIUCTA.', 'We hold that Mr. Miller’s instructions complied with RIUCTA’s requirements, notwithstanding his failure to expressly reference the statute.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff argued that the jury had incorrectly applied the jury instructions, specifically by failing to apply the law of comparative negligence. The trial justice found that “Mr. Coyne was a credible witness,” and said that he “[did] not disagree with the jury’s verdict in this particular matter.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied the motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.', 'The order denying the motions was entered on May 25, 2012. The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court. 9', 'Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure permits the trial court to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law after a party has been fully heard on an issue if “there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [a] party on that issue * * *.” 10', 'The trial justice also denied plaintiff’s motion because defendant had not been fully heard.', '-5-', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues, first, that the trial justice erred in granting defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the document entitled “Notice of Injury—Proof of Loss” from being submitted as evidence. 11 Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the document should have been admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, citing Rules 803(6), 803(24), 804(b)(5),12 804(b)(2), 13 and 804(c) 14 of the Rules of Evidence. The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice erred in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial because the jury verdict was inconsistent with the evidence. The plaintiff maintains that the evidence established that defendant failed to exercise a reasonable degree of care in approaching the intersection and had operated his vehicle at a speed greater than the twenty-five mile per hour speed limit. 11', 'The plaintiff also takes exception to defendant’s filing the motion in limine only on the morning of the trial, denying him an opportunity to prepare his response. 12', 'Rule 804(b)(5) is a catchall exception to the hearsay rule for statements made by unavailable declarants, permitting such statements to be admitted if they have “circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.” 13', 'Rule 804(b)(2) concerns statements made “while believing that his or her death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be his or her impending death.” 14', 'Rule 804(c) permits admission into evidence of hearsay statements made by a deceased declarant “if the court finds that it was made in good faith before the commencement of the action and upon the personal knowledge of the declarant.”', '-6-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Motion to Exclude Document Entitled “Notice of Injury—Proof of Loss”', 'It is well established that “[w]hen reviewing the grant or denial of a motion in limine, this Court will consider only whether the challenged evidence was proper and admissible and, if not, whether there was sufficient prejudice to constitute reversible error.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1242-43 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1274 (R.I. 2009)). Generally, the admissibility of evidence “is within the sound discretion of the trial justice,” and we will not disturb a trial justice’s decision “absent a showing of abuse of this discretion.” Fravala v. City of Cranston, 996 A.2d 696, 703 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Perrotti v. Gonicberg, 877 A.2d 631, 642 (R.I. 2005)). Whether evidence falls within an exception to the hearsay rule is a question that is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice. Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 996 A.2d 684, 692 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, this Court will not disturb a ruling in that respect unless it is clearly erroneous. Medeiros v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 712 A.2d 869, 871 (R.I. 1998).', 'We begin by noting that plaintiff’s appeal of the trial justice’s decision on the motion in limine may not have been properly preserved for review by this Court. The trial justice stated that he was “rul[ing] preliminarily that the objection of the defendant is sustained on the grounds that the statement sought to be presented by the plaintiff * * * is hearsay [] [t]hat does not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule.” We have often reiterated the well-established rule that “[a] ruling on a motion in limine, unless unequivocally definitive, will not alone suffice to preserve an evidentiary issue for appellate review; a proper objection on the record at the trial', '-7- itself is necessary.” State v. Andujar, 899 A.2d 1209, 1222 (R.I. 2006). Here, the record from the trial does not reflect that plaintiff objected to the trial justice’s decision. We note, however, that the trial justice had previously expressed his reservations concerning the admissibility of the “Notice of Injury—Proof of Loss” document on the grounds that defendant would not be able to “cross-examine the declarant, meaning [Mrs.] Martin, as to what it is she wrote about the circumstances of this accident.” Moreover, the motion in limine and the trial justice’s decision were made on the very day the trial was scheduled to commence. Under the circumstances, plaintiff may well have been reluctant to “attempt to admit [the document] at trial in contravention of the trial justice’s clear order.” Id. Therefore, this Court will address the merits of plaintiff’s contention that the trial justice committed reversible error in granting defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the “Notice of Injury—Proof of Loss” document as inadmissible hearsay.', 'Specifically, plaintiff argues that the document should have been admitted under the exceptions to the hearsay rule contained in Rules 803(6), 803(24), 804(b)(5), 804(b)(2), and 804(c). Before delving into the merits of plaintiff’s argument, however, this Court must address the issue of waiver raised by defendant. “[A]ccording to our well-settled ‘raise or waive’ rule, issues that were not preserved by a specific objection at trial, sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection, may not be considered on appeal * * * despite their articulation at the appellate level.” Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 68 A.3d 425, 439 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1018 (R.I. 2005)). At trial, plaintiff expressly limited his argument to Rules 803(6) and 803(24). Accordingly, plaintiff’s arguments concerning Rules 804(b)(2), 804(b)(5), and 804(c) are waived and will not be addressed on appeal.', '-8-', 'The main thrust of plaintiff’s argument is that the document is admissible under the business-records exception of Rule 803(6). This Court has set forth a four-part test for the admissibility of a hearsay business record:', '“First, the record must be regularly maintained in the course of a regularly', 'conducted business activity. Second, the source of the information must be a', 'person with knowledge.', 'Third, the information must be recorded', 'contemporaneously with the event or occurrence, and fourth, the party introducing', 'the record must provide adequate foundation testimony.” Rhode Island Managed', 'Eye Care, Inc., 996 A.2d at 691 (quoting Fondedile, S.A. v. C.E. Maguire, Inc.,', '610 A.2d 87, 93-94 (R.I. 1992)). Moreover, “[i]n order ‘[t]o provide [an] adequate foundation a party must prove the first three requirements and authenticate the document or record.’” Id. (quoting Fondedile, S.A., 610 A.2d at 94). Here, there is no dispute that plaintiff did not bring in a representative from Allstate to either authenticate the document or establish the other necessary elements of Rule 803(6). The plaintiff argues that he was not given the opportunity to do so because the motion in limine was not filed until the morning of trial. We find this argument to be unpersuasive. The defendant stated at oral argument—and plaintiff did not dispute—that the document was produced during the course of an earlier arbitration, thus giving plaintiff more than enough time to obtain a representative from Allstate before the start of trial. We see no reason for plaintiff’s failure to foresee the need to bring in a representative from Allstate in light of the document’s admitted importance to plaintiff’s case at trial and the well-established requirements of Rule 803(6). The testimony of an Allstate representative was needed not only to establish authenticity but also the other elements of Rule 803(6). Without testimony from Allstate to establish that the document was, in fact, regularly kept in the course of Allstate’s business and recorded contemporaneously with the collision, we agree with the trial justice that there was not sufficient evidence that the document was reliable so as to qualify as a business record. Absent this necessary testimony, we', '-9- cannot find that the document clearly falls within the purview of Rule 803(6). Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in granting defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the document.', 'Finally, this Court will briefly turn to plaintiff’s argument that the document may also be admissible under the so-called “catchall” exception to the hearsay rule contained in Rule 803(24). We find this argument to be unpersuasive. We have made it clear that the catchall exception “is ‘meant to be reserved for exceptional cases’ and is ‘not intended to confer a broad license on trial judges to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions * * *.’” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1165 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Conoco Inc. v. Department of Energy, 99 F.3d 387, 392 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). Moreover, “this exception is ‘not to be used as a device * * * to prove material facts through * * * unsworn statements as a substitute for * * * testimony * * *.’” State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532, 535 (R.I. 1994) (quoting State v. Germano, 559 A.2d 1031, 1037 (R.I. 1989)). We do not find that the instant matter constitutes the sort of exceptional circumstance that would justify application of the catchall exception.', 'Accordingly, we agree with the trial justice’s decision that the “Notice of Injury—Proof of Loss” document was inadmissible hearsay and will not disturb his decision on appeal.', 'B', 'Motion for Judgment as Matter of Law and/or For a New Trial', '“This Court reviews ‘a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.’” Bossian v. Anderson, 69 A.3d 869, 876 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Lett v.

Finally, plaintiff asserts that the jury failed to properly apply the law of comparative negligence.', 'We find plaintiff’s arguments to be without merit. In deciding the motion for a new trial, the trial justice summarized the evidence at trial and determined that defendant “was a credible witness” and that he “did not exaggerate, [or] overly embellish his testimony.” The trial justice determined that it was a “reasonable inference” that Mrs. Martin had “entered the intersection in disobedience of the red light, [and] that it was her negligence in not heeding the red signal light, * * * which was the proximate cause of the accident.” The trial justice also summarized the jury instructions as to the issue of proximate cause.

The defendant, Robert Raso, appeals from eight Superior Court judgments of conviction declaring him to be in violation of the terms of his probation and sentencing him to serve twenty-five years of previously imposed suspended sentences.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the complaining witness’s testimony was inconsistent and not credible, and that, therefore, the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding a violation. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In 1990, defendant pled nolo contendere to twenty-six offenses, including: felony assault, second-degree sexual assault, kidnapping, assault with intent to commit murder, arson, and a number of robberies. On the one arson and eight robbery charges, he was sentenced to forty', '-1- years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), consisting of twelve years to serve and twenty-eight years suspended, with probation.', 'On March 8, 2011, the state filed a probation-violation report pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure 1 alleging that defendant had failed to comply with a specific term of his probation by failing to keep the peace and be of good behavior. 2 In its violation report, the state noted that “[s]aid violation of probation is not contingent upon any specific criminal offense.” It was, however, based upon allegations of sexual assault; 3 the complaining witness was defendant’s fourteen-year-old stepdaughter, Natalie. 4', 'A combined probation violation and bail hearing was conducted over the course of five days in the Superior Court, commencing on March 22, 2011. Thirteen witnesses testified during the hearing regarding Natalie’s allegations of sexual abuse, the most recent of which had occurred on March 6, 2011. As the sole issue raised by defendant on appeal concerns the credibility assessments of the hearing justice, we set forth the testimony of the various witnesses in some detail. 1', 'Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows:', '“The court shall not revoke probation or revoke a suspension of', 'sentence or impose a sentence previously deferred except after a', 'hearing at which the defendant shall be afforded the opportunity to', 'be present and apprised of the grounds on which such action is', 'proposed.

Prior to the hearing the State shall furnish the defendant', 'and the court with a written statement specifying the grounds upon', 'which action is sought under this subdivision.” 2', 'The probation-violation report was filed with respect to only the arson and eight robbery convictions. 3', 'A criminal complaint was filed charging defendant with one count of first-degree sexual assault.

She further testified that she woke around midnight or 12:30 on March 6 to find that defendant had entered her room and climbed into bed with her. Natalie stated that defendant removed her pajama bottoms and touched her chest and her vagina with his hands and his mouth. She recalled that defendant had first touched her chest and “made out” with her when she was “nine or ten” and that the sexual conduct, including contact 5 with his penis, occurred on “more than ten” occasions prior to March 6. 6 5', 'Natalie testified that she had oral contact with defendant’s penis; and stated that, while she did not deny telling the Child Protective Investigator that defendant had penetrated her with his penis, she did not remember what she told the investigator. 6', 'During Natalie’s testimony, the hearing justice granted a short recess and, before resuming testimony, stated the following:', '“I think it’s important that the record reflect, as it certainly can’t', 'when it doesn’t reflect with words, the difficulty with which this', 'witness had prior to the recess in giving her testimony.

Natalie testified that she did not tell her mother then because “she wouldn’t believe me and I didn’t want all this to happen.” After breakfast, the family stopped to buy paint before returning to their home. Shortly after they returned, a DCYF caseworker, Ann Murphy, arrived at the apartment and questioned Natalie. This interview resulted in defendant being removed from the home.', 'Natalie testified that on the evening of March 10, she was brought to the basement of her mother’s friend’s home and questioned there for about three and a half hours by her uncle, Ian Sateikis, her mother’s friend Heather Burlingame, and, finally, her mother. 8 Throughout a more than three-hour barrage of questions and accusations that she was lying, during which her mother told her that she was “a f * * * ing liar” and that defendant would “die in jail,” Natalie maintained that her stepfather had molested her. Natalie recalled that Burlingame told her that', 'extremely tearful and shaking and was presenting this testimony in', 'the largest courtroom in the building in front of an unusually large', 'audience. Certainly their right to be here, I’m not suggesting', 'otherwise, but I do feel that based on what I observed prior to the', 'recess and part of the reason I took the recess as requested is that', 'this witness, albeit 14 years old, does not present as someone who,', 'of that age, who may be able to handle everything that comes their', 'way and appeared to me to be suffering unreasonable and', 'unnecessary emotional harm in giving this testimony and I just', 'want the record to be clear.” 7', 'No text messages were entered into evidence, and there was testimony that the text messages had been deleted. 8', 'Burlingame, at whose residence these events took place, did not testify.', '-4- Natalie herself could be prosecuted. Eventually, however, Natalie told her mother “it wasn’t true.” She testified that she did so because her mother did not believe her, and that once she recanted, the questioning stopped. The following day, March 11, Natalie gave a statement to the Burrillville police in which she again stated that “it wasn’t true.” Natalie testified that she did so “[b]ecause [she] wanted it to be over.”', 'The Young Friends', 'Natalie’s friend Riley testified that in September 2010, Natalie divulged that “her stepfather had been raping her since she was in [s]ixth [g]rade.” Riley testified that Natalie did not tell her any details and that “[she] didn’t want to know.” Riley testified that she never told anyone about this because Natalie asked her to promise not to tell anyone.', 'The next witness was Sarah, who testified that she was in the seventh grade when Natalie first told her that defendant was molesting her and that he had been doing so since she was nine years old. Sarah recalled that Natalie made her promise to keep it a secret, so that her younger sister would not “get taken away” or “go through life without her father.” Sarah stated that she kept this promise and did not tell anyone. Sarah testified that on March 6, Natalie texted her that defendant “drugged her, put duct tape over her mouth and raped her.” According to Sarah, the text was deleted when the battery fell out of her phone. Natalie denied ever texting Sarah that defendant drugged her and duct-taped her mouth.', 'The Uncle', 'Ian Sateikis, Natalie’s uncle, was the next witness to testify. Sateikis lives in Illinois, and his sister, Penelope Edwards, is married to defendant. Sateikis testified that, after his sister called and told him that Natalie “had made allegations towards [defendant],” he drove to Rhode', '-5- Island. Sateikis recalled that his sister asked him to talk to Natalie “to find out what was going on and if she was telling the truth.”', 'On the evening of March 10, according to Sateikis, he took Natalie, along with Burlingame, to the laundry room in Burlingame’s house. He testified that Edwards gave him a digital recorder, and, rather than place it on the table in front of Natalie, he put it in his sweatshirt pocket and, half an hour into the questioning, he pressed the record button while the recorder was still in his pocket.9', 'After the initial two hours of questioning Natalie, Sateikis testified, he returned upstairs to speak to Edwards, telling her, “I don’t think we’re going to get anything.” Upon returning to the basement, Edwards began to question Natalie for “45 minutes, half an hour,” according to Sateikis, while he and Burlingame remained in the room with them. Sateikis characterized the tone of “that 45 minutes” as “[s]ort of like an interrogation style,” and he testified that Natalie’s demeanor was silent at first, but that she started “getting more frustrated,” “more upset” and that she was crying and her voice was “shaky.” He testified that, at some point, Edwards’s friends Jessica Lohrke and Jennifer Desper came into the room, but that some of that session was not recorded. Sateikis testified that he left the room for a period of time and that, when he returned, Edwards wanted to speak to Natalie alone, so he left, along with Burlingame, Lohrke, and Desper. He testified that twenty to thirty minutes later, Edwards came out with her arm around Natalie saying, “[Natalie] told the truth, that she lied.”', 'Sateikis further testified that on March 15 he went to the Burrillville Police Department to make a statement and that, after meeting with Sergeant Riendeau, he “kind of looked back at the conversation [he] had with [Natalie] that Thursday and [he didn’t] think [he] did the right 9', 'The CD of this recording was admitted into evidence as joint exhibit No. 1.', '-6- thing.” He recalled being “angry at [him]self,” and he testified that he did not think he “really knew fully what was going on at first and [he] shouldn’t have talked to her like that.” After leaving the police station, Sateikis testified, he spoke to Natalie and apologized, saying, “I shouldn’t have done that and I should have listened to her and I asked her if what she had said happened to her happened.” Sateikis testified that Natalie said “yes,” and told him that she recanted because “she thought it would be over faster and her mom wouldn’t believe her anyway.” Sateikis then called Sgt. Riendeau and returned to the police station to make another statement.', 'The Probation Officer', 'The defendant’s probation officer, Kerri Giorgio, testified that defendant had been on unsupervised probation, but that on January 19, 2011, due to information brought to her attention, his status was changed to supervised probation. In accordance with that change in status, defendant met with Giorgio in her office on February 28, 2011. During this meeting, defendant showed Giorgio some pictures of his family; and when she commented about a resemblance between Natalie and her mother, defendant responded, “oh, yeah, she really started developing there.” Giorgio testified that the comment was “a little upsetting” to her and that she made a note of it and brought it up to her supervisor.', 'The Child Protective Investigator', 'Ann Murphy, Child Protective Investigator (CPI) for DCYF, testified that on March 6, 2011, she received a call through the child-abuse hotline concerning Natalie’s household. In familiarizing herself with DCYF records, Murphy noted that there had been two other calls to the hotline regarding the residence: one in January and one on March 1, 2011. According to Murphy, no investigator was dispatched in response to either of the earlier calls. Murphy', '-7- testified that she contacted Burrillville police and arranged to have an officer meet her at defendant’s home.', 'Murphy testified that she arrived at the home in the early afternoon and, after identifying herself as a CPI, asked to speak with the children. She first spoke with Natalie’s four-year-old sister, Katy 10 and, after she satisfied herself with regard to Katy, Murphy interviewed Natalie. After conversing briefly, Murphy stated that she told Natalie that she was there because there were concerns that Natalie was being abused by defendant. According to Murphy, Natalie began crying “very hard,” and, in answer to direct questions, affirmed that her stepfather, defendant, had touched her without her consent and that the last time this had occurred was the previous night. Murphy testified that, in response to further direct questions, Natalie stated that defendant put his penis in her mouth, penetrated her vagina, and put his mouth to her vagina. Murphy further testified that Natalie stated that the sexual contact had been going on for four years, since she was nine years old, and that it happened “about once a week over four years.” Murphy explained that, as a CPI, her purpose was to find out if abuse had taken place and, if so, to protect the child; she did not attempt to gather full details during an initial interview, leaving that task to Day One. 11', 'Murphy testified that the interview with Day One was scheduled to take place on March 11, 2011. Murphy testified that she “made it clear to [Edwards] at that time we expected her to protect her child, not speak with her about the case” because “the child was clearly very upset 10', 'Again, a pseudonym. 11', 'According to Murphy,', '“Day One is a center in Rhode Island that is used for rape victims, for any', 'children who had been sexually abused * * * they do interviews with the', 'police, with the Attorney General’s office and with DCYF to ask children', 'questions so they only have to ask the detail one time with everyone', 'present as opposed to being asked over and over and over again.”', '-8- and needed to be spoken to in a place where the counselor is there, the professionals[] that could process what had taken place.”', 'Murphy testified that she informed the Burrillville police officer that Natalie had disclosed sexual abuse, and the officer removed defendant from the home.', 'According to Murphy, she then sat down to speak with Edwards and told her what Natalie had said happened. Murphy testified that Edwards’s immediate response was that “she wanted to be sure it was true, for [Natalie] and [defendant] did not get along.” According to Murphy, Natalie was then taken to the hospital for an examination, and a rape kit was performed.', 'According to Murphy, the following day, after police had removed the sheets from Natalie’s room, Edwards called Murphy to tell her that, if there was hair found in the sheets, it could be from defendant, because he slept there Friday night. Murphy testified that Edwards also mentioned that she had taken away Natalie’s cellphone. Murphy testified that she told Edwards that, while it was appropriate to monitor telephone, texting, and Facebook, she should give Natalie the phone back because taking it away could be viewed as punishment of the child for disclosing abuse. The next day, March 8, according to Murphy, Edwards stated that, if sperm were found in the sheets, it could be because defendant had “done something with himself on the bed.”', 'Murphy testified that Natalie lived in the house until March 16, when she (Murphy) met with Natalie again about concerns that her mother was not protecting her.', '“She stated that she did not want to live with her mother, that over', 'the past since I had met with her that her mom has asked her', 'several times what had happened, that her mom told her she was', 'lying, that her sister [Katy] wouldn’t have a father because of what', 'she has said. She stated that her phone had been taken away and', '-9-', 'given to the police. Her computer had been taken away and given', 'to the police.” 12 Murphy testified that she then met with Edwards and told her she was removing Natalie from the home. According to Murphy, Edwards responded that she did not believe Natalie’s disclosure that she had been abused. Natalie was placed with her grandparents.', 'The Forensic Biology Lab Supervisor', 'The next witness to testify was Cara Lupino, supervisor of the forensic biology lab at the Department of Health. Lupino stated that her lab examines evidence in cases of violent crimes and sexual assaults and that, in this case, she examined the rape kit and the samples taken from the bedding in Natalie’s room. Lupino testified that the oral and vaginal swabs in the rape kit tested negative for the presence of seminal fluid. She further testified that state’s exhibit No. 4, a black and white comforter from Natalie’s room, tested positive for seminal fluid and had sperm cells present in the stain. Lupino testified that the DNA profile of the comforter stain matched the DNA profile of defendant’s reference sample. 13 Finally, Lupino testified that a test of state’s exhibit No. 5, the bedsheet from Natalie’s bed, revealed seminal fluid but no sperm cells; she noted that this is “commonly encountered with males who have a low sperm count or have a vasectomy.” DNA testing, according to Lupino, demonstrated a match to defendant and Natalie, as well as potentially to a third person. In her testimony, Lupino noted that DNA is contained in skin cells and “potentially anybody who had contact with an item could leave skin cells behind.” 12', 'Edwards admitted that she did take away Natalie’s phone and computer, although there is no indication that they were turned over to the police. According to Edwards, she took away the phone after finding “inappropriate sexting from [Natalie’s] girlfriend.” 13', 'Regarding the possibility that the DNA profile could match with anyone other than defendant, Lupino stated: “According to the database that we use which is built by the FBI, in the U.S. Caucasian population it is seen in 1 in every 9.37 times 10 to the 16 people which is approximately 93 quintillion people.”', '- 10 -', 'The Landlord', 'Matthew Stamp, landlord for both Barbato and defendant, was the next witness to testify. Stamp testified that defendant had been his tenant since 2008 and that Barbato had been his tenant for four months. He testified to several complaints he received from each of them about the other, culminating with a plumbing problem in which “a bunch of mail cut up in pieces” was found to be clogging the pipes after there had been allegations of mail theft in the building. Stamp noted that he had received no complaints about defendant prior to Barbato’s tenancy.', 'The Mother’s Friends', 'The next witness to testify was Jessica Lohrke, a friend of Edwards’s who was present at Burlingame’s house on the evening of March 10 when Natalie was being questioned. Lohrke testified that she was present for approximately twenty to thirty minutes during the latter part of the questioning of Natalie, that she did not ask any direct questions herself, and that Natalie “was crying at certain times and she just kind of kept raising her shoulders and didn’t answer questions.” Lohrke testified that she felt “[s]ome of the facts didn’t add up of what [Natalie] was saying; her timeline when things were happening, the way she was acting, the way she was. She just wouldn’t talk.” However, Lohrke admitted that she did not hear the earlier questioning and that her view of whether Natalie was acting “appropriately” would have changed had she known that, earlier, Natalie’s uncle had told Natalie that her stepfather would be killed in jail and that a lawyer would “shred her apart.”', 'The next witness to testify was Edwards’s childhood friend, Jennifer Desper. Desper testified that she was also present on March 10 at the Burlingame house and that she went into the room with Natalie after the girl had been questioned by her mother and her uncle. According to Desper, after she shared her own history of having been the victim of a sexual', '- 11 - assault, she and Lohrke asked Natalie, “[D]id this happen to you?” and she responded “no.” Desper testified that, when asked why she had made the allegation, Natalie replied, “I just wanted him gone.” Desper testified that, at the time, she was not aware of the tone of the questioning that had taken place immediately prior to her discussion with Natalie.', 'The Mother', 'Natalie’s mother, Penelope Edwards, testified that she has been married to defendant for five years, since Natalie was nine years old. Edwards testified that Natalie’s sister, Katy, has her own bedroom but does not sleep in it. Instead, she sleeps with one of her parents in the master bedroom, and the other parent sleeps in Katy’s room. Edwards further testified that, on nights when Natalie is not at home, she and defendant sleep in Natalie’s bed, because it is bigger.', 'On Friday evening, March 4, according to Edwards, Natalie slept at a friend’s house and defendant slept in Natalie’s bed. Edwards testified that she left her bed and joined defendant in Natalie’s bed where they began to “fool around” before being interrupted by Katy. Edwards testified that she left Natalie’s bedroom, telling defendant, “I’m going back to bed with [Katy], take care of it yourself if you need to, sorry.”', 'Edwards testified that the next evening, the night of the alleged assault, she retired with Katy at around 10:30 p.m. and did not hear anything unusual during the night. Edwards testified that she first suspected her daughter was lying when they returned from the hospital after defendant had been removed from the house and Natalie seemed “floaty and happy.” Edwards testified that her own mother observed this and asked, “Penny, do you think she’s lying?” Edwards stated that she did not feel that Natalie’s story made sense. She testified that Natalie told her, “I’ve been trying [to] get rid of [defendant] for years,” and claimed that Natalie blamed', '- 12 - defendant for her breakup with her boyfriend.', 'Edwards further testified that she believed Natalie’s friends were encouraging her to lie.', 'Edwards testified that the meeting at Burlingame’s house was intended “[t]o get the truth of what was going on” and that she and her brother taped the questioning “[j]ust to have it, just to hear it, to have it to show what [Natalie] was saying.” Edwards testified that she did not tell Natalie the reason for their visit to Burlingame’s house. According to Edwards, she was angry and aggravated when she questioned Natalie. Edwards admitted that she did not believe her daughter and that she demanded details when she questioned her in the basement. Edwards testified that she yelled at Natalie, saying, “[Y]ou’re such a f * * * ing liar” and that, at one point, Natalie responded “[O]kay, I’m lying, is that what you want to hear?”', 'Finally, Edwards testified, Natalie said, “I lied. I didn’t think it would affect this many people.”', 'The Defendant', 'The final witness at the hearing was defendant. The defendant testified that he and Barbato “argued a few times over several things that had happened,” and that he called the police on several occasions regarding these disputes. The defendant testified that, as a result of the problems he was having with the neighbors, in late February 2011, he decided to move. The defendant testified that he and Natalie had arguments or disagreements over the plan to move and the earlier breakup with her boyfriend.', 'According to defendant, he and Edwards had intimate relations in Natalie’s bed two to four times a month. He went on to testify that Natalie had the largest bed and the largest bedroom in the house. The defendant testified that he and Edwards began to be intimate on Friday evening, March 4, but were interrupted and he later “pleasured himself.” He noted that he had had a vasectomy. The following evening, according to defendant, he brought Natalie a', '- 13 - milkshake as she had requested, but he stated that he left the room, spent time on the computer and then went to bed in Katy’s room, where he remained until morning. The next morning, after going to breakfast with Natalie and her mother and sister, defendant testified that the family shopped for supplies to paint Natalie’s room because “[he] had been promising her we were going to paint the bedroom the last six months.”', 'The defendant stated that he had “never, never ever” done anything sexually inappropriate with Natalie. He testified that he had had several phone conversations with Edwards, and that she had visited him at the ACI on March 12, 201l, at which time “She told me * * * that [Natalie] had taken her story back and they had a tape recording on it.” The state offered defendant’s criminal record as exhibit No. 7, and it was entered in full without objection. When asked if he “was convicted of” a 1987 second-degree sexual assault, defendant said, “I pled guilty to a large assortment of charges as a plea agreement.” When asked, “I want to know simply did you lie to the Judge when you pled guilty?” defendant testified, “Yes, I lied to the Judge.”', 'At the conclusion of the violation hearing, the hearing justice set forth in rather extensive detail the credibility assessments and factual findings supporting her conclusion that defendant had failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior, in violation of the terms of his probation. The hearing justice sentenced defendant to serve twenty-five years in each of the nine concurrent sentences referenced in the probation-violation report.', 'On April 13, 2011, defendant filed notices of appeal; final judgments were entered on April 18, 2011. 14 14', 'The defendant filed this appeal prior to the entry of final judgment, however “this Court has stated that it will treat a premature appeal as if it had been timely filed.” Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Bleau v.

Because probation-violation hearings are not part of a criminal prosecution, “the ‘burden of proof at a probation-violation hearing is much lower than the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt’ used in criminal trials.” Id. (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 406-07). In fact, “the state need only show that reasonably satisfactory evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.” Id. at 468-69 (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407). To make this determination, “the hearing justice ‘weighs the evidence and assesses the credibility of the witnesses.’” Id. at 469 (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407). This Court accords “great deference” to the hearing justice’s credibility assessments. Id. (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407).

Jackson, 966 A.2d 1225, 1229 (R.I. 2009)). Instead, our review is “limited to considering whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.” Id. (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the hearing justice’s credibility findings were arbitrary and capricious because they were unsupported by facts. The defendant asserts that Natalie’s testimony was not credible due to her inability to remember very recent events and due to the', '- 15 - allegations of penetration and oral sex that she made to Murphy, the CPI, as well as during her basement interrogation, that were not reflected in her testimony before the court. Further, defendant argues that the tone of the interrogation troubled the hearing justice such that she relied on it in rendering her decision; defendant asserts that, however ill-advised that interrogation was, he “had nothing to do with this inquisition.” The defendant argues that the consistency of Natalie’s testimony with that of her friends Riley and Sarah is attributable to the fact that they “were in cahoots.” Further, defendant points to Sarah’s testimony that Natalie told her defendant drugged her and put duct tape over her mouth—a statement that Natalie denied making—as demonstrating that either Natalie lied or the girls could not “keep their stories straight.” Finally, defendant argues that the consistencies that the hearing justice found between Natalie’s testimony and the evidence could also be consistent with defendant’s assertion that the alleged abuse never took place. 15', 'We note that a probation-revocation hearing does not require “the full panoply of rights due a defendant in * * * a criminal proceeding.” Ford, 56 A.3d at 468 (quoting State v. Kennedy, 702 A.2d 28, 31 (R.I. 1997)). Here, defendant had the benefit of a five-day hearing, during which no fewer than thirteen witnesses gave testimony. Five of these witnesses testified for defendant. The hearing justice noted that defendant’s hearing “lasted longer than many criminal trials.” Nevertheless, the standard employed in probation-violation hearings is considerably lower than that which applies in criminal prosecutions; “the state need only show that reasonably 15', 'The defendant also appears to argue that the swift timetable of sixteen days from arrest to probation-violation hearing somehow prejudiced him. However, because the hearing justice took pains to ascertain that defendant was ready to proceed at the start of the hearing, and because defendant responded in the affirmative each time he was asked if he had had adequate time to discuss the case with his attorney, we need not address this argument.', '- 16 - satisfactory evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.” Id. at 468-69 (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407).', 'The hearing justice, in a thorough decision, stated that she was “not only reasonably satisfied that [defendant] sexually assaulted [Natalie] on March 6, 2011, and over the course of the four years before that, I am near certain of it * * * .” In her decision, the hearing justice specifically found Natalie’s testimony to be credible and consistent with the testimony of both Riley and Sarah, whom she also found to be credible.', 'The hearing justice addressed the inconsistency in Sarah’s testimony that Natalie told her that defendant drugged and duct-taped her. The hearing justice allowed for the possibility that some of the details were wrong, but she also stated,', '“Maybe they weren’t wrong which made [Natalie] deny saying at the', 'hearing but that does not undermine [Natalie’s] hearing testimony. The', 'fact that not all of the friends’ recollections were in the police statements', 'that they gave is also understandable as the focus there was not on the past', 'conversations or events but on the disclosures that occurred in March of', '2011.”', 'Likewise, the hearing justice found Natalie’s testimony to be consistent with what she said during her “grueling interrogation” on March 10. The CD recording of the several-hours- long interrogation was entered into evidence as a joint exhibit. The defendant argues that the hearing justice “was obviously very troubled” by the basement interrogation, such that she concluded that Natalie’s recantation was coerced. We are similarly troubled. In her decision, the hearing justice found that the recantation “was coerced and involuntary. Her recantation came only after she was convinced that she would not be released from the basement interrogation room until she said it didn’t happen, even if it did, and no one can really claim[] otherwise who has not listened to the [CD].” We concur. It is difficult to conjure a more coercive environment than this—a fourteen-year-old child subjected to several hours of pleading, mocking, screaming,', '- 17 - and threats from her mother, her uncle, and three other adults who, all the while, claimed to love and support her. Nevertheless, Natalie withstood this interrogation for hours before finally recanting.', 'Further, days later when her uncle realized the gravity of the injustice he had perpetrated against his niece, Natalie took the opportunity to disavow her recantation. We recognize, as defendant argues, that he “had nothing to do with this inquisition,” yet the tape was admitted as a joint exhibit. We cannot say that the hearing justice erred by relying upon the tape in assessing Natalie’s credibility.', 'Finally, the hearing justice found defendant’s testimony to be unworthy of belief. She found that, not only did defendant have an incentive to lie, but that his testimony about his own actions, including sleeping and having sex in Natalie’s bed, “radiates control of your victim and manipulation.”', 'Further, the hearing justice noted that, when confronted with his earlier conviction, after a plea of nolo contendere to sexual assault, defendant said that he lied to the court when he admitted, under oath, that he had committed that offense. We are satisfied that the record provides ample support for the hearing justice’s determination that defendant’s testimony was not credible.', 'The defendant’s appeal is based on the argument that the hearing justice’s determination of the credibility of the witnesses before her was arbitrary and capricious. On the contrary, the record discloses that the hearing justice carefully and thoroughly reviewed the testimony and evidence in concluding that she was reasonably satisfied that the defendant failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior. See Ford, 56 A.3d at 468. The hearing justice presided over five days of testimony and was in the best position to assess the credibility of each of the thirteen witnesses who testified before her.', 'We have often stated that we will not “second-guess supportable credibility assessments of a hearing justice in a probation-revocation hearing * * * .”', '- 18 - Id. at 469 (quoting Jackson, 966 A.2d at 1229). We will not do so now. The record of this case reflects ample support for the hearing justice’s credibility assessments.', 'From her unique perspective on the bench, she relied on her own observations of the various witnesses, primarily the complaining witness and the defendant. Based upon our review of the record, we cannot say that her findings were arbitrary or capricious, and we affirm her adjudication of probation violation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.

The defendant took the children on bike rides, bought them candy and ice cream, and gave them gifts. Hannah and her siblings would often go to defendant’s apartment to play his video games. The sixty-year-old defendant, whom the children referred to as “Chucky,” took on the role of “grandfather figure.”', 'Sometime in late June or early July of 2007, the North Providence Police and the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) came to Pamela’s apartment in Woonsocket. They informed Pamela that her ex-boyfriend Pires had confessed to sexually molesting Hannah. Hannah had never said a word to Pamela about Pires touching her. Pamela told Hannah that Pires’ touching was wrongful and stressed the importance of immediately coming forward were something like that ever to happen again.', 'By the start of the school year in 2007, Hannah and defendant had become very close.

This conversation took place in chambers and was unrecorded. Thereafter, over the course of two days, the state presented six witnesses and defendant testified on his own behalf.', 'We summarize below the relevant testimony and events from trial.', 'On the first day of trial, Hannah testified about the specific instances of molestation. She recalled that the first incident occurred on Thanksgiving of 2007. After Thanksgiving dinner, Hannah went downstairs to defendant’s apartment to play video games. While she was sitting on a reclining chair in defendant’s living room, playing a game, defendant approached her and asked her “what an orgasm was.” The defendant then sat down on the arm of the chair and squeezed Hannah’s breast.

When defendant digitally penetrated her, Hannah cried out that defendant was hurting her and told him to stop. Hannah indicated that defendant stopped touching her. Her testimony was unclear as to whether she immediately went upstairs to her family’s apartment after the incident or resumed playing video games for some period of time before leaving defendant’s apartment.', 'Although Hannah was frightened of defendant after the incident on Thanksgiving, she and her younger brother returned to defendant’s apartment the following day to play video games. Hannah was again seated in the reclining chair in defendant’s living room and her brother was seated in a second reclining chair next to her. According to Hannah, defendant pulled down her pants and performed cunnilingus on her. She explained that defendant used a blanket to hide his actions from her brother. 5', 'Hannah testified to at least two other instances of inappropriate sexual touching, but she could not recall specific dates. She stated that on one occasion, defendant touched and licked her breasts. On a separate occasion, defendant used his hand to place Hannah’s hand on his penis.

She later suggested that the incident may have occurred on the day after Thanksgiving, contemporaneous with the acts of cunnilingus.', 'Hannah did not mention to anyone what defendant had done to her until she told her friend Anna. She explained that, sometime after the last incident, defendant had threatened to kill her if she told her mother. 5', 'Hannah’s testimony about defendant’s use of the blanket was somewhat confused. She initially explained that defendant held up the blanket alongside of her. She later testified, however, that defendant “pulled [the blanket] up and it stayed.” Hannah stated that the blanket “was standing.”', '-4-', 'Next, the state presented Hannah’s mother, Pamela. On direct examination, counsel for the state asked Pamela, “did Selina tell you something about * * * [defendant]?” After Pamela answered, “Yes,” defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar to place something on the record. At the sidebar, the following exchange occurred:', '“[Defense Counsel]: I just wanted to state that we had a', 'conference regarding the 304 [sic] or 404(b) evidence regarding', 'Selina, and I did make an objection in chambers.

Pamela answered that Selina had informed her that defendant had touched her breast.', 'Pamela immediately went downstairs to defendant’s apartment to confront him about the incident.', 'According to Pamela’s recounting of the conversation, defendant insisted that his elbow had come into contact with Selina’s nipple while he and Selina were wrestling.', 'Defense counsel then repeatedly questioned Pamela about continuing to allow her children to visit defendant’s apartment:', '“[Defense Counsel]:', 'After that event[,] Selina still went', 'downstairs to visit with [defendant]; correct?', '“[Pamela]: Yes.', '“[Defense Counsel]: And your two other children[,] you allowed', 'them to go downstairs and visit [defendant]; correct?', '“[Pamela]: Yes.', '-5-', '“* * *', '“[Defense Counsel]: You hear of an alleged assault but you still', 'let your children go down and see [defendant]?', '“[Pamela]: Yes.”', 'After Pamela had finished testifying and the jury had left the courtroom, counsel for the state suggested that defense counsel had waived his earlier objection by using the other bad acts evidence to defendant’s advantage on cross-examination.

If [the trial', 'justice] had ruled for me, I would never have questioned that way.” The trial justice stated that he was aware that defense counsel was attempting to preemptively lessen the impact of the other bad acts evidence. He explained that he had therefore decided not to give a cautionary instruction during Pamela’s testimony. The trial justice suggested, however, that he would reconsider giving such an instruction when Selina testified.', 'On the second day of trial, the state presented Selina. She testified that sometime around September of 2007, while she and her younger brother were visiting defendant’s apartment, defendant had reached under her shirt and twisted her nipple. She explained that defendant “would always [twist her nipple] outside my shirt as a joke. For some reason he did it inside my shirt.” At the time of the incident, Selina was just shy of her twelfth birthday and had begun experiencing some breast development. The touching made her uncomfortable. She forcefully', '-6- elbowed defendant to make him stop. Selina then went upstairs and told her mother about defendant’s touching.', 'When she recounted the incident to her mother, Selina tried to minimize the significance of the touching. She intentionally gave her mother the impression that she and defendant were “playing around” and the touching was “not really that big of a deal.” Selina did not want to spoil the fun that she and her siblings had with defendant. She confirmed that, after the incident, her mother continued to allow her and her siblings to visit defendant’s apartment unsupervised. The trial justice did not give a cautionary instruction either during or after Selina’s testimony.', 'The defendant took the stand in his own defense. He denied ever touching Hannah in a sexual manner or forcing Hannah to touch him. The defendant acknowledged that he took more of an interest in Hannah than in the other two children. He felt badly that Hannah’s older sister and children at school teased Hannah. The defendant also denied touching Selina and further denied that he and Pamela had ever had a conversation about his touching Selina.', 'Upon the conclusion of all evidence, the trial justice instructed the jury. He specifically charged the following:', '“Other conduct.

This evidence presented', 'is to be considered by you as the jury only for the limited purpose', 'for which it was received.” The trial justice called a sidebar after he finished his instructions to ask counsel if they had any objections to the charge. Neither counsel for the state nor defense counsel mentioned the', '-7- instruction on “other conduct.” Later that same afternoon, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty on all seven counts of molestation.', 'On July 21, 2011, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Thereafter, on July 29, 2011, defendant filed pro se motions to release his court-appointed trial counsel and to request the appointment of new counsel. Notwithstanding defendant’s motion to release him, trial counsel represented defendant at a hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial on August 4, 2011. In support of defendant’s motion, defense counsel argued that no reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because there were material inconsistencies in Hannah’s and Pamela’s testimony. The defendant was present at the hearing but did not mention his request for new counsel.', 'In ruling on defendant’s motion, the trial justice explained that the analysis of a new-trial motion required him to consider the evidence in light of the charge to the jury and determine whether reasonable minds could differ. In applying this analysis, however, the trial justice stated, “[i]t’s not necessary for this [c]ourt to go through the first two prongs [of the analysis for a new trial motion] because based on the evidence this [c]ourt heard, this [c]ourt is in complete agreement with the jury in this case * * *.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'On November 2, 2011, the date originally scheduled for sentencing, the trial justice instead heard defendant’s pro se motion for the appointment of new counsel. The defendant expressed his dissatisfaction with his court-appointed trial counsel and averred that counsel had not contacted him since trial to explain sentencing. Defense counsel stated that he had not contacted defendant because he believed that, as a court-appointed attorney, he was duty-bound', '-8- not to bill the state for any further work on defendant’s case once he had received defendant’s motion to have him withdraw as counsel. He assured the trial justice that he was willing to represent defendant at sentencing, provided that defendant would cooperate with him.', 'The trial justice informed defendant that the proper vehicle to address the adequacy of his counsel’s representation is an application for postconviction relief. He emphasized that trial counsel was in a better position to represent defendant at sentencing than a new attorney who would have to rely solely on a transcript, without the benefit of having witnessed what occurred at trial. The trial justice concluded that defendant had failed to offer an adequate reason to justify further delaying the final resolution of the case. He therefore denied defendant’s request for new counsel.', 'On November 10, 2011, the trial justice sentenced defendant on each count of first- degree molestation to forty years, twenty-eight years to serve and twelve years suspended with probation, and six years to serve on each count of second-degree molestation, all counts to run concurrently.', 'On November 15, 2011, defendant filed an appeal to this Court. 6', 'A final judgment of conviction and commitment entered on March 20, 2012. 7', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Mitchell contends that the trial justice erred in admitting evidence of his alleged molestation of Selina.

As we have explained, however, a trial justice’s pretrial ruling to admit evidence is often not a final determination. Merida, 960 A.2d at 238 n.20. Moreover, we note that defendant failed to create any record of the substance of the trial justice’s ruling, which apparently took place in chambers. Ordinarily, we will not review a defendant’s allegation of error where the defendant has failed to preserve on the record a conversation transpiring in chambers. See State v. Toro, 684 A.2d 1147, 1149 (R.I. 1996). In this case, however, we need not pass on the preservation issues because defendant’s arguments are unpersuasive even if preserved.', '- 11 -', 'Rule 404(b) prohibits the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts “to show the defendant’s propensity to commit the crime with which he [or she] is currently charged.” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 199 (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 926 (R.I. 2005)). Thus, in molestation or sexual assault cases, the state may not offer evidence of a defendant’s other sexual misconduct “to prove that [the] ‘defendant is a bad man, and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore, probably committed the offenses with which he is charged.’” State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 806 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996)). Rule 404(b) allows, however, for the introduction of evidence of other bad acts if offered for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake. See id.', 'Even when one of Rule 404(b)’s exceptions is applicable, however, we have held that evidence of a defendant’s sexual misconduct involving someone other than the complainant 8 must meet additional requirements before its admission. State v. Coningford, 901 A.2d 623, 627 (R.I. 2006). The proffered evidence must involve a nonremote similar offense. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806. “In addition, the evidence is admissible ‘only when [the] exception is relevant to proving the charge lodged against the defendant,’ and ‘only when reasonably necessary.’” Coningford, 901 A.2d at 627 (quoting Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806). Finally, “in sexual assault cases * * * a trial justice is required to issue a cautionary instruction to the jury regarding the limited use of Rule 404(b) evidence even in the absence of a specific request by defense counsel to do so.” State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000). 8', 'We have consistently distinguished evidence of other sexual misconduct involving the complainant from that involving different victims. See State v.

Only the former may be admitted to show the defendant’s “lewd disposition.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 n.4. Thus, the “lewd disposition” exception is not applicable to the instant matter.', '- 12 -', 'In this case, there is no dispute that the evidence of defendant’s touching Selina was nonremote and sufficiently similar to the charged offenses. Instead, defendant argues that the evidence of his alleged molestation of Selina was not relevant to prove any of the exceptions to Rule 404(b). We disagree. Although defendant asserts that intent was not at issue in this case, defendant was charged with five counts of second-degree child molestation. Second-degree molestation is a specific-intent crime that requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant touched the victim “for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Coningford, 901 A.2d at 630 (quoting §§ 11-37-1(7) and 11-37-8.3). We have held on more than one occasion that, when a defendant is charged with second-degree molestation, similar incidents involving other victims are admissible to demonstrate the defendant’s intent to sexually gratify. See, e.g., Dubois, 36 A.3d at 201; Coningford, 901 A.2d at 629; Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808. Evidence that defendant touched Selina’s nipple at a time when her breasts were developing was relevant to show defendant’s specific intent to sexually gratify.', 'The defendant additionally argues that the evidence of his alleged molestation of Selina was not reasonably necessary. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, this Court has stated that “[w]hen charges of sexual abuse hinge upon a credibility contest between defendant and child complainant, relevant evidence of prior sexual misconduct is reasonably necessary to support the complainant’s testimony.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808 (citing State v. Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 187 (R.I. 1997)). Here, there was no physical evidence and no eyewitness testimony presented at trial. As defendant acknowledges, this case turned entirely upon whether the jury believed Hannah. Thus, the evidence of defendant’s touching Selina was reasonably necessary to support Hannah’s credibility.', '- 13 -', 'Finally, we conclude that the trial justice fulfilled his obligation to give a sua sponte instruction on the Rule 404(b) evidence.', 'The requisite instruction need not be given contemporaneously with the relevant testimony. See Merida, 960 A.2d at 238 n.18. In this case, the trial justice included a cautionary instruction on other bad acts when he instructed the jury at the close of all evidence. Any issue as to the adequacy of that instruction is waived since defendant did not raise an objection prior to the jury’s deliberations. See State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009) (“[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge * * * unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict * * *.” (quoting Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure)). After considering all of defendant’s arguments and carefully reviewing the record, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s admission of evidence of defendant’s other sexual misconduct.', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice’s decision to deny his motion for a new trial is not entitled to deference because the trial justice failed to complete the proper analysis. We afford deference to a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a new trial so long as the trial justice has complied with the proper procedure and articulated adequate reasoning. Covington, 69 A.3d at 863. When ruling on a motion for a new trial under Rule 33, the trial justice must complete three steps to fulfill his or her role as the thirteenth juror: “[t]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Smith, 39 A.3d at 673).', '“If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict', '- 14 - should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (citing State v. Snow, 670 A.2d 239, 244 (R.I. 1996)).', 'On a motion for a new trial, “the record ‘should reflect a few sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.’” State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 71 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 766 (R.I. 2011)). A trial justice need not, however, refer to all of the evidence supporting his or her decision. Guerra, 12 A.3d at 766. “The trial justice ‘need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.’” Id. (quoting State v Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994)).', 'Taken out of context, the trial justice’s comment that performing the first two steps of the new trial analysis was “not necessary” might give the impression that the trial justice neglected his judicial duties. In the next breath, however, the trial justice clearly stated that he “agrees with the [jury’s] outcome based on an independent review of [the] evidence * * *.” He expressly found defendant’s testimony to be “less than candid.” While the trial justice indicated that he would reserve extended comments for sentencing, he summed up the case as “a man of over 60 years old [who] molested an eight-year-old girl, asked her if she knew what an orgasm was, pulled down her pants, and had her touch his penis.”', 'Based on this record, it is sufficiently clear that the trial justice independently reviewed the evidence most relevant to the molestation charges.', 'It is also clear that he rejected defendant’s testimony and instead chose to credit the contrary testimony of one or more of the state’s witnesses. Cf. State v. Medina, 747 A.2d 448, 449 (R.I. 2000) (trial justice’s acceptance of state’s witness’s testimony was sufficient on motion for a new trial to communicate that trial justice was rejecting any contrary factual testimony). Although we emphasize that the better practice is for a trial justice to perform each step of the analysis on the record, we are satisfied in', '- 15 - this case that the trial justice applied the appropriate standards by independently reviewing the relevant testimony and assessing the credibility of the witnesses. Accordingly, his decision is entitled to the usual deference and will not be reversed absent a clear error or a misconception of material evidence.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence that called into doubt the credibility of Hannah, Selina, and Pamela. Echoing the arguments that he made below, defendant suggests on appeal that it is unbelievable that Selina and Hannah would willingly return, with Pamela’s permission, to defendant’s apartment after he had allegedly molested them. He also claims that, since Pamela had explained to Hannah the importance of speaking up about Pires’ molestation, it is incredible that Hannah would remain silent about defendant’s molestation. We find defendant’s arguments unavailing.', 'The “trial justice[] * * * experience[s] firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (quoting State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011)). Thus, this Court affords great deference to the credibility assessments of a trial justice “who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity * * * to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” Id. (quoting State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010)).', 'In this case, Selina described at trial how she had minimized defendant’s touching of her breast when she recounted the incident to her mother. Pamela testified that defendant gave her a similar innocuous explanation for the incident. The trial justice, as the first-hand observer, was entitled to credit their testimony and find it plausible that Pamela would continue to allow her children to visit defendant’s apartment. In addition, the trial justice was entitled to accept Hannah’s testimony that defendant threatened to kill her if she disclosed his abuse to her mother.', '- 16 - Finally, it was clearly the trial justice’s prerogative to choose to believe that an eight-year-old girl, who was teased by her peers and her sister, might return to the apartment of an elderly neighbor who had brought her gifts, allowed her to play his games, and shown a special preference for her, despite her doubts about his behavior. We therefore hold that the trial justice did not clearly err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'C', 'Request for the Appointment of New Counsel', 'A criminal defendant’s “right to obtain counsel ‘is not an unqualified one.’” State v. Bruyere, 751 A.2d 1285, 1287-88 (R.I. 2000) (quoting State v. Kennedy, 586 A.2d 1089, 1091 (R.I. 1991)). A motion requesting the appointment of alternate or new counsel, if granted, requires the hearing justice to continue a matter and ultimately delays the case’s disposition. See Powell, 6 A.3d at 1086. Thus, “[a] hearing justice’s decision to grant or deny a request for alternate counsel requires a balancing of the presumption in favor of the defendant’s right to * * * counsel of [his] choice and the public’s interest in the prompt, effective, and efficient administration of justice.” State v. Lancellotta, 35 A.3d 863, 867 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Powell, 6 A.3d at 1086).

The trial justice concluded that defendant’s trial counsel was in a better position to make such an argument than a newly appointed attorney who would be forced to rely solely on a transcript, without having witnessed the events at trial. Accordingly, the trial justice stated that the relevant factors did not weigh in favor of delaying sentencing in order to discharge trial counsel, appoint new counsel, and wait for new counsel to read the transcripts. We discern no error in the trial justice’s reasoning.', 'The defendant nevertheless endeavors to persuade us to overturn the trial justice’s decision by directing our attention to State v. Farman, 600 A.2d 726 (R.I. 1992). He argues that in his case, as in Farman, there was a complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. In Farman, we held that, based on the “unusual circumstances” of that case, it was prejudicial error for the trial justice to deny the defendant’s request for a continuance. See id. at 728. After the defendant in Farman had already paid $1,000 to one attorney to investigate the charges against', '- 18 - him, the first attorney assigned the defendant’s case to a second attorney who threatened to withdraw unless the defendant paid an additional $2,500 for investigative services. See id. at 726-27. Not only did the second attorney fail to investigate the charges against the defendant, he moved to withdraw in open court on the day trial was scheduled to begin. See id. at 727. That same day, a third attorney whom the defendant had retained to represent him requested a continuance to prepare for trial. See id. The trial justice denied both the second attorney’s motion to withdraw and the third attorney’s motion for a continuance. See id.', 'The exceptional facts in Farman are readily distinguishable from those in the instant case. Here, the defendant did not have another attorney ready to pinch-hit. In addition, the defendant’s trial counsel did not move to withdraw at the eleventh hour but instead stood up at the hearing and assured the trial justice of his willingness to represent the defendant at sentencing. Finally, the trial justice in this case granted a continuance to enable counsel to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly, we uphold the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s request for new counsel.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.

103,: v. : Mario Rosario. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This appeal arises out of a seven-day jury trial resulting from an automobile collision that occurred more than ten years ago. The jury found that the plaintiff, Eloisa Gomes (plaintiff or Gomes), failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant, Mario Rosario (defendant or Rosario), was negligent.1 The trial justice, however, granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, finding that the jury’s assignment of “no liability to the defendant demonstrates that this court’s instructions were not clear or properly understood or applied by the jury in this case.”2 The defendant contends on appeal that the trial justice erred in granting a new trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'During the afternoon of September 23, 2003, Gomes, a certified nursing assistant, was driving from the home of one patient to the home of another; she was traveling south to north on 1', 'Although Armando Gomes still appears in the case caption, prior to trial, the parties entered a stipulation dismissing “his claims for loss of consortium damages” and indicating that he would “no longer continue as a plaintiff in the above captioned matter.” 2', 'The trial justice also denied plaintiff’s motion for additur because the jury found in favor of defendant and therefore awarded no damages to which an additur could attach.', '-1- Pine Street in Pawtucket. At the same time, Rosario was driving home from a bank, traveling west to east on Marrin Street. It is undisputed that the vehicles operated by Gomes and Rosario collided in the intersection—governed by a traffic light—bisecting Pine Street and Marrin Street.3 The circumstances that led to that collision comprised the bulk of the relevant testimony at trial.4', 'Two independent eyewitnesses testified at trial: Isabel Baldera (Baldera) and Robert Smith (Smith).5 Baldera testified that she was on her way to work on the day of the accident and that she was stopped behind another vehicle in the right lane on Marrin Street. While waiting at the red light, Baldera noticed a red truck in her mirror. She testified that the truck, driven by Rosario, passed her on the left and proceeded through a red light into the intersection. Meanwhile, she testified that Gomes was proceeding down Pine Street, with a green light, and that she slowly entered the intersection. Baldera testified that the vehicles collided in the intersection and “[t]he front of [Rosario’s] truck hit the front left side of [Gomes’s vehicle].” Baldera admitted, however, that she did not see that Gomes had a green light directly, but rather assumed so because she (Baldera) had a red light.', 'Smith, the second eyewitness, testified that he was driving on Marrin Street on his way home from work as a taxi driver on the day of the accident. His testimony was in agreement with previous witnesses that Marrin Street was a one-way roadway and three lanes wide, and he stated that he was the first vehicle stopped at a red light in the middle lane. Smith testified that, 3', 'Pine Street and Marrin Street are one-way streets and are perpendicular to each other. 4', 'There was also a significant amount of testimony on damages at trial. This Court, however, only recounts the testimony relevant to the jury’s finding and the trial justice’s decision on the motion for a new trial. 5', 'Because Baldera was not available to testify at trial, her testimony was video-recorded and played for the jury.', '-2- while stopped at the red light, he saw Rosario’s truck pass him on the right and drive through the red light. As this was happening, Smith observed Gomes’s small, blue car traveling down Pine Street. He testified that both cars were traveling at around twenty miles per hour. Smith testified that when the cars collided, Rosario’s truck hit Gomes’s “right broadside.” Then the following colloquy ensued:', '“Q. What part of his [Rosario’s] car hit her [Gomes’s] car?', '“A. His front right.', '“Q. That would be the front passenger side?', '“A. No, the other side.', '“Q. And what part of her car was hit?', '“A. The front part of her -- the front part of her car.” Smith testified that, after the initial collision, Rosario’s truck hit a fence and Gomes’s car remained in the middle of the road.', 'Pawtucket Police Officer Hermano Pereira (Officer Pereira) investigated the accident. Although he testified that he did not recollect the incident at the time of trial, he testified about the contents of a police report that he prepared on the day of the accident. The police report, admitted as a full trial exhibit, contained a diagram of the damaged areas of the vehicles. Officer Pereira testified that the diagram showed damage to the front, front right, front left, and the left and right sides near the doors of Rosario’s vehicle. The diagram also depicted damage to the front, front right, and front left of Gomes’s vehicle. Based on his conversations with Baldera, Smith, Gomes, and Rosario, Officer Pereira issued a citation to Rosario for failure to obey a traffic control device. Pawtucket Municipal Court records indicate that the ticket was paid and not contested by Rosario.', '-3-', 'Gomes testified that she was working as a certified nursing assistant and traveling between patients on September 23, 2003. She testified that she was driving in the left lane of Pine Street at about twenty miles per hour. Gomes testified that she had a green light and entered the intersection, but at about the middle of the intersection she “heard the impact with [Rosario’s] car.” She testified that her car spun around, made a second impact on the left side, and finally hit a sidewalk. According to Gomes, a photograph depicting the damage to her driver’s side rear door was the result of the second impact. On cross-examination, Gomes stated that the initial impact involved the front of her car, but she could not remember what part of Rosario’s truck was hit or which vehicle struck the other vehicle.', 'Rosario testified that he was traveling west to east on Pine Street and proceeding at ten to fifteen miles per hour. He contended that the traffic light was green “constantly” and that, as he approached the intersection, he saw Gomes’s car approaching at a high rate of speed from fifty feet away. Despite acknowledging that he saw Gomes’s car entering the intersection and his testimony that he was traveling only at ten to fifteen miles per hour, when asked why he did not brake to avoid the accident, Rosario responded, “I panic right there.” Rosario testified that the front of Gomes’s car contacted the front of his truck near the door. According to Rosario, after the collision, his truck’s passenger-side front wheel and door were damaged as a result of the accident. Rosario testified that, after the collision, his truck traveled onto a grassy area and hit a fence. He testified that he had the truck repaired and never took any pictures of the damage. Finally, he testified that he did not contest the traffic citation because he wanted to “get over with it” and that he “didn’t want any problem.”', 'The jury found that Gomes had not proven, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that Rosario was negligent. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the verdict failed', '-4- to respond to the evidence, and, in a bench decision, the trial justice granted the motion and ordered a new trial. The trial justice found both of the independent, neutral witnesses, Baldera and Smith, to be “highly credible.” Regarding the testimony of the parties, he noted that both Gomes and Rosario had an interest in the outcome of the trial and pointed to inconsistencies and a lack of clarity in their testimony. The trial justice acknowledged the dispute over the initial point of impact between the vehicles and the lane of travel of each party, but found “the issue of who struck whom and the lane of travel [were] not material to the inquiry of whether there was any liability.” The trial justice accorded “some weight” to the guilty disposition of the citation issued to defendant.

Specifically, he noted that Baldera testified that “[s]he observed the defendant driving his car at a high rate of speed, go through the red light, and strike the plaintiff’s automobile.”6 The trial justice determined that all of Baldera’s testimony “was highly credible and that there was no evidence that showed any bias or prejudice to either party.” Similarly, the trial justice noted that Smith testified that defendant ran a red light and concluded that his testimony was highly credible and without bias or prejudice toward either party. Although when discussing the testimony of the parties, the trial justice did not specifically state whether or not he found them credible, he did note that each had an interest in the case.', 'In addition to recounting their testimony—each contending that he or she had a green light—the trial justice pointed to some inconsistencies in Gomes’s testimony and a lack of detail in Rosario’s testimony.

That averment is not only self-serving, it is also belied by the fact that Rosario did not challenge the traffic citation, a fact to which the trial justice accorded “some weight.” The overwhelming evidence—testimony by two independent witnesses that Rosario ran a red light—as well as his failure to stop despite his admission that he saw plaintiff’s vehicle ahead of time, does not comport with the jury’s finding that defendant was not negligent in light of the negligence instruction.7 Thus, the trial justice had a sufficient basis to find that the jury’s verdict did not respond to the evidence.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material facts. As discussed herein, the trial justice found the most significant evidence to be the testimony of Baldera and Smith.', 'He did not overlook contrary facts—he actually raised some of the inconsistencies, such as the lane of travel and who hit whom, and found them to be “not material to the inquiry of whether there was any liability.”8 Because the trial justice is closer to the 7', 'The trial justice instructed the jury that negligence is defined, generally, as “the failure of one person acting in a given set of circumstances to exercise that degree of care for the safety of another person that a reasonably prudent person would ordinarily exercise in the same or similar conditions.” The trial justice also instructed the jury that they could consider a violation of traffic and motor vehicle laws as evidence of negligence.

104,: v. : Dennis Hoag. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this dispute between neighbors, George E. Morabit (plaintiff or Morabit) appeals from several adverse rulings rendered by a Washington County Superior Court trial justice. On appeal, he argues that the trial justice committed reversible error in: (1) denying his request to depose a proposed lay witness; (2) refusing to certify one of his witnesses as an expert in the study of historic stone walls; (3) denying his motion to amend his complaint; (4) granting the defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law; and (5) denying his motion for a new trial. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1986, Dennis Hoag (defendant or Hoag) acquired land located at 385 Snuff Mill Road in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. In 1991, Morabit purchased approximately fifty-three acres of property, abutting immediately to the north of defendant’s property. Morabit’s property is', '-1- mostly undeveloped woodland. 1 A stone wall demarcates the boundary between the northern edge of Hoag’s land and the southern edge of plaintiff’s property.', 'While walking his property sometime in the early 2000s, Morabit discovered that a large portion of the stone wall had been destroyed. Just north of the stone wall, a significant number of trees were missing. After receiving no response to several letters that his counsel sent to Hoag, Morabit filed a complaint in Washington County Superior Court on April 27, 2005. In his complaint, Morabit sought to recover damages from Hoag under G.L. 1956 § 34-20-1 (count 2). That statute renders any person who engages in the unauthorized cutting, destroying, or carrying away of any trees, timber, or wood liable to the property owner for twice the value of the trees cut or destroyed and three times the value of the wood. 2', 'Morabit also alleged that he was entitled to damages for Hoag’s destruction or removal of the stone wall under G.L. 1956 § 9-1-2 and G.L. 1956 § 11-41-32 (count 3). 3 Section 11-41-32 states that any person convicted of the theft of an historic stone wall, or a portion of an historic 1', 'Of the fifty-three acres, plaintiff retains development rights for approximately seventeen acres, having donated the development rights for the remaining acreage to the Town of North Kingstown. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-20-1provides:', '“Every person who shall cut, destroy, or carry away any', 'tree, timber, wood or underwood whatsoever, lying or growing on', 'the land of any other person, without leave of the owner thereof,', 'shall, for every such trespass, pay the party injured twice the value', 'of any tree so cut, destroyed, or carried away; and for the wood or', 'underwood, thrice the value thereof; to be recovered by civil', 'action.” 3', 'In his complaint, Morabit also alleged that Hoag had unlawfully interfered with an easement that Morabit possesses over Hoag’s land (count 1). Morabit requested injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent any further alteration of his property and any further interference with the easement (counts 4 and 5). The existence of the easement was not disputed during the proceedings below and the parties agreed to preserve all rights, responsibilities, and privileges relating to the easement. The easement is not at issue in the instant appeal.', '-2- stone wall, shall be guilty of larceny. Subsection (d) of § 11-41-32 provides that anyone convicted of stealing an historic stone wall shall be civilly liable to the property owner for the cost of replacing the stones and any other compensable damages. 4 Section 9-1-2 provides civil liability for criminal offenses. Under that provision, a plaintiff may recover civil damages for injury to his or her estate that results from the commission of a crime or offense, irrespective of whether charges have been filed against the offender.', 'On January 23, 2009, three days before a trial on plaintiff’s claims was scheduled to commence, plaintiff moved for a continuance. Counsel for plaintiff indicated that she had been unable to make contact with Bruce Walker, a former neighbor of Hoag’s who was expected to testify as a percipient witness on Morabit’s behalf. When trial commenced on the morning of January 27, 2009, counsel for plaintiff informed the court that she had learned on the previous afternoon that Mr. Walker was confined to a nursing home with an infection. Counsel requested permission to depose Mr. Walker at the nursing home, emphasizing that Mr. Walker was the only witness who could testify directly to Hoag’s activities during the relevant time period. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-41-32 is known as the “Leona Kelley Act,” in honor of the late South Kingstown state representative, Leona Kelley.

She reasoned that plaintiff had ample opportunity before trial to take Mr. Walker’s deposition. The trial justice further noted that, given Mr. Walker’s advanced age of eighty-four years, plaintiff should have anticipated the need to preserve Mr. Walker’s testimony.', 'After the trial justice denied plaintiff’s discovery request, the case opened to a jury. Over the course of a six-day trial, the jury heard from multiple witnesses, reviewed several exhibits, and took a view of the property. We summarize below the evidence most relevant to the instant appeal.', 'Morabit testified on his own behalf. He stated that, when he purchased his property in 1991, work was under way on Hoag’s parcel.', 'In particular, Morabit testified that he had observed “constant clearing[] of trees” from Hoag’s land and “dump truck load upon dump truck load of fill coming into [Hoag’s] property.” Morabit indicated that, in addition to the dump trucks, other heavy equipment, including excavators, bulldozers, and backhoes, had been present on defendant’s property at one time or another during construction. He estimated that the work on defendant’s property had lasted for a period of ten years or more. Morabit further indicated that he and Hoag have had a less than congenial relationship since becoming neighbors in 1991.', 'Morabit described the scope of the damage that he observed on the southern part of his property. He estimated that the semicircular area of missing trees was roughly 400 feet long with a radius of sixty to eighty feet. Morabit believed that the missing trees were predominantly of the tupelo variety, which he asserted is a rare and historic species. The stone wall, he noted, “was destroyed and what was left in its place were various boulders that did not come from [his] property.” Morabit testified that stones from the wall appeared to have been pushed from the', '-4- direction of Hoag’s property towards his property. According to his estimate, the damaged portion of the wall extended 300 to 400 feet.', 'The plaintiff presented witness Robert Thorson, a professor of geology at the University of Connecticut with an expertise in human impacts on the landscape.', 'Professor Thorson specified that he focuses on the study of historic stone walls. He stated that he has published three books and numerous articles relating to stone walls. Professor Thorson also indicated that he has testified in court on the subject of stone walls on at least one prior occasion.', 'After defendant objected to recognizing Professor Thorson as an expert, the trial justice conducted a voir dire hearing, outside the presence of the jury, on the admissibility of his testimony. The trial justice ultimately recognized Professor Thorson as an expert in the field of geology but precluded any testimony based on stone wall science. She reasoned that the study of historic stone walls was unreliable because it had not garnered sufficient acceptance in the scientific community or been subjected to adequate peer review. The trial justice clarified, however, that Professor Thorson could offer opinions concerning stone walls to the extent those opinions were based upon his knowledge of geology.', 'Thereafter, Professor Thorson testified that he had twice visited Morabit’s property and prepared a report based on his study of the property. He characterized the segment of stone wall marking the north-south boundary of the parties’ properties as an “old historic wall” and “an established * * * boundary line wall[.]” It was Professor Thorson’s opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the stone wall was deliberately destroyed by a backhoe, bulldozer, or other piece of heavy equipment pushing the stones in the direction of Morabit’s property.', 'Professor Thorson had formed this opinion based on his observations of the arrangement, characteristics, and concentration of the stones scattered in the area immediately', '-5- surrounding the damaged portion of the wall. He estimated that the altered portion of the wall stretched for a length of approximately 120 feet. He did not offer an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the damaged wall.', 'The plaintiff also called Matthew Largess, an expert in arboriculture science. 5 Mr. Largess stated that he has been a professional arborist in Rhode Island for twenty-two years and has worked in the forestry business for thirty-five years. Mr. Largess testified that he first visited plaintiff’s property in August 2005. He explained that during his first visit he had observed an area of clear-cutting just north and west of the stone wall, encompassing an area of approximately 135 feet by one hundred feet. In November 2008, Mr. Largess returned to the property to take samples of the young trees that had begun to grow back in the cleared area. Based on the age of the sampled trees, Mr. Largess estimated that the clear-cutting had occurred six to seven years earlier, placing the time of removal sometime around 2001 to 2002.', 'Mr. Largess further testified that he visited plaintiff’s property again on January 15, 2009.', 'Mr. Largess offered an opinion as to the numbers, species, and ages of the missing trees. Although there were no stumps remaining when he visited the property, Mr. Largess explained that he could estimate the number of trees removed based on his observations of the surrounding tree groves. Using his study of the adjacent forest, Mr. Largess estimated that 190 trees were removed. He additionally estimated that the relative composition of the missing trees was 70 percent tupelos, 20 percent red maples, 5 percent poplars, and 5 percent black oaks. Mr. Largess explained that tupelo trees share a “mat” of roots and tend to grow in densely packed groves, such that a large number of tupelos often grow in a relatively small area. Based on core samples 5', '“Arboriculture” is defined as “[t]he planting and care of woody plants, especially trees.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 91 (5th ed. 2011).', '-6- taken from the surrounding forest, it was Mr. Largess’s opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the missing trees were between eighty and one hundred years old.', 'Mr. Largess explained that he had prepared an estimate of the value of the missing trees by applying the Purdue University Method of tree appraisal (Purdue method). 6 He explained that the first step in applying the formula is to determine the “base value” of the tree being appraised. Literature from the Purdue University Department of Horticulture, admitted into evidence at trial, describes the base value as “the dollar amount assigned to one cross-section unit (square inch or square centimeter) of a tree’s trunk cross-section area.” Mr. Largess testified that the base value is typically calculated by obtaining a quote from one or more nurseries for the cost of a replacement tree.', 'Mr. Largess explained that the base value is then adjusted according to four characteristics of the tree being appraised: (1) size; (2) species class; (3) condition class; and (4) location class. The latter three factors are expressed as a percentage from one to one hundred. The percentage value for species class is assessed according to the tree’s form, color, growth habit, strength, and longevity. The value for condition class reflects the tree’s health, vigor, and life expectancy. Location class takes into consideration the functional and aesthetic contribution of the tree to the site. A “real good tree,” Mr. Largess explained, would receive a value of 100 percent for each factor, while a “junk tree” would be assessed a value of 1 percent. A final estimate of the cost of the tree is obtained by multiplying the base value by the values for size, species class, condition class, and location class. 6', 'According to Mr. Largess, the Purdue method is widely used by both insurance companies and government agencies to appraise trees. He further asserted that the Purdue method has undergone peer review and is accepted among arborists as a reliable method for valuing trees.', '-7-', 'Mr. Largess then described how he applied the Purdue method to assess the value of the trees removed from Morabit’s property. Mr. Largess explained that tupelo trees are rare and often hard to acquire from a nursery. He further stated that nurseries do not sell tupelo trees of a size equal to that of the eighty to one-hundred-year-old trees removed from Morabit’s property. Accordingly, Mr. Largess performed his calculations based on the cost of the largest tupelo tree available at a nursery. 7 He assigned a value of 100 percent for species, condition, and location class. The 100 percent score was warranted, according to Mr. Largess, because of tupelos’ longevity, resistance to pests and disease, colorful fall foliage, and location in a large and beautiful wetland area. Through application of the formula, he assessed the value of each missing tupelo tree at approximately $3,000. Based on his estimate that 70 percent of the trees removed from the property were tupelos, Mr. Largess calculated a total loss of $399,000 for the missing tupelo trees (.7 x 190 x $3000). He admitted that tupelos have no value as lumber or firewood but clarified that the Purdue method was intended to capture a tree’s ecological and aesthetic value, rather than its commercial value.', 'Mr. Largess performed the same computations for the three remaining species of trees. He assigned the red maples a value of 80 percent for each of species class, condition class, and location class. For the missing black oak trees, he determined the values for species class, condition class, and location class to be 80 percent, 80 percent, and 90 percent, respectively. Mr. Largess gave the missing poplars a species class value of 40 percent, a condition class value of 80 percent, and a location class value of 80 percent. He valued the missing red maples, poplars, 7', 'The article from the Purdue University Department of Horticulture explains that the Purdue method “is in widespread use for large, individual trees, which exceed the size that is usually transplanted. It is a hybrid of the replacement cost method and a process of extending that cost to larger plants.”', '-8- and black oaks at $29,171, $2,430, and $8,207, respectively. Mr. Largess assessed the total value of the 190 missing trees at $439,600.', 'The plaintiff’s final expert was Linda Steere, a wetlands and wildlife biologist who specializes in interpreting aerial photographs. Ms. Steere showed the jury a series of aerial photographs taken of the north-south boundary of the parties’ properties in the years 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2008. To a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, it was Ms. Steere’s opinion that the clearing of the trees and alteration of the stone wall occurred sometime between 1999 and 2003. She further opined that work was being performed on Hoag’s property during those years. According to Ms. Steere, the only access for heavy equipment onto the southern portion of Morabit’s property would have been through Hoag’s property.', 'At the close of plaintiff’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment as a matter of law. 8 In support of his motion, defendant argued that (1) plaintiff had failed to introduce any direct evidence that Hoag removed trees from plaintiff’s property; and (2) Mr. Largess’s evidence of damages was based on mere speculation and was therefore insufficient to go to the jury. After both parties had presented arguments concerning the trees, the trial justice prompted, “Is anybody going to say anything about the wall?” In response, defendant asserted that there was no evidence of an appropriate measure of damages for the stone wall. The plaintiff explained that Professor Thorson had been expected to give an estimate of the cost of restoring the wall but 8', 'The defendant’s counsel referred to the motion as one for a “directed verdict.” As this Court has previously explained, “[t]he standard for granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law is the same as that applicable to its precursor, a motion for a directed verdict.” Adams v. Uno Restaurants, Inc., 794 A.2d 489, 491 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Martinelli v. Hopkins, 787 A.2d 1158, 1165 (R.I. 2001)).', '-9- was precluded from doing so. 9 The plaintiff suggested that the trial justice should nonetheless submit the issue of liability to the jury. If the jury found in plaintiff’s favor on liability, the trial justice could grant equitable relief in lieu of damages. The trial justice pointed out, however, that plaintiff had failed to prove a criminal conviction for theft of the stone wall, as required to recover under § 11-41-32(d). The plaintiff then suggested that he be allowed under Rule 15(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure to amend his pleadings to conform to the evidence.', 'The trial justice denied plaintiff’s request to amend. She reasoned that, even if she allowed the amendment, there was no measure of damages for the stone wall and equitable relief was inappropriate since the damage to the wall was not irreparable or incapable of quantification. She therefore granted defendant’s motion for a judgment as a matter of law with respect to plaintiff’s claim for the stone wall (count 3). The trial justice reserved ruling on defendant’s motion with respect to the removal of the trees (count 2) but emphasized that she was troubled by plaintiff’s measure of damages.', 'Trial continued with the presentation of defendant’s evidence. Hoag testified on his own behalf. He explained that he began clearing his property in 1988 or 1989. 10 According to Hoag, he brought in loads of fill in an effort to increase the elevation of his lot by several feet. He testified that he began constructing a residence on the lot sometime around 2000. Hoag admitted 9', 'The plaintiff avers that, during a colloquy that took place in chambers, the trial justice denied his express request that Professor Thorson be allowed to testify as to damages. On the record, counsel for plaintiff explained, “we originally intended to have [Professor] Thorson * * * testify to a restoration value on the wall and give a dollar amount of damages. That did not happen. We did have an estimate prepared, but, unfortunately, that person who prepared it was not able to testify to it.” 10', 'Hoag admitted that in 1990, he entered a consent agreement with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), wherein he agreed to remove some of the fill he added to his property and re-plant trees in exchange for the DEM’s releasing him of liability for several alleged violations.', '- 10 - that he hired professionals to remove tree stumps from his land using a backhoe but denied removing any trees from Morabit’s property. He avowed that he had no reason to remove trees from Morabit’s land, emphasizing that such a task could only have been accomplished through great expense and effort. Hoag also admitted that he ordered a backhoe operator to place large boulders on top of the stone wall in an effort to prevent Morabit’s cows from entering upon his land. He expressly denied removing any stones from the wall. Prior to his house’s completion in 2005, Hoag did not live on the property and only visited the site on weekends to oversee construction. The defendant did not present any evidence to rebut or contradict plaintiff’s evidence on the value of the missing trees.', 'At the close of all evidence, defendant renewed his motion for a judgment as a matter of law. The defendant essentially reiterated the arguments he had made in support of his earlier motion. The trial justice once again informed counsel that she was concerned that the Purdue method was not an appropriate method for valuing trees. She suggested that Mr. Largess’s estimate of $439,600 would exceed the fair market value of the undeveloped land and thus, result in a windfall to plaintiff. According to the trial justice, the appropriate measure of damages was the difference in the fair market value of the land before and after the trees’ removal.', 'Despite her concerns about Mr. Largess’s methodology, the trial justice ultimately concluded that the fatal flaw in plaintiff’s case was his failure to introduce evidence of the trees’ value at the time of removal. Relying on Tortolano v. DiFilippo, 115 R.I. 496, 349 A.2d 48 (1975), she declared that damages should have been assessed as of the date of injury. In concluding that Mr. Largess’s estimate was not calculated as of the date of injury, the trial justice noted that Mr. Largess had placed telephone calls to various nurseries in order to come up with a base value for each species of tree. Based on Mr. Largess’s testimony, the trial justice assumed', '- 11 - that Mr. Largess made those calls sometime between 2005 and 2009. She instructed that “[t]he proper inquiry would have been what was the replacement cost of a tupelo, a red maple, a poplar or a black oak in 2001, which is when the loss occurred.” The failure of Mr. Largess to make such an inquiry, the trial justice reasoned, deprived his opinion of all probative value. Accordingly, she granted defendant’s motion for a judgment as a matter of law with respect to plaintiff’s claim for the trees (count 2).', 'An order entered on February 23, 2009 granting judgments as a matter of law in defendant’s favor on counts 2 and 3. 11', 'On March 4, 2009, plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff argued that he was entitled to a new trial based on several errors that the trial justice had committed during the course of the proceedings, including her grants of judgments as a matter of law. The trial justice heard arguments on plaintiff’s motion on April 3, 2009. In support of his argument that judgment as a matter of law was improperly granted, plaintiff asserted that an action for trespass 12 does not require a showing of damages. He further argued that, since Mr. Largess did not indicate whether the replacement values for the trees were based on data from 2001, it was improper for the trial justice to assume that the estimate of damages was based on data from 2005 to 2009.', 'In a succinct bench ruling rendered on May 8, 2009, the trial justice stated that she was “still satisfied that if the tree replacement cost was not the cost at the time of the loss, then the 11', 'In her order, the trial justice stated that her decision to grant judgments as a matter of law in defendant’s favor on counts 2 and 3 rendered counts 4 and 5 moot. 12', 'Count 3 of plaintiff’s complaint, relating to the destruction of the stone wall, did not specifically mention a theory of trespass. In arguing in support of his motion for a new trial, plaintiff averred that he had previously “asked the Court for permission to amend the complaint pursuant to Rule 15(b) [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure] to remove the plaintiff’s reliance on [§ 11-41-32] and reinstate the claim on a theory of trespass * * * .” It is not apparent from the record, however, that the amendment which plaintiff initially proposed was an addition of a claim for trespass.', '- 12 - plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show an appropriate measure of damages.” She similarly rejected plaintiff’s argument that he should have been allowed to add a claim for trespass, reasoning that proof of damages was an essential element of plaintiff’s case. Thus, the trial justice concluded that judgments as a matter of law were proper in light of plaintiff’s failure to introduce any evidence of damages. Accordingly, the trial justice denied plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. An order to that effect entered on May 18, 2009. Morabit timely filed a notice of appeal.', 'Additional facts will be provided, as necessary, to discuss the issues raised on appeal.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Morabit raises several issues on appeal. He primarily contends that the trial justice erred in granting judgments as a matter of law in defendant’s favor and precluding his expert’s testimony on the subject of stone walls. Morabit additionally asserts that it was reversible error on the part of the trial justice to deny his request to depose Mr. Walker, his motion to amend his complaint to conform to the evidence, and his motion for a new trial.', 'III', 'Standards of Review', 'This Court’s “review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” Tarzia v. State, 44 A.3d 1245, 1251 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Gianquitti v. Atwood Medical Associates, Ltd., 973 A.2d 580, 590 (R.I. 2009)). Thus, we “review[] the entry of judgment as a matter of law by applying the same standard as the trial justice, ‘consider[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw[ing] from the record all reasonable inferences', '- 13 - that support the position of the nonmoving party.’” Id. at 1252 (quoting Gianquitti, 973 A.2d at 590). Pursuant to Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, a grant of a judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if “a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue * * * .” If, however, there are factual issues on which reasonable people may draw different conclusions, the trial justice must deny the motion. Tarzia, 44 A.3d at 1252. “We will overturn a trial justice’s decision to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law if we determine that the trial justice has invaded the province of the jury by weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of witnesses.” Franco v. Latina, 916 A.2d 1251, 1259 (R.I. 2007) (citing Calise v. Curtin, 900 A.2d 1164, 1168 (R.I. 2006)).', 'In addition, “[i]t is well settled that ‘[t]he determination of whether to qualify and permit an expert witness to proffer an expert opinion relative to an issue in dispute is left to the discretion of the trial justice * * *.’” Foley v. St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island, 899 A.2d 1271, 1280 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Debar v. Women and Infants Hospital, 762 A.2d 1182, 1185 (R.I. 2000)). When the trial justice has “soundly and judicially exercised [his or her discretion], in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the court and the parties,” this Court will not reverse the trial justice’s decision on appeal. Dawkins v. Siwicki, 22 A.3d 1142, 1154 (R.I. 2011) (citing Morra v. Harrop, 791 A.2d 472, 476-77 (R.I. 2002)).', '- 14 -', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Exclusion of Expert Testimony on Stone Walls', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice abused her discretion in precluding Professor Thorson from testifying based on his expertise in the field of stone wall science. According to plaintiff, Professor Thorson possessed sufficient knowledge, skill, experience, and education to give an opinion on the fate of the stone wall and on damages. The plaintiff further suggests that the trial justice’s ruling was prejudicial because her later decision to grant a judgment as a matter of law was based on plaintiff’s failure to introduce any evidence of damages.', '“The purpose of expert testimony is to aid in the search for the truth.” Morra, 791 A.2d at 477. Under Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of * * * opinion.”', 'Because novel scientific or complex technical evidence is often difficult for the factfinder to evaluate, such evidence “runs the risk of being ‘both powerful and quite misleading.’” Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 891 (R.I. 2003) (quoting DiPetrillo v. Dow Chemical Co., 729 A.2d 677, 688 (R.I. 1999)). Thus, when a party seeks to introduce novel or complex evidence, the trial justice will exercise a gatekeeping function. Blue Coast, Inc. v. Suarez Corp. Industries, 870 A.2d 997, 1006 (R.I. 2005). In performing that gatekeeping role, the trial justice holds “a preliminary evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury in order to determine whether', '- 15 - such evidence is reliable and whether the situation is one on which expert testimony is appropriate.” DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 685 (quoting State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 884 (R.I. 1996)). The trial justice’s primary function as gatekeeper is to make certain “that the proposed expert testimony, presented as a scientifically valid theory, is not mere ‘junk science.’” Owens, 838 A.2d at 891 (citing Gallucci v. Humbyrd, 709 A.2d 1059, 1064 (R.I. 1998)). The trial justice thereby ensures that the trier of fact considers “only expert testimony that is based on ostensibly reliable scientific reasoning and methodology.” Id. (citing DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 690).', 'We instructed in DiPetrillo that the trial justice should look to four nonexclusive factors to assist him or her in assessing the reliability and validity of expert testimony that involves novel or technically complex theories or procedures. DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 689. Those factors are: (1) whether the proffered knowledge has been or can be tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been the subject of peer review and publication; (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error; and (4) whether the theory or technique has gained general acceptance in the scientific community. Id. (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593-94 (1993)). Satisfaction of one or more of these factors may suffice to admit the proposed evidence and the trial justice need not afford each factor equal weight. Owens, 838 A.2d at 892 (citing DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 689). We have emphasized, however, that “when the proffered knowledge is neither novel nor highly technical, satisfaction of one or more of these factors is not a necessary condition precedent to allowing the expert to testify.” Id. “If the expert’s evidence is not novel, then the foundation need not be novel either.” DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 688 (quoting G. Michael Fenner, The Daubert Handbook: The Case, Its Essential Dilemma, and Its Progeny, 29 Creighton L. Rev. 939, 948 (1996)).', '- 16 -', 'Here, the trial justice characterized the study of historical stone walls as a “new bod[y] of science.” Accordingly, she stated that she was obligated to assess the reliability of Professor Thorson’s methodology by examining its acceptability in the scientific community and its prior testing by peers. Based on Professor Thorson’s responses during voir dire, the trial justice concluded that she was unable to determine whether the study of stone walls had acquired sufficient acceptance in the scientific community or been subject to peer review.', 'We initially pause over the trial justice’s characterization of the study of stone walls as a novel field of science.', 'Four years after we decided DiPetrillo, we again emphasized that satisfaction of DiPetrillo’s reliability test is unnecessary when the principles underlying an expert’s opinion are neither novel nor highly technical. See Owens, 838 A.2d at 892-93. In Owens, we held that an anesthesiologist’s expert opinion was not inadmissible for lack of independent medical corroboration because the opinion was based on “well-established and scientifically valid principles of physiology.” Id. at 893, 894. Indeed, we originally prophesied in DiPetrillo that trial justices would employ the four factors to assess the validity of scientific theories in cases such as “mass toxic torts, products liability, medical malpractice, environmental, criminal cases, or in the emerging fields of genetic engineering and organ harvesting, in which evidence of toxicology, epidemiology, immunology, risk analysis, or genetics to name a few may be presented.” DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 686.', 'In contrast to these twenty-first century subjects of litigation, stone walls have appeared in the laws and jurisprudence of New England since colonial times. See Allegra di Bonaventura, Beating the Bounds: Property and Perambulation in Early New England, 19 Yale J.L. & Human. 115, 129 (2007). In particular, testimony on damages for the destruction of stone walls is not a novel feature of litigation in Rhode Island courts. See Sweeney v. Brow, 40 R.I. 281, 290, 100', '- 17 - A. 593, 595 (1917) (upholding award of damages for the cost of rebuilding a stone wall where there was testimony upon which trial justice could have based award); Chapman v.

Furthermore, Professor Thorson’s stone wall theories in the instant matter appear to have their foundations in well-established principles of sedimentology, geology, hydrology, and geochemistry. Professor Thorson clarified that there is “no formalized discipline yet for stone wall science[,] but it’s * * * part of * * * historic above ground archeology and that is a legitimate science.”', 'Nonetheless, even if we accept the trial justice’s assertion that the study of stone walls is a novel science, we ultimately conclude that the trial justice erred in excluding Professor Thorson’s testimony because she applied an overly rigid standard for the admission of expert opinions. As we have previously explained, the factors mentioned in DiPetrillo were intended “to liberalize the admission of expert testimony by providing a mechanism by which parties can admit new or novel scientific theories into evidence that may have previously been deemed inadmissible.” Owens, 838 A.2d at 892 (citing 1 David L. Faigman et al., Modern Scientific Evidence, § 1-3.4 at 26 n.74 (2002)). The party seeking to admit expert testimony need only demonstrate that the expert arrived at his or her conclusions in a “scientifically sound and methodologically reliable manner.” Id.', 'We have previously found an abuse of discretion on the part of a trial justice when his or her overly stringent application of the test for admissibility of expert testimony “impermissibly conflate[s] [his or] her own functions with those of the jury.” Gallucci, 709 A.2d at 1064; see Owens, 838 A.2d at 899 (“In deciding whether to admit proffered expert testimony, the trial', '- 18 - justice must take care not to interfere with the jury’s role as the trier of fact.”). If “the evidence presented to support the expert’s proposed opinions is sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that his * * * methods are grounded in valid science, then cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the appropriate means of attacking the reliability of this evidence.” Owens, 838 A.2d at 899-900 (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596). “Thereafter, the jury [can] * * * decide[] how much weight— if any—to give [an expert’s] opinions in light of the dearth of peer-reviewed studies and published protocols to corroborate his [or her] specific theories * * *.” Id. at 900.', 'During voir dire, the trial justice questioned Professor Thorson about whether his theories on stone walls had undergone peer review. Professor Thorson replied:', '“I have not submitted a journal article for anonymous peer review', '* * * in part because there is no journal for stone wall studies. * *', '* I mean pieces of [his book] have been peer reviewed in articles', 'dealing with wetland and landscape.', '“You can also argue that the[re is] widespread acceptance', 'by my scientific peers [in that] it’s been featured at meetings[;] it’s', 'sold in agency book stores. * * * There is no peer review process', 'for books that are published in the same way that there are journal', 'articles * * * .

If you think about the narrower definition * * * that * *', '* there is no journal.” From Professor Thorson’s response, it is clear that, although his books on stone walls did not undergo a formal peer review, his peers have provided positive commentary and feedback on his work. He specifically indicated that one of his books on stone walls had received endorsements from scientific professionals, scholars, and historians. Professor Thorson further explained that, while his theories have not undergone statistical testing for error, they have been tested anecdotally.', '- 19 -', 'Professor Thorson’s credentials gave additional assurance of the reliability of his underlying methods. See In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d 674, 684 (R.I. 2005) (“The court may also consider the qualifications of the expert in determining whether the underlying methods are reliable.” (quoting Owens, 838 A.2d at 891-92)). Professor Thorson is a professor of geology at the University of Connecticut with a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Washington. He has been studying stone walls since 1984 and published three books on the subject, as well as numerous articles. Two of those books won awards in their respective genres. In addition, he has previously testified in court concerning stone walls. With such qualifications, there is no danger that Professor Thorson is a “charlatan or a purveyor of junk science.” See Gallucci, 709 A.2d at 1064.', 'There was sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable juror to find that Professor Thorson’s methods were grounded in valid and reliable science. Thus, any lack of formalism in the peer review of Professor Thorson’s theories should have been for the jury to consider in weighing his testimony.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice abused her discretion in precluding Professor Thorson’s expert testimony on the subject of historic stone walls. Since the trial justice’s denial of plaintiff’s request to amend and her grant of a judgment as a matter of law on count 3 were predicated upon plaintiff’s failure to offer proof of damages, the trial justice’s exclusion of Professor Thorson’s testimony was so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error and require a new trial on that count.', 'B', 'Judgment as a Matter of Law on Count 2', 'In ruling on defendant’s motion for a judgment as a matter of law on count 2, the trial justice found that plaintiff’s evidence of damages was insufficient to go to the jury because there', '- 20 - was no proof of the value of the trees at the time of injury. The plaintiff argues that under the proper standard for Rule 50, he was entitled to an inference that the replacement cost of the trees was based on prices in existence at the time of injury. He points out that Mr. Largess was never asked and did not testify as to the dates of the replacement costs. Thus, plaintiff argues that it was pure speculation for the trial justice to conclude that the estimate of damages was not based on data from 2001.', '“When confronted with a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the trial justice must * * * draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.” McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 285 (R.I. 2012) (citing Oliveira v. Jacobson, 846 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2004)). The trial justice is precluded from weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses. See Rule 50. We recently explained that “[t]his deference is required because of the weighty consequences attendant to granting a Rule 50 motion—it removes the case from the jury’s consideration upon a finding that the nonmoving party failed to present legally sufficient evidence to permit the trier of fact to reach a favorable verdict.” McGarry, 47 A.3d at 285 (citing Gianquitti, 973 A.2d at 590). Thus, “we will reverse a trial justice’s grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law when the trial justice has ‘invaded the province of the jury’ by impermissibly finding facts * * * or ‘by weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of witnesses[.]’” Gianquitti, 973 A.2d at 590 (quoting Hanson v. Singsen, 898 A.2d 1244, 1248 (R.I. 2006) and Franco, 916 A.2d at 1259).', 'In this case, the trial justice rested her decision to grant a judgment as a matter of law in defendant’s favor on several assumptions.', 'First, she assumed that Mr. Largess had made inquiries of nurseries sometime between 2005 and 2009, the timeframe during which Mr. Largess visited plaintiff’s property. She further assumed that, when Mr. Largess made those', '- 21 - inquiries, he did not specifically ask the nurseries to provide him with an estimate of what it would have cost for a replacement tree in 2001. Finally, the trial justice assumed that the removal of the trees occurred in 2001.', 'After reviewing the relevant evidence, we conclude that the trial justice’s assumptions were improper. While it was undisputed that Mr. Largess visited plaintiff’s property between August 2005 and January 15, 2009, Mr. Largess did not specify the dates on which he made inquiries of nurseries.', 'Nor did he indicate whether he had specifically requested that the nurseries provide him with prices from 2001. Moreover, we note that there was some variation in the testimony of the various witnesses concerning the exact dates of the injury. Morabit stated that he first noticed the destruction of his property in the “early 2000s,” while Mr. Largess placed the time of injury sometime around 2001 to 2002. Ms. Steere testified that the removal of the trees occurred between 1999 and 2003, with additional alteration of the stone wall occurring as late as 2008. Accordingly, the date of injury and the date of the estimate of damages were factual questions properly left for the jury’s resolution.', 'The trial justice also appears to have exceeded the permissible bounds of a Rule 50 motion when she assessed the credibility of Mr. Largess’s testimony on damages. She stated that, in the absence of any evidence that someone had actually counted the missing trees before their removal, Mr. Largess’s estimate of 190 trees lacked sufficient certainty. The trial justice added that “[t]he rest of the [Purdue] formula in many respects, in spite of what [Mr. Largess] says, in this Court’s opinion is based upon subjective assessment, particularly in this case where he guesstimates never having seen the trees that were missing.” She highlighted her particular concern that Mr. Largess may have overestimated plaintiff’s damages by assigning values of 100 percent for condition and location class.', '- 22 -', '“The ‘task of assessing compensatory damages is peculiarly within the province of the jury * * *.’” Castellucci v.

The failure to count the trees prior to their removal does not take Mr. Largess’s assessment outside the range of reasonable and probable estimates. Mr. Largess explained both how he arrived at his estimate of 190 missing trees and why he assigned 100 percent values for the missing tupelo trees.', 'Defense counsel then had an opportunity to point out some of the weaknesses in Mr. Largess’s estimate. The jury could have properly considered these factors in arriving at a measure of damages, if any, that would fairly compensate plaintiff for his loss. If the jury returned an award which the trial justice concluded was excessive in light of the evidence presented at trial, she could have rejected the jury’s award on a motion for a new trial or ordered a remittitur. See Reccko v. Criss Cadillac Co., 610 A.2d 542, 546 (R.I. 1992). On a Rule 50 motion, however, it was reversible error for the trial justice to invade the province of the jury by weighing Mr. Largess’s testimony and making findings of fact. Accordingly, a new trial is also necessary on count 2.', '- 23 -', 'Since there was significant debate during the proceedings below about whether the diminution in the fair market value of Morabit’s property was a more appropriate measure of damages, we take this opportunity to offer guidance on remand as to the acceptable methods of valuing trees. Section 34-20-1 entitles the landowner to damages in an amount equal to double “the value of any tree” cut, destroyed, or removed. The appropriate methods for determining the value of a tree under § 34-20-1 is an issue of first impression for this Court. 13 Fortunately, many of our sister states have spoken on this issue.', 'Our review of relevant jurisprudence suggests that the most sensible approach focuses on the use of the trees and their intrinsic value to the property. See, e.g., Evenson v. Lilley, 282 P.3d 610, 614 (Kan. 2012) (citing Mosteller v. Naiman, 7 A.3d 803 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2010)). For commercial trees whose primary value derives from their use as a commodity, the assessment of damages is relatively straightforward. For example, damages may be assessed using the fair market value of timber, lumber, or other wood products. See Bangert v. Osceola County, 456 N.W.2d 183, 190 (Iowa 1990); see also Shea v. Brando Associates, 621 A.2d 184, 185 (R.I. 1993) (mem.) (trial justice was not clearly wrong in allowing the approximate value of cord wood as the measure of damages).', 'The assessment of damages becomes more complex when the trees’ value derives not from their use as a commodity but from their unique contributions to the land or the landowner. In acknowledgement of this complexity, other courts faced with the task of determining the appropriate measure of damages for noncommercial trees have stressed the need for flexibility. See Evenson, 282 P.3d at 614; Mosteller, 7 A.3d at 808; see also Bangert, 456 N.W.2d at 189 13', 'In White v. LeClerc, 444 A.2d 847 (R.I. 1982), we expressly declined to address this question since the parties had impliedly consented to replacement value as the appropriate measure of damages. See id. at 849 n.3.', '- 24 - (“it ‘is impossible to state a simple, all-purpose measure of recovery for loss of trees’” (quoting Laube v. Estate of Thomas, 376 N.W.2d 108, 109 (Iowa 1985)); Glavin v. Eckman, 881 N.E.2d 820, 825 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008) (where fair market value was not adequate compensation for loss of trees, trial judge had “broad discretion” to allow jury to consider other evidence of damages). Accordingly, we do not consider it wise to adopt a single uniform measure of damages for § 34- 20-1. Instead, we synthesize below some of the guiding principles and relevant factors for fashioning an appropriate measure of damages for the loss of noncommercial trees and shrubs.', 'As a starting point, we note that courts have permitted landowners to recover damages in excess of the diminution in the fair market value of the property when the removed trees or shrubs had a peculiar value to the landowner or made a unique contribution to the property. See 25 C.J.S. Damages § 154 (2013) (citing Vaught v. A.O. Hardee & Sons, Inc., 623 S.E.2d 373 (S.C. 2005), and Kallis v. Sones, 146 Cal.Rptr. 3d 419 (Cal. Ct. App. 2012)). In so holding, courts have frequently cited to the Restatement (Second) Torts § 929 which provides, in relevant part:', '“(1) If one is entitled to a judgment for harm to land resulting from', 'a past invasion and not amounting to a total destruction of value,', 'the damages include compensation for', '“(a) the difference between the value of the land before the', 'harm and the value after the harm, or at his election in an', 'appropriate case, the cost of restoration that has been or may be', 'reasonably incurred[.]” Restatement (Second) Torts § 929 at 544', '(1979) (emphasis added). The comment to § 929(1)(a) explains:', '“If * * * the cost of replacing the land in its original condition is', 'disproportionate to the diminution in the value of the land caused', 'by the trespass, unless there is a reason personal to the owner for', 'restoring the original condition, damages are measured only by the', 'difference between the value of the land before and after the', 'harm.” Id. § 929, cmt. b at 545-46.', '- 25 - Thus, to determine when restoration costs in excess of the diminution of the value of the property may be appropriate, courts have focused on whether there is a “reason personal” to the landowner for restoring the trees and shrubs. See, e.g., Osborne v. Hurst, 947 P.2d 1356, 1359 (Alaska 1997); Kallis, 146 Cal.Rptr. 3d at 423; Lampi v. Speed, 261 P.3d 1000, 1005 (Mont. 2011); Morris v. Ciborowski, 311 A.2d 296, 299 (N.H. 1973); Vaught, 623 S.E.2d at 377. Whether there is a reason personal to the landowner or a peculiar value of the trees are ordinarily factual questions for the jury to resolve. Lampi, 261 P.3d at 1008; see Osborne, 947 P.2d at 1360.', 'We observe that restoration costs are most consistently allowed in cases where the parcel is of a relatively small size and the trees make a conspicuous contribution to the land, such as shade and ornamental trees on residential lots. For example, one court allowed replacement costs in excess of the diminution in value where the removed trees had shaded the plaintiffs’ entire home and provided their grandchildren with a playhouse. See Kallis, 146 Cal.Rptr. 3d at 423. Similarly, restoration costs were deemed appropriate where the destroyed trees provided privacy and a natural fence for pets, see Gross v. Jackson Township, 476 A.2d 974, 976 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1974), and where the trees had “historic” and “sentimental” value. See Bangert, 456 N.W.2d at 190; cf. Mosteller, 7 A.3d at 808-09 (reasoning that decreases in attractiveness, privacy, and shade, and increases in risks of erosion and infestation were typical consequences from loss of trees and therefore did not demonstrate peculiar value of trees). Even where the trees’ removal increased the value of the property, restoration costs were permitted when the plaintiffs had specifically planted the trees to beautify the property according to their tastes. See Threlfall v. Town of Muscoda, 527 N.W.2d 367, 371-73 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994).', '- 26 -', 'In contrast, in Morabit’s case, the missing trees were located on a relatively large tract of unimproved indigenous forestland. In such instances, courts have appeared more reluctant to allow restoration costs.', 'The Kansas Supreme Court held that replacement costs were an inappropriate measure of damages for the destruction of 200 trees on a 160 acre parcel. Evenson, 282 P.3d at 617. In that case, the plaintiffs used the land for hunting, camping, and recreation. Id. at 612. In upholding the lower court’s decision to limit the plaintiffs’ recovery to the diminution in the value of the land, the Kansas Court reasoned that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the trees were important to their hunting, picnicking, and recreational activities. See id. at 616.', 'Nonetheless, other courts have allowed replacement costs in excess of the diminution in value of the property even where the trees were indigenous species on unimproved acreage. See Heninger v. Dunn, 162 Cal.Rptr. 104, 108-09 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980); Vaught, 623 S.E.2d at 374, 378. As one court poetically but persuasively explained:', '“One person’s unsightly jungle may be another person’s enchanted', 'forest; certainly the owner of such land should be allowed to enjoy', 'it free from a trespasser’s bulldozer. Indeed, a trespasser should', 'not be allowed, with impunity, to negligently or willfully wreak', 'havoc on a landowner’s natural woods, and the landowner’s', 'attempted recovery for such injury should not be entirely frustrated', 'by the fact that the market does not reflect his personal loss.”', 'Vaught, 623 S.E.2d at 377 (quoting Keitges v. VanDermeulen, 483', 'N.W.2d 137, 143 (Neb. 1992)). In Keitges, 483 N.W.2d at 138-39, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that restoration costs were an appropriate measure of damages for the loss of approximately 100 trees on ten unimproved acres. The court rejected the defendant’s argument that it should limit a landowner’s damages in cases where the removed trees are random indigenous growth, rather than transplanted ornamental species. See id. at 143. The Nebraska Court reasoned that the plaintiff-landowner,', '- 27 - who possessed a degree in biological science, had a particular reason for restoring his land since he had testified that he used the forestland for nature walks and studies. See id.', 'As a final consideration, we express our agreement with those jurisdictions which have placed an overall limit of reasonableness on restoration costs. Even when a landowner has offered sufficient proof of a peculiar value to justify an award of restoration costs in excess of the diminution in value, that award may not be unreasonable in relation to the change in the value of the property. See, e.g., Osborne, 947 P.2d at 1360; Ritter v. Bergmann, 891 N.E.2d 248, 257 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008); Mosteller, 7 A.3d at 809. 14 The overall goal is to place the injured landowner as near as possible to his or her pre-injury position, not to grant the landowner a windfall.

We stress, however, that the trial justice’s concern to avoid granting plaintiff a windfall was both relevant and well-founded. As the trial justice pointed out on more than one occasion, neither party introduced any evidence of the diminution in the fair market value of Morabit’s property. On remand, such evidence would be relevant to assess the reasonableness of Mr. Largess’s estimate.', 'Because we conclude that the trial justice committed reversible errors necessitating a new trial on both counts, we need not address the plaintiff’s remaining allegations of error. 14', 'In addition, some courts have suggested that the fair market value of the entire parcel prior to the trees’ removal should serve as a ceiling on damages.

105,No. 2012-321-M.P. (W2/97-190A) (P2/01-99A) State : v. : Lawrence Clay. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. A young girl’s decision to leave her grandparents’ home surreptitiously in the early-morning hours in order to rendezvous with her boyfriend resulted in consequences she did not foresee: her abduction in Middletown, an automobile ride to New Bedford during which she was concealed beneath a tarpaulin, and an alleged sexual assault in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.', 'The defendant, Lawrence Clay, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction, having been found guilty by a jury of kidnapping of a minor and reckless driving, for which he was sentenced to sixty years, with thirty years to serve and thirty years suspended, with probation. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) admitting testimony about the alleged sexual assault; and (2) denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. 1 For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The defendant’s trial was held concurrently with a probation-violation hearing, at the conclusion of which the trial justice “vacated” two previously suspended sentences in their entirety. The defendant did not initially appeal from this judgment, but this Court granted his subsequent petition for writ of certiorari to review these probation-violation adjudications. The probation violation review was then consolidated with defendant’s appeal. At oral argument,', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts 2 and Procedural History', 'In the early morning of October 29, 2009, after hours of online instant-messaging, a fourteen-year-old girl whom we shall call Sally Jones (Jones) agreed to sneak out of her grandparents’ apartment in the Town of Middletown to meet her seventeen-year-old boyfriend. At approximately 2:50 a.m., after stuffing clothing underneath her sheets in an attempt to conceal her departure from her grandparents, she set off on the roughly two-mile walk to the boyfriend’s residence.', 'At trial, Jones testified that after walking a distance down West Main Road, she turned onto Forest Avenue, when a car swerved out of the Shell gas station on the corner and pulled up beside her. The driver, whom Jones would later identify as defendant, asked her where she was going. According to Jones, upon learning that she was walking to her boyfriend’s house, defendant demanded that she get in the vehicle, threatening to shoot her if she did not comply. Jones opened the door and got in the front seat. The vehicle, a dark green Nissan Maxima adorned with spray-painted orange flames, was crammed with items such as trash and garbage bags, a garden hose, various items of clothing, backpacks, gloves, and shoes. Jones testified that defendant covered her with a large, gray automobile cover and towel, spun the car around and, ignoring her repeated requests to take her home, sped north on West Main Road toward Portsmouth.', 'Jones testified that defendant engaged her in a series of personal questions, asking her name, age, and whether she and her boyfriend were sexually active together; she added that however, defendant conceded that he was waiving any allegation of error with respect to the probation-violation proceeding. 2', 'Our recitation of the facts is derived from the testimony elicited at trial, primarily the testimony of the complaining witness.', '-2- defendant became angry if she did not respond. Although still covered with the tarpaulin, Jones was occasionally able to peek out in an attempt to ascertain her surroundings, at one point identifying Portsmouth High School on her right. Jones also noticed flashing red and blue lights that defendant claimed were the police chasing them, but were later confirmed to be police cruisers monitoring an overnight construction detail on West Main Road.', 'After driving approximately fifteen minutes, defendant pulled into a Dunkin’ Donuts to order a coffee at the drive-through window, while Jones remained hidden underneath the tarpaulin in the passenger seat.', 'While at the drive-through window, defendant introduced himself to Quiana Baptiste, who was working the third shift at Dunkin’ Donuts that night. The defendant, who Baptiste testified was edgy and nervous, introduced himself as a nightclub promoter, gave her his card, and told her that “he would put [her] on the VIP list.” Although Baptiste initially declined the offer, she eventually conceded, scrawling a fake telephone number on defendant’s business card before returning it to him. Jones testified that she thought that when the woman came back with the coffee it would be a good time to uncover and ask for help, so she attempted to make what she described as a “slick movement,” only to have defendant hit her on the head, shocking her and preventing any further movement.', 'After thwarting Jones’s attempt to seek help, defendant left the Dunkin’ Donuts and proceeded to a Shell station in what Jones thought might have been Fall River. While defendant was inside the gas station, Jones managed to peek out yet again, this time seeing a cab driver filling up at a nearby pump. Although defendant was no longer in the car, Jones testified that she did not attempt to jump out and seek help because she feared that defendant had a weapon. After returning to the car, defendant continued on to his aunt’s apartment, saying he was going to use the bathroom there. Jones testified that when defendant got out of the car at his aunt’s apartment', '-3- complex, she did not attempt to run because she was unfamiliar with the area and did not know where defendant was. Jones said that when defendant exited the vehicle, she noticed that he had left his cell phone on the dashboard; however, before she had the opportunity to call for help, defendant returned to the car and angrily snatched the phone away.', 'The defendant next drove Jones to an empty football field surrounded by high grass and white construction trailers, and removed the tarpaulin and towel. Jones testified that defendant began to touch her “inappropriately.” She told the jury that despite her repeated pleas for him to stop, defendant overpowered her and removed her pajama bottoms and underwear, discarding them in the back seat. She described how defendant repositioned her so that her knees faced him, and proceeded to pull his pants down, get on top of her, and insert his penis into her vagina. Jones testified that she tried to physically resist defendant by pushing on his shoulders, but he was too strong for her.', 'Jones further testified that he refused to return her clothing and underwear, instead giving her a pair of sweatpants from his wardrobe of clothing in the backseat. The defendant then returned to the apartment complex parking lot, where he showed Jones a memorial card for his recently deceased cousin. Jones said she was crying and kept asking defendant to take her home, but that he refused because she had “disrespected his cousin * * * by crying.”', 'Jones testified that as they were sitting in the parking lot, she noticed two women exiting the apartment building with their babies. She further testified that she managed to open the door, kick free from defendant’s grasp and run toward the women; however, when she ran toward the two women, screaming that she had been kidnapped, the women ignored her, so she continued past them out to the main street. Jennifer Ferrera, a math teacher at nearby New Bedford High School, was driving to drop off lesson plans at school when she saw Jones, crying and waving', '-4- for her to stop. Ferrera testified at trial that Jones was crying hysterically, shouting that she had been kidnapped and that defendant was coming back for her, so Ferrera got out of her truck and waved to the driver behind her for help. 3 The driver, another New Bedford High School teacher, allowed the frantic Jones into the passenger side of his pickup truck and dialed 9-1-1. The police arrived shortly thereafter and took Jones to Saint Luke’s Hospital for examination and then to the New Bedford police station.', 'Jones then met with detectives from both the New Bedford and Middletown police departments, to whom she gave several conflicting accounts of what transpired between her and defendant. At trial, Jones admitted that she initially told the New Bedford police and the hospital personnel that defendant had broken into her home and abducted her at gunpoint. She also admitted to changing her story to the New Bedford police, testifying that she told them defendant had physically forced her into his car and that the Middletown Shell gas station surveillance camera would corroborate her story. Jones testified on both direct and cross-examination that the reason she lied to the police was that she did not think that anyone would help her if they had known that defendant did not physically force her into the car. In addition to the conflicting accounts of her abduction, Jones was impeached at trial with numerous other lies or misrepresentations that she told both before and during the investigation.', 'Jones told the New Bedford police that she was not sexually active with her boyfriend; however, at trial he testified to the contrary. In addition, Jones initially said that defendant had been driving 165 miles per hour, but later testified that she did not actually see how fast he was going. Jones was also impeached at trial with evidence that she had previously misrepresented her age on her MySpace account. 3', 'Jennifer Ferrera testified: “[Jones] was saying, ‘Let me in. He’s going to come back for me.’ And she did say she had been kidnapped, and she was scared[,] definitely.”', '-5-', 'On the morning of October 30, 2009, Detectives April Fernandez and Richard Gamache of the Middletown police department took Jones and her grandmother on a ride-along, in an attempt to retrace the drive and piece together Jones’s story. Detective Gamache testified at trial that the scenery along the route matched in detail Jones’s original description given to the New Bedford police, including the location of the Dunkin’ Donuts and the description of the football field. A review of that Dunkin’ Donuts surveillance tape taken on the morning of the kidnapping showed defendant buying coffee and Baptiste writing something on a business card and handing it to defendant, a scene independently corroborated at trial by both Jones and Baptiste.', 'Meanwhile, the Middletown police department put out a call to all state and nearby local police departments to be on the lookout for defendant’s green, flame-painted Nissan. Late in the evening of October 29, 2009, Newport police officer Joseph Lavallee spotted defendant’s vehicle, activated his lights, and initiated pursuit. According to Officer Lavallee, defendant proceeded to lead him on a chase through the streets of Newport, racing through stop signs at up to forty miles per hour. As he approached a red light at the intersection of Farewell Street and Van Zandt Avenue, defendant, now traveling upwards of seventy miles per hour, swerved to avoid a car turning onto Farewell Street. The defendant was unable to avoid a collision and struck the front side of the other vehicle before eventually careening to a stop some several hundred feet down the road. Officer Lavallee, as well as another officer who had arrived on the scene, ran, guns drawn, toward defendant’s badly damaged vehicle, ordered him out of the car, and placed him under arrest. Officer Lavallee testified that as defendant was being handcuffed, he began apologizing and made several unsolicited comments to the officers, stating that, “They’re trying to kill me * * * . All I did was give her a ride to Fall River.” After being advised of his constitutional rights, defendant continued to speak to the officers. According to', '-6- Officer Lavallee, “he said the Bloods were trying to kill him. He said some girl set him up, explained that she - - she approached him and said that a cop was trying to rape her so he gave her a ride to Fall River.”', 'Once defendant’s vehicle was impounded at the police station, the Middletown police, acting pursuant to a search warrant, seized numerous items from the vehicle, including: trash bags, a towel, the pajama bottoms Jones had been wearing, funeral cards written “In Loving Memory of Wayne Rice,” and a business card bearing Quiana Baptiste’s handwriting. After defendant had been remanded to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), correctional officer Steven Lombardi found a pair of red women’s underwear concealed in defendant’s boot. Although Lombardi testified that defendant claimed ownership of the underwear from his prior employment as a stripper in New Jersey, at trial Jones identified the underwear as the pair defendant had forcibly removed from her on the night of the kidnapping.', 'The defendant was subsequently tried on charges of kidnapping of a minor and reckless driving; and, on October 19, 2010, a jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial; and, on March 17, 2011, sentenced defendant to sixty years at the ACI, with thirty years to serve and thirty years suspended, with probation. In addition, the trial justice found defendant to be in violation of his probation for two previously imposed sentences and vacated the suspended sentences, imposing sentences of 114 and 142 months to run concurrently. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'We will address the issues raised on appeal seriatim.', '-7-', 'II', 'A', 'Sexual Assault Evidence', 'Prior to the commencement of trial, defendant moved in limine “to exclude any and all reference to the allegation of sexual assault.” Categorizing the sexual assault as “inextricably woven from the crime charged,” the trial justice denied the motion. There is no question that defendant appropriately preserved the issue for appellate review by objecting to the admission of such evidence at trial.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in admitting evidence of the alleged sexual assault in violation of Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because the evidence “was not reasonably necessary to present a complete story to the jury with regard to the charge of kidnapping.” Additionally, defendant urges that the evidence of the sexual assault was “irrelevant to prove any of the specified Rule 404(b) exceptions.” Finally, defendant asserts that the testimony regarding the sexual assault was “unrelated and irrelevant to the charge for which [he] was being tried,” and, limiting instructions notwithstanding, was “extremely prejudicial” and should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'The state argues, on the other hand, that admission of evidence regarding the sexual assault was proper Rule 404(b) evidence, insofar as the assault was probative of defendant’s motivation and intent to get Jones into his vehicle. The state further contends that the sexual assault was so inextricably intertwined with the kidnapping that it “was necessary to provide the jury with a complete tapestry of events as they unfolded on the night of the crime.” Lastly, the state argues that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion under Rule 403 when she admitted', '-8- the evidence of the sexual assault with an instruction to the jury limiting “consideration of the evidence to defendant’s motive, intent or plan.”', '1. Standard of Review', 'In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, it is well settled that “[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.” State v. Rios, 996 A.2d 635, 638 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 411 (R.I. 2008)).', '2. Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 403', 'In determining whether the trial justice abused her discretion in admitting evidence of the sexual assault, we must first examine the scope of admissible evidence under Rule 404(b). Rule 404(b) states that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.” Rule 404(b) thereby acts to exclude evidence of a defendant’s “crimes, wrongs, or acts * * * to prove that the accused has a criminal disposition and, therefore, is more likely to have committed the crime for which he [or she] stands accused * * * .” State v. Martinez, 59 A.3d 73, 85 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 151 (R.I. 2010)). However, Rule 404(b) does allow admission of crimes, wrongs, or acts when offered “for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, [or] plan * * * .” Additionally, Rule 404(b) “does not require exclusion of otherwise legally probative evidence simply because such evidence might also suggest past criminal activity.” Martinez, 59 A.3d at 85 (quoting State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1051 (R.I. 2000)).', 'This Court has also held that evidence of prior crimes or bad acts is admissible “if such evidence has independent relevance in respect to the proof of an element material to the chain of proof of the crime in issue,” id., (quoting Garcia, 743 A.2d at 1052), or', '-9- when “prior acts ‘are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.’” Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150-51 (quoting State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008)). In reviewing a trial justice’s admission of Rule 404(b) evidence, this Court is “disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * * .” State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1211 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Moreno, 996 A.2d 673, 678 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Evidence that may otherwise be admissible under Rule 404(b) is still subject to the Rule 403 balancing test, which excludes otherwise relevant evidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury * * * .” Therefore, Rule 403 “is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence,” State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009)), and “the trial justice must carefully weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice.” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 148 (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 n.14 (R.I. 2005)).', '3. Discussion', 'The defendant first argues that the trial justice erred in admitting evidence of the sexual assault because it was not inextricably woven with the kidnapping charge, and thus was not necessary to provide a complete picture of the issues for the jury. The defendant contends that the omission of the sexual assault from evidence would not have led to any “chronological void” in the narrative of events; rather its admission only served to complicate the single issue before the jury. The defendant posits that the evidence concerning the sexual assault was propensity evidence, offered solely to portray defendant as “a child rapist who kidnaps his victim.” In', '- 10 - support of this proposition, defendant cites to Pona, 948 A.2d at 951, in which this Court reversed the defendant’s murder conviction, based upon, inter alia, the erroneous admission of Rule 404(b) evidence. 4', 'The state argues that the evidence of the sexual assault was probative of defendant’s “motive and intent in forcing [Jones] by threat of violence and driving her, shrouded in a tarpaulin, to New Bedford.” Additionally, the state, also citing Pona, argues that the sexual- assault evidence provided a “complete and coherent narrative” of the events that transpired from the time defendant forced the victim into his car in Middletown to her eventual escape hours later in New Bedford.', 'In our opinion, the sexual assault evidence in this case—which differs markedly from the erroneously admitted Rule 404(b) evidence in Pona—was inextricably woven with the kidnapping charge and was properly admitted by the trial justice. Unlike the testimony in Pona, which concerned the defendant’s involvement with a prior murder and had little relation to the charge at hand, the sexual assault in this case took place during the course of the kidnapping for which defendant was charged. See Pona, 948 A.2d at 945. After a thorough review of the record, we are of the opinion that the evidence presented at trial concerned one continuous event that was indeed necessary in order for the jury to hear a complete and coherent rendition of what transpired in the early morning hours of October 29, 2009. But for the fact that defendant 4', 'In State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 942 (R.I. 2008), the defendant was charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the death of Jennifer Rivera, an eighth-grade girl who had been slated to testify against the defendant at his coming trial for the murder of Hector Feliciano. The night before she was to testify against the defendant, she was shot execution-style in the back of the head. Id. At the defendant’s trial for Rivera’s murder, the trial justice admitted testimony from a detective stating that he found the defendant’s pager and fingerprints at the scene of the Feliciano murder. Id. at 950. This Court held that the evidence was too tenuous to prove the defendant’s motive to kill Rivera, and its admission under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence served only to “highlight the propensity of Pona as a person who had murdered before and who would not hesitate to murder again.” Id. at 949.', '- 11 - crossed the state line, the sexual assault would likely have been tried together with the kidnapping charge.', 'The complaining witness testified to the entire sequence of events, from the time she arranged to sneak out to meet her boyfriend and her abduction in Middletown, until her eventual escape in New Bedford some hours later. In admitting the sexual-assault evidence over defense counsel’s objection, the trial justice categorized the assault as “an event that is inextricably woven from the crime charged” and found it “completely illogical under the allegations to extrude and excise that event from the State’s primary case regarding kidnapping.” We agree and are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in admitting evidence of the sexual assault under Rule 404(b).', 'Although we have determined that evidence pertaining to the alleged sexual assault was properly admissible for the reasons articulated by the trial justice, we address briefly defendant’s contention that such evidence should have been excluded because it was not relevant to establishing any of the “other purposes” specifically listed in Rule 404(b). On two occasions the trial justice gave a limiting instruction concerning evidence of a sexual assault, admonishing the jury that it could consider such evidence only as evidence of “motive, intent or plan of the crime in controversy.” 5 5', 'Prior to the presentation of any evidence in the case, the trial justice issued the following instruction:', '“[Trial Justice]: * * * Mr. Clay is not on trial here for sexual', 'assault; he is on trial here for the charge of kidnapping and reckless', 'driving. If and when evidence * * * comes in of a sexual assault,', 'you cannot receive that evidence as a juror to show or to infer that', 'Mr. Clay is of bad character, that he must have done this crime', 'because he did that crime, it’s just not before you. When and if', 'evidence of a sexual assault comes in, the only limited way in', 'which you can receive and consider that particular evidence in the', '- 12 -', 'Although “[c]onviction of crime never requires proof of motive,” State v. Caruolo, 524 A.2d 575, 584 (R.I. 1987), “motive is an item of circumstantial evidence that the jury may weigh in light of other facts and circumstances in evidence.” Id. Here, the evidence of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the same sequence of events that began when the fourteen-year-old complaining witness entered defendant’s vehicle in Middletown is, we believe, highly probative of defendant’s motive for kidnapping her in the first place. As defendant argues, however, evidence of motive may be relevant and thus admissible, “provided it does not cause the jury to speculate or focus on collateral matters.” Id. We now turn, therefore, to the question of whether the evidence of the sexual assault should have been excluded because it was unfairly prejudicial.', 'The defendant argues that, irrespective of its admissibility under Rule 404(b), given the graphic nature of Jones’s testimony concerning the sexual assault, the probative value of such evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and should have been excluded under Rule 403.', 'The defendant also argues that the evidence should have been excluded because of the likelihood of the jury confusing the uncharged sexual assault with the kidnapping for which he was on trial. In addressing these arguments, we begin by noting the well-settled principle that “[i]t is within the sound discretion of the trial justice whether to admit', 'context of this trial is as some evidence of the accused’s motive,', 'intent, or plan * * * .” After the state’s direct examination of Jones, the trial justice issued another limiting instruction regarding the assault:', '“[Trial Justice]: * * * Ladies and gentlemen, before we resume', 'with the testimony, I am obligated to repeat to you that any', 'testimony which is furnished to you, presented to you on the issue', 'of sexual assault has absolutely no bearing on the crime of', 'kidnapping, which is the offense under your consideration. It can', 'be considered only if you choose to consider it as evidence of', 'motive, intent or plan of the crime in controversy. I repeat to you', 'that it cannot be regarded by you to show evidence of bad', 'character by Mr. Clay or of evidence that any crime was', 'committed.”', '- 13 - or exclude evidence under Rule 403.” Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 997 (quoting John, 881 A.2d at 927). This Court “will not disturb such a determination on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Id.', 'Here, the record demonstrates that the decision to admit the evidence of the sexual assault in its entirety was not made without careful thought and deliberation on the part of the trial justice. At trial, defense counsel objected to the proposed introduction of the evidence, arguing that it was extremely prejudicial to force him to try a kidnapping case while “defending a rape case at the same time.” In overruling the objection, the trial justice explained that while she “appreciate[s] the uncharged crime * * * the whole thing just is completely illogical under the allegations to extrude and excise that event from the State’s primary case regarding kidnapping.” The trial justice cited hearing testimony from a Det. Swierk concerning several statements made by defendant that the sex was consensual, including a reference that Jones had initiated it, and also that Jones was looking for defendant to rescue her. 6 The trial justice stated that, in light of the allegations, “the [c]ourt is constrained to find the logical and fair way to extrude those allegations from the alleged factual scenario here * * * .”', 'It is clear to us that the trial justice considered the potential effects of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues and acted accordingly, issuing limiting instructions to the jury on two occasions during the trial; defendant did not object to either instruction and declined the trial justice’s offer of a third limiting instruction.7 Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice 6', 'As noted supra, Officer Lavallee testified that defendant had claimed that Jones had initially approached him, saying that a “cop” had been trying to rape her. 7', 'After both parties had rested, the following exchange occurred between the trial justice and defense counsel:', '“[Trial Justice]: * * * [Counsel], I neglected to ask you', 'when we were discussing instructions in chambers, do you want', 'another repetition of the assault? How – or do you just want that', '- 14 - did not abuse her discretion in admitting the evidence of the sexual assault, and we discern no grounds for vacating the judgment in this regard.', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice, in denying his motion for a new trial, misconceived and overlooked critical evidence when she failed to consider the inconsistencies and lies in the complaining witness’s testimony. The defendant accurately points out many of the inconsistencies in Jones’s differing versions of the events that she narrated throughout the course of the investigation, and he argues that she “was no doubt lying yet again about why she entered [defendant’s] car * * * .” Secondly, defendant argues that the fact that Jones wept throughout her direct examination, only to have her “tears dried up” on cross-examination, was indicative of her penchant to lie for her own benefit, a fact overlooked by the trial justice in denying the motion. Finally, defendant argues that, despite a number of statements made to police that were arguably against his interest, “never once did he admit that he kidnapped this young woman,” a fact presumably evincing his innocence.', 'left alone, you know, say in argument that’s not what we’re here', 'for?', '“[Counsel]: You’ve instructed them enough, and I’m okay', 'with that.

106,State : v. : Harold T. Drew.,criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Harold T. Drew, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on one count of first-degree murder, one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and three counts of entering a dwelling with the intent to commit a larceny therein. This Court affirmed the defendant’s conviction on appeal, State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397 (R.I. 2007), and he then filed the instant motion for a new trial. 1 The defendant now argues that a recently discovered police narrative discloses new, material evidence concerning a cooperation agreement between the Swansea (Massachusetts) Police Department, the Rhode Island State Police, and a prominent state’s witness in the defendant’s murder trial, Bobbie-Jo Dumont. 2 The defendant also claims that the prosecution violated the defendant’s constitutional due-process rights by failing to disclose the full extent of the cooperation agreement. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal 1', 'This is defendant’s second motion for a new trial. His first motion was made on November 18, 2004, and denied on December 1, 2004. 2', 'The spelling of Dumont’s first name is not consistent throughout the record. It appears in various documents as “Bobbie Jo,” “Bobbie Joe,” “Bobbie-Jo,” and “Bobbi-Jo.” We shall refer to her as Bobbie-Jo.', '-1- should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This Court is familiar with the underlying facts of this case from defendant’s first appeal, State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397 (R.I. 2007), in which his conviction was affirmed. Three people were primarily involved in the events leading to defendant’s arrest: Bobbie-Jo Dumont, Harold Andrews, 3 and defendant. Dumont and Andrews became acquainted in 2000 at a Providence strip club, where Dumont was employed as a stripper and Andrews was a customer. Id. at 400. Their relationship soon changed from a casual acquaintanceship to one in which Dumont relied on Andrews for money to support her drug addiction and to pay her bills, in exchange for which she obliged his sexual demands. Id. at 400-01.', 'Dumont met defendant in the fall of 2002, after she was admitted to a detoxification facility in North Kingstown. Drew, 919 A.2d at 401. The defendant and Dumont developed a romantic relationship, and both were prematurely expelled from the detoxification program after they were discovered having sexual relations on the premises. Id. The defendant and Dumont then continued to stay together in abandoned buildings and cars, while Andrews provided support for Dumont until Andrews became unemployed in October 2002. Id.', 'Dumont testified at defendant’s trial that she, defendant, and Andrews perpetrated a string of breaking-and-entering crimes between November 2002 and June 2003, usually with 3', 'Andrews is sometimes referred to as “Jack” in the record.', '-2- Andrews providing transportation while Dumont and defendant entered the residences. 4 On or around May 12, 2003, however, Andrews told Dumont that he no longer wished to participate in the break-ins, and the two engaged in a physical altercation. Dumont testified that, on the day after this altercation, she and defendant asked Andrews to drive them to a remote field in the Town of Exeter, where the three had previously stashed a gun locker, and Andrews agreed. Dumont further testified that, while she and Andrews were attempting to wipe fingerprints off the gun locker, she saw defendant shoot and kill Andrews.', 'The defendant and Dumont were arrested for Andrews’s murder on June 6, 2003. Drew, 919 A.2d at 402. On July 31, 2003, Dumont entered into a cooperation agreement with the state, in which she agreed to plead to one charge of possession of heroin and two counts of breaking and entering committed within the state of Rhode Island. The agreement provided for Dumont to receive sentences of three years suspended/three years probation for the heroin possession charge and five years suspended/five years probation for the breaking-and-entering charges. The state also agreed to withdraw a pending bail-violation notice that had been filed pursuant to Rule 46(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in an unrelated matter. The agreement was executed in exchange for Dumont’s past and future cooperation and testimony in connection with the prosecution of all criminal cases brought as a result of Andrews’s murder.', 'It is undisputed that the state provided defendant with the following documents prior to trial: Dumont’s cooperation agreement, Dumont’s witness statements, and a narrative written by 4', 'The exact number of breaking and enterings is not clear. On direct examination at trial, Dumont testified that she, defendant, and Andrews broke into houses “just about every day” between November 2002 and June 2003. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dumont if she had committed “around 18 breaking and enterings,” and she answered affirmatively. According to a narrative written by Det. Gregory T. Ryan of the Swansea Police Department, Dumont said “she had committed approximately 80 house breaks and larcenies.” Dumont’s witness statement from August 7, 2003, lists seventeen specific addresses that she identified as part of the break-ins in which she participated.', '-3- Det. Arthur J. Kershaw of the Rhode Island State Police that described Dumont’s cooperation with the state.', 'The defendant’s trial began in October 2004, and included three days of testimony from Dumont. Detective Kershaw also testified, stating that he investigated a number of “B & E’s” in the “South County” area in May 2003, and that he was thereafter assigned to the homicide investigation concerning Andrews’s death in June 2003. On cross-examination, Det. Kershaw testified that he was aware that Dumont was involved in numerous breaking and enterings in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and that she had agreed to cooperate with detectives in both jurisdictions. On November 10, 2004, defendant was convicted on one count of first-degree murder, one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and three counts of entering a dwelling with the intent to commit a larceny therein. Drew, 919 A.2d at 402- 03. Judgment of conviction was entered in the Superior Court on February 7, 2005. The defendant filed a timely appeal on the grounds of evidentiary errors, erroneous jury instructions, and a Confrontation Clause violation; his conviction was affirmed by this Court on May 16, 2007.', 'On January 2, 2008, defendant filed the underlying motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, in which he asserted that, after his conviction in Rhode Island he was taken to Massachusetts to face additional breaking-and- entering charges.', 'The defendant claimed that, during the course of the Massachusetts proceeding, he “discovered details of a cooperation agreement between the State’s main witness, Bobbi Jo Dumont, and Massachusetts authorities.”', 'Specifically, defendant referred to a Supplemental Narrative of Det. Gregory T. Ryan of the Swansea Police Department, dated May', '-4- 17, 2004. 5 Detective Ryan’s narrative reveals that he, Dumont, and Det. Kershaw traveled to the locations of four reported “house breaks” in Swansea, Massachusetts, with Dumont identifying the homes as being those where she, defendant, and Andrews had committed break-ins. 6 The final paragraph of Det. Ryan’s narrative states that “[a]s requested by Det. Arthur Kershaw, as part of her cooperation, Bobbie Jo Dumont will not be charged due to her assistance as a witness.” The state asserted that it was not made aware of Det. Ryan’s narrative until after the close of defendant’s trial, and defendant did not present evidence to challenge this assertion.', 'The defendant argued that Det. Ryan’s narrative evidenced a cooperation agreement that should have been disclosed to defendant prior to trial and that this lack of disclosure prevented defendant from fully presenting his best defense in contravention of his due-process rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). 7 The state filed an objection to defendant’s motion on June 1, 2011, arguing that Det. Ryan’s narrative did not reveal newly discovered evidence. 8 The trial justice conducted an evidentiary hearing on June 1, 2011, with testimony from Dumont, Det. Ryan, and Det. Kershaw. After the hearing, the parties filed additional memoranda, and, on March 23, 2012, the trial court entered an order denying defendant’s motion, accompanied by a seventeen-page decision dated March 8, 2012. The trial justice found no due-process violation and no reason for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, reasoning that Det. Ryan’s narrative did not 5', 'Although Det. Ryan’s narrative is dated “05/17/2004,” it references break-ins that occurred during the spring of 2003. The narrative states that Dumont recounted these break-ins for Det. Ryan and Det. Kershaw in August 2003, but conflictingly uses the date “Aug 8, 2004” as well. 6', 'Detective Ryan’s narrative also mentions one house identified in Somerset, Massachusetts, but does not provide specific information as to Dumont’s involvement with that location. 7', 'The defendant also argued that Dumont committed perjury by testifying that Det. Kershaw did not make any promises to her and that the state failed to disclose additional promises to not charge Dumont with murder or conspiracy to murder. These arguments are not presented on appeal. 8', 'It is unclear from the record why more than three years passed between defendant’s motion and the state’s objection. The state’s objection was filed in open court, on the same date as the motion hearing.', '-5- present new evidence and that the evidence was merely cumulative and impeachment evidence. 9 The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a trial court’s decision denying a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, this Court “will not overturn the trial justice’s decision absent an indication that ‘he or she overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” State v. Price, 66 A.3d 406, 418 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 464 (R.I. 2002)). In contrast, “[t]his Court will ‘apply a de novo standard of review * * * to mixed questions of fact and law that purportedly implicate a constitutional right.’” Richards v. Fiore, 57 A.3d 254, 257 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Wiggins, 919 A.2d 987, 989 (R.I. 2007)). “Nevertheless, when we are called upon to conduct such a ‘de novo review with respect to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord great deference to a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact and to inferences drawn from those facts * * *.’” DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 942 n.18 (R.I. 2010)). Accordingly, we will review the trial justice’s Rule 33 decision for clear error, and we will review de novo the constitutional question of whether defendant’s due-process rights were violated by the state’s alleged failure to disclose the full extent of Dumont’s cooperation agreement. 9', 'The trial court also found that Dumont did not commit perjury and that the state did not consider or file charges against Dumont for murder or conspiracy to murder. As previously mentioned, these findings are not challenged on appeal.', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that he did not receive any information, before or during his trial, regarding an agreement to not charge Dumont with the Massachusetts breaking and enterings. The defendant asserts that the state’s failure to disclose this important information deprived him of the benefit of knowing the full extent of Dumont’s cooperation agreement. The defendant also argues that, under the dictates of Brady, the prosecution had a duty to disclose the information contained in Det. Ryan’s narrative regarding Det. Kershaw’s request to not charge Dumont with the Massachusetts offenses.', 'The defendant first argues that this alleged nondisclosure was deliberate, as evidenced by the fact that Det. Kershaw was the lead detective on defendant’s case and sat at counsel table throughout defendant’s trial.', 'Alternatively, defendant argues that, even if the nondisclosure was not deliberate, a new trial is required because the undisclosed evidence was material.', 'Specifically, defendant explains that the evidence was material because the state’s case was highly dependent on Dumont’s testimony, and knowing the full extent of her agreement with the state was essential to attacking her credibility.', 'The state responds by arguing that defendant’s motion was properly denied because the evidence at issue fails the two-part test established by this Court for deciding new-trial motions based on newly discovered evidence. See Price, 66 A.3d at 417, discussed infra. First, the state argues that the evidence was not newly discovered because Dumont’s cooperation agreement referred to “numerous” break-ins, and both Det. Kershaw’s narrative and Dumont’s witness statement mentioned that Dumont was involved in break-ins in Massachusetts. Further, the state argues that defense counsel demonstrated knowledge of the alleged new evidence by referring to', '-7- the Massachusetts break-ins, as well as the fact that Dumont had not been charged, during the cross-examinations of Dumont and Det. Kershaw at defendant’s trial. Next, the state argues that the alleged new evidence was merely cumulative and impeaching rather than material, because the state disclosed the terms of Dumont’s written cooperation agreement and the extent of Dumont’s criminal activity was fully explored before the jury. Finally, the state argues that the alleged new evidence was not the kind that would likely change the verdict at a new trial because evidence demeaning Dumont’s credibility, such as her significant drug use and criminal activity, was already presented at trial. As to the alleged Brady violation, the state asserts that Det. Ryan’s narrative did not disclose any facts not previously known to defendant, as evidenced by defendant’s trial strategy and the information contained in Det. Kershaw’s narrative.', 'A', 'The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Based on Newly Discovered Evidence', 'Trial courts use a two-pronged test when considering a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence brought pursuant to Rule 33. See Price, 66 A.3d at 417.', '“The first prong encompasses a four-part inquiry, requiring that the', 'evidence is (1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable', 'prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely', 'cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon', 'which it is admissible, (4) of the type which would probably', 'change the verdict at trial.” Id. (quoting State v. Woods, 936 A.2d', '195, 197 (R.I. 2007)). “The second prong, which is to be addressed only if the requirements set forth in the first prong have been satisfied, requires that the trial justice ‘determine if the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant a new trial.’” Id. (quoting Woods, 936 A.2d at 197).', 'Here, the trial justice first clarified that the evidence at issue was not Det. Ryan’s narrative itself; rather it was “only the possibility that the report contain[ed] evidence of an', '-8- undisclosed agreement that may [have] amount[ed] to evidence of a non-disclosure in violation of due process.” The court did not find evidence to suggest that defendant was anything but diligent in his pretrial efforts to discover information. Next, the court found that defendant was aware, prior to his trial, that Dumont had been involved in break-ins in Massachusetts and that she was not charged in return for her cooperation. Specifically, the trial justice pointed to Det. Kershaw’s narrative, which stated that, as part of her cooperation agreement, Dumont “agreed to identify ‘numerous residences’ in which she was involved in break-ins” and that she did in fact identify residences “throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts.” The trial justice also found that in Dumont’s witness statement dated June 6, 2003, she identified seventeen such addresses, some of which were located in Massachusetts. 10 Further, the court found that defense counsel questioned Dumont about these break-ins during cross-examination at trial, in relation to her cooperation agreement. The court also found that defense counsel questioned Det. Kershaw about the cooperation agreement as referenced in his narrative, including Det. Kershaw’s understanding that the agreement covered break-ins in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.', 'Next, the trial justice found that, even if more information could have been provided regarding Dumont’s cooperation agreement as it related to the Massachusetts crimes, the evidence would have been merely cumulative and impeaching rather than material and would probably not have changed the verdict at trial. The court found that, “given the amount of impeachment evidence presented to the jury at trial regarding Ms. Dumont’s criminal past, it would have been difficult to show that more information regarding her past would shake any confidence in the verdict.”', 'Thus, the trial court found that the alleged newly discovered evidence failed the first prong of the test to be applied for Rule 33 motions based on newly 10', 'The trial justice’s decision referred to Dumont’s statement dated June 6, 2003, but the August 7, 2003, statement was actually the one that contained the addresses of the various residences.', '-9- discovered evidence. 11 There is no indication that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence while conducting this analysis; we therefore affirm the court’s decision in this regard.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Due-Process Claim', 'In order to comply with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the state must “provide a criminal defendant with certain information.” State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008) (citing Brady, 373 U.S. at 87). “[I]f a prosecutor has suppressed evidence that would be favorable to the accused and the evidence is material to guilt or punishment, the defendant’s due-process rights have been violated and a new trial must be granted.” Id. at 229- 30. Here, the parties disagree on the threshold issue of whether the state failed to disclose information regarding an agreement not to charge Dumont with the Massachusetts break-ins. The defendant claims that “[n]o information regarding an agreement not to charge Ms. Dumont with the Massachusetts B & E’s was ever provided to [defendant] at any point before or during his trial.” Contrary to defendant’s assertion, however, the state provided defendant with several documents implying that Dumont had participated in, but had not been charged with, the Massachusetts break-ins. First, defendant received Det. Kershaw’s narrative, which stated:', '“As part of a cooperational [sic] agreement with Attorney Generals', '[sic] Department, Bobbie Joe Dumont agreed to identify numerous', 'residences in which she, Harold Drew and Harold Andrews had', 'broken into throughout the year of 2003. Per the agreement,', 'Bobbie Joe Dumont will not be prosecuted for her involvement', 'with the breaks in return for her assistance with the homicide and', 'breaks. At this time, [Rhode Island State Police] detectives', 'travelled throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts where', 'numerous residences were identified by Miss Dumont * * *.” 11', 'Because the evidence failed the first prong of the two-part test, the court did not address the second prong.', '- 10 - Second, defendant received Dumont’s witness statement dated August 7, 2003, in which she identified, as part of her cooperation agreement, seventeen residences that she had broken into. The list of identifications included four residences in Swansea, Massachusetts. Third, defendant received the written cooperation agreement between Dumont and the state of Rhode Island, in which Dumont agreed to plead to one charge of possession of heroin and two counts of breaking and entering in exchange for her “past cooperation and continued full cooperation and truthful testimony * * * in connection with the prosecution of all criminals [sic] cases brought as a result of a murder of Harold Andrews * * * and numerous breaking crimes committed by Harold Drew * * *.”', 'Additionally, defendant’s trial strategy suggests that he believed Dumont was not charged with the Massachusetts crimes in exchange for her cooperation with the state of Rhode Island. The following line of questioning occurred during defense counsel’s cross-examination of Dumont, regarding the break-ins that she identified for the Rhode Island State Police:', '“Q', 'And you told investigators at the [Adult Correctional', 'Institutions], including the Rhode Island State Police who', 'were with you, that you did about 18 -- around 18 breaking', 'and enterings, right?', '“A', 'I don’t remember if I said that.', '“Q', 'You pointed out a lot to them?', '“A', 'Pointed out a lot to them.', '“Q', 'Did you count them?', '“A', 'I didn’t count them, no.', '“Q', '18 sound good to you?', '“A', 'What do you mean sounds good?', '“Q', 'Sound too high or too low?', '“A', 'As many as I pointed out, maybe.', '“Q', 'If I told you, going through your transcript in 2003, that', 'there are 18 different locations that you brought the Rhode', 'Island State Police to, would that be accurate?', '“A', 'Okay.', '“Q', 'Okay.

So, as part of her deal with the Attorney General’s', 'Office, she agreed to cooperate with detectives in those', 'jurisdictions, correct?', '“A', 'Correct.”', 'The evidence at issue in this appeal is contained in one sentence of Det. Ryan’s newly discovered narrative: “As requested by Det. Arthur Kershaw, as part of her cooperation, Bobbie Jo Dumont will not be charged due to her assistance as a witness.” This statement does not reflect any sort of formal agreement; rather, it illustrates a mere conversation between two detectives. 12 During the defendant’s motion hearing, Det. Kershaw testified that he recalled telling Det. Ryan to “hold off” on charging Dumont with the Massachusetts breaking and enterings.', 'He then stated that he recalled telling Det. Ryan about the agreement between Dumont and the state of Rhode Island and that he may have asked Det. Ryan “not to charge her at that time.” Detective Ryan testified that he did not have any direct contact with Dumont, did not directly promise her anything, and did not make any formal agreements with her. When 12', 'It is important to note that no evidence has been presented to suggest that Dumont executed a formal, written cooperation agreement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.', '- 12 - viewed in context with the other information the defendant was given prior to trial, it is clear that Det. Ryan’s narrative revealed nothing that the defendant did not already know: Pursuant to her cooperation agreement with the state of Rhode Island, Dumont helped police identify the sites of four burglaries in Swansea, Massachusetts, and Dumont had not been charged with these burglaries at the time of the defendant’s trial. Accordingly, we hold that the defendant’s due- process rights were not violated because the state did not fail to disclose information regarding Dumont’s cooperation agreement.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

When asked whether he had read the transcript that was entered as a joint exhibit, plaintiff stated, “many times.” The plaintiff’s attorney then asked whether plaintiff understood the terms of the agreement and if he “agreed it will become a binding agreement between you and your wife,” to which he answered, “yes, I do.” On cross-examination, defendant similarly stated that the terms of the agreement had been fully explained to her and that she agreed with those terms.', 'Having the benefit of the parties’ testimony, the Family Court justice determined that the parties had settled all outstanding issues between them by means of the agreement that had been read into the record by plaintiff’s counsel at the November 12, 2002 hearing.

The plaintiff, Cynthia Caluori, appeals from a Superior Court judgment, after a bench trial, in favor of the defendant, Dexter Credit Union (Dexter), denying her claim for an easement over the defendant’s property. Mrs. Caluori had sought a declaratory judgment that an easement by prescription and an easement by implication existed that gave her the right to use a paved driveway (the disputed property) on Dexter’s property. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court justice erred in finding that she had acknowledged the defendant’s superior title and that she had not occupied the disputed property with hostility and under a claim of right. Further, the plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in finding that Mrs. Caluori had used the disputed property openly but not notoriously. Finally, the plaintiff asserts that the trial justice erred in finding that she did not establish an easement by implication.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After', '-1- considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate in part and affirm in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', ""In 1981, Mrs. Caluori and her late husband, Anthony, purchased from Dorothy Feeney a parcel of real estate located at the corner of West Greenville Road and Danielson Pike in the Town of Scituate, designated as Assessor’s Plat No. 16, lot 18 (Lot 18). At the time of the sale, Mrs. Feeney also owned an adjacent lot (Lot 19) that borders Lot 18 to the north and east, with the bulk of the parcel being located to the east of Lot 18. When Mrs. Feeney conveyed the parcel to the Caluoris, she specifically excluded a portion of Lot 18 (as it then existed) measuring approximately 21'x70'x18'x70' containing the paved driveway, which then became part of Lot 19."", 'Since at least 1971, Lot 19 has been the site of a bank. Mrs. Feeney leased the property, in succession, to Industrial National Bank, Fleet Bank, and Bank of America. 1 The disputed property is adjacent to the northern boundary of Lot 18 and provides access to Lot 19 from West Greenville Road. The plaintiff’s deed to Lot 18 states that “[t]his conveyance is made subject to that certain lease between Dorothy S. Feeney, lessor, and Industrial National Bank of Rhode 1', 'Through this property one may glimpse an era in Rhode Island’s banking history. Industrial National Bank was created by merger in the early 1950s, yet operated under a state charter dating to 1791. In 1982, Industrial National Bank changed its name to Fleet Financial Group and, in 2004 Fleet merged with Bank of America.

The plaintiff and her husband moved into one apartment and rented the second apartment to tenants. In 1983, Anthony Caluori moved a remodeled garage onto Lot 18, north of the apartment house, for use as a two-unit commercial building. The plaintiff leased this building to a variety of commercial enterprises; since 1998 it has been used by her son, Christopher Caluori, as an office for his insurance agency. The plaintiff testified that tenants of the apartment building have used the driveway on the disputed property since 1981 and that employees and customers of the commercial tenants have used the driveway since 1983. Because the commercial building is located within only eighteen feet of the northernmost border of Lot 18, the disputed property provides room for a turning radius for cars parked alongside the commercial building to access West Greenville Road.', 'On November 24, 2010, Dexter purchased Lot 19.', 'Dexter applied to the Scituate Planning Board (board) for approval of a plan to demolish the existing bank building on Lot 19 and to build a new building on the site to house a credit union branch. The plan entailed moving the driveway on the disputed property north, and installing landscaping that blocks the entrance to the driveway. 2 On September 20, 2011, the board approved Dexter’s plan over plaintiff’s objection. Mrs. Caluori did not appeal the board’s decision, however. Instead, she filed a verified complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that she possesses a prescriptive easement and 2', 'According to Dexter, the property was developed in accordance with the approved plans and construction on Lot 19 is now complete.', '-3- an easement by implication over the disputed property; she also sought an injunction that would enjoin Dexter from terminating her access to the driveway.', 'On October 31, 2011, Dexter filed a counterclaim alleging trespass and seeking to quiet title. On December 19, 2011, plaintiff amended her complaint to add three additional counts related to cesspools on Lot 19 that are connected to Lot 18. On January 17, 2012, the parties filed a stipulation dismissing with prejudice plaintiff’s three counts related to cesspools as well as defendant’s counterclaims for trespass and quiet title.', 'A three-day bench trial was held, commencing on March 5, 2012. On April 11, 2012, the trial justice issued a written decision denying plaintiff’s claims for an easement by prescription and easement by implication, thus denying her request for a permanent injunction.

The plaintiff also asserts that the trial justice relied on a notice of intent to dispute (notice) that was not in evidence. Further, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in finding that Mrs. Caluori used the disputed property openly but not notoriously. Finally, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erroneously applied the standard for an easement by necessity to the claim of easement by implication.', 'The defendant argues that plaintiff failed to offer clear and convincing evidence that a prescriptive easement exists. The defendant asserts that the trial justice correctly applied the standard for an implied easement and that because the driveway was not “reasonably necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the property as it existed when the severance was made,” her denial of plaintiff’s claim of easement by implication was correct.

However, the trial justice found that plaintiff had not established that she used the disputed property in the requisite notorious or hostile manner under a claim of right. We shall address these elements separately.', '1', 'Hostile Use and Claim of Right', ""Requiring a claim of right “is the same as requiring hostility, in that both terms simply indicate that the claimant is holding the property with an intent that is adverse to the interests of the true owner.” DiPippo v. Sperling, 63 A.3d 503, 508 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003)). “For use of another's land to qualify as hostile, ‘[i]t is sufficient if one goes upon the land openly and uses it adversely to the true owner * * * .’” Butterfly Realty, 45 A.3d at 589 (quoting Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 831 (R.I. 2001)). This use has been characterized as such usage “as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].” Tavares, 814 A.2d at 351 (quoting 16 Powell on Real Property, § 91.05[1] at 91-23 (2000))."", 'Recently, this Court held that “the objective manifestations that another has superior title, made after the statutory period and not made to settle an ongoing dispute, are poignantly relevant to the ultimate determination of claim of right * * * during the statutory period.” Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 93 (R.I. 2011). The trial justice, in applying this precedent, found that plaintiff “made several arrangements illustrating her acknowledgement and acceptance of', '-6- Dexter’s superior title.” First, the trial justice referenced plaintiff’s knowledge that the deed to Lot 18 did not include the disputed property and her knowledge that it was subject to the 1971 lease to Industrial National Bank “to the extent, if any, that any portion of the demised premises intrude upon the lot conveyed by this deed.” The trial justice acknowledged the distinction between “claim of right” and “color of title” and noted that “mere knowledge concerning a record owner’s superior property right” is not sufficient to destroy a claim for prescriptive easement. See Cahill, 11 A.3d at 90-91.', 'The trial justice also considered an “acknowledgement of [defendant’s] superior title” in the form of a “Notice of Intent to Dispute” filed by plaintiff in 1992, regarding Fleet National Bank’s (then-tenant of Lot 19) encroachment relating to maintenance of its drive-up window. She then concluded that, in light of plaintiff’s “acknowledgement of Dexter’s superior title in the Warranty Deed and the ‘Notice of Intent to Dispute,’” plaintiff had failed to demonstrate the requirements of hostility and claim of right by clear and convincing evidence. We deem this to be error.', 'We initially observe that the notice, upon which the trial justice placed considerable emphasis, was not entered into evidence at trial. 3 The trial justice’s decision references the “Caluori deposition” as the source of the information regarding this notice, yet no deposition was entered into evidence. Accordingly, it was error for the trial justice to rely on facts not in evidence in finding that plaintiff had acknowledged another’s superior title in Lot 19. See Woodstock v. Sherman, 796 A.2d 450, 452 (R.I. 2002) (holding that a trial justice’s reliance on facts not in evidence was reversible error). Even if the notice had been admitted, however, its 3', 'The notice was attached as an exhibit to “Defendant’s Supplemental Bench Memorandum Addressing Plaintiff’s Claims of Easement Rights,” filed in the Superior Court on March 5, 2012, the first day of the trial.', '-7- contents would not support defendant’s argument. In its bench memorandum, defendant made clear that the purpose of the notice was to dispute encroachment “in an entirely different location than the area involved in this action.” On this point, plaintiff and defendant agree; the notice concerns the eastern boundary of Caluori’s property, not the northern boundary where the driveway is located.', 'Similarly, the fact that plaintiff purchased Lot 18 in 1981 with full knowledge that Mrs. Feeney excluded the disputed property does not preclude the possibility that plaintiff used the property adversely thereafter. The 1981 deed may well be relevant to plaintiff’s claim of easement by prescription, but it is not conclusive. Our review of the record reveals sufficient evidence adduced at trial upon which a factfinder could conclude that all the requisite elements of an easement by prescription were established. Whether such evidence is clear and convincing we leave to the factfinder in the first instance. Accordingly, we direct the Superior Court on remand to make further findings of fact relative to plaintiff’s alleged adverse use of the disputed property subsequent to her acceptance of the deed in 1981.', '2', 'Notorious Use', 'The correct inquiry, in establishing notorious use, is whether plaintiff “used the property in a manner consistent with how owners of similar property would use such land and whether these uses were inclined to attract attention sufficient to place the world on constructive notice.” Carnevale v. Dupee, 853 A.2d 1197, 1201 (R.I. 2004). We have long held that a claimant must show “objective trespassory acts that are adverse to the rights of the true owner, not acts that are inconsistent to the use of the true owner.” Butterfly Realty, 45 A.3d at 590. “It is sufficient if one goes upon the land openly and uses it adversely to the true owner, the owner being', '-8- chargeable with knowledge of what is done openly on his land.” Stone v.

The trial justice found that plaintiff used the disputed property openly, but she also found that, because her use was “in common with the general public” and because she did not speak to the record owner about her use of the disputed property, Mrs. Caluori “did not take an affirmative act” to put the record owner on notice.', 'In Butterfly Realty, 45 A.3d at 586, access to the plaintiff’s loading dock was impossible without traversing the defendant’s property, because the plaintiff’s building was located so close to the property line. Despite a recorded easement that the defendant had granted to the plaintiff, a dispute arose about the precise size of the easement, culminating with the defendant placing a barrier on the border of the easement that made it impossible for trucks to pull directly up to the plaintiff’s rear loading dock. Id. at 587. As with the driveway in the instant case, the disputed area in Butterfly Realty was used by the tenants and customers of both parties. Id. at 590. In Butterfly Realty, this Court held “[t]here is no legal precedent, however, requiring [the plaintiff] to prove that its tenants’ use was inconsistent with [the defendant’s] use of the disputed area. In fact, in many prescriptive easement cases, the use made by the claimant is entirely consistent with the use made by the true owner.” Id.', 'In this case, evidence was presented at trial that plaintiff, her tenants, and their invitees used the disputed property to access the commercial building on Lot 18 from West Greenville Road continuously for a period of at least ten years. There was further evidence that the disputed property was also used by bank patrons and invitees as well as by members of the general public who would use the driveway as a cut-through to avoid a traffic light.', '-9-', 'Despite finding that plaintiff’s use of the disputed property was “certainly open,” the trial justice held that the use was not notorious because “Caluori did not take an affirmative act to place Feeney on notice that she was making a claim * * * .” This holding misconstrues the meaning of notoriety under our case law. The affirmative act must be “inclined to attract attention sufficient to place the world on constructive notice.” Carnevale, 853 A.2d at 1201. Once the world is on notice, the record owner of the property is presumed to be on notice, “the owner being chargeable with knowledge of what is done openly on his land.” Butterfly Realty, 45 A.3d at 589 (quoting Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 831).', 'Here, the trial justice found that plaintiff “did enter and occupy the [d]isputed [p]roperty in the manner in which one would ordinarily enter and occupy a driveway,” and that her residential and commercial tenants, staff, and customers had used the disputed property for ingress, egress, and parking consistently and continuously for more than ten years. The trial justice also acknowledged the testimony of Gail Thomas Denton, a witness who lived across West Greenville Road from plaintiff and said that he observed plaintiff’s property on a daily basis for thirteen years. According to the trial justice, Denton', '“confirmed that from approximately 1999 until the present day he', 'has observed use of the [d]isputed [p]roperty for ingress and egress', 'by Caluori, her tenants, and their guests and invitees. Accordingly,', 'it is clear that the actions by Caluori and her tenants were open, as', 'she and her tenants did not act discreetly, nor try and hide their use', 'of the [d]isputed [p]roperty.”', 'We believe that these factual findings are also sufficient to establish the element of notorious use. In fact, we are hard-pressed to find any significant distinction in our case law between an open use and a notorious use. 4 In Tavares, 814 A.2d at 352, in the context of an 4', 'We note that the requirements of open and notorious are distinct in some jurisdictions. “To be open the use must be made without attempted concealment. To be notorious it must be known to', '- 10 - adverse-possession claim, we held that an owner is “chargeable with knowing whatever was done openly on the land he owned—whether or not it could be observed from the road or from the boundary of the property.” Shortly thereafter, in Carnevale, 853 A.2d at 1201, we said that for purposes of establishing open and notorious use, “[t]he proper inquiry [is] whether the party claiming ownership by adverse possession used the property in a manner consistent with how owners of similar property would use such land and whether these uses [are] inclined to attract attention sufficient to place the world on constructive notice.”', 'In the circumstances of the instant case, where there is evidence showing consistent and continuous use of the driveway for the purpose of gaining access from West Greenville Road to the parking area adjacent to the commercial building on plaintiff’s property, a finding of open use is perforce a finding of notorious use. Clearly, plaintiff’s use of the disputed property was consistent with how an owner of a similar property would use a driveway. Moreover, we are satisfied that the use by plaintiff, her tenants, and invitees specifically to gain access to Lot 18 would have attracted attention sufficient to place the world on constructive notice of plaintiff’s adverse claim. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court with respect to its finding that plaintiff failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that her use of the disputed property was notorious in nature. some who might reasonably be expected to communicate their knowledge to the owner * * * .” Foot v. Bauman, 129 N.E.2d 916, 919 (Mass. 1955) (quoting 2 American Law of Property § 8.56 (Casner ed. 1952)). We need not ponder over whether there remains any distinction between open and notorious in Rhode Island; in the context of this case, it is clear that here plaintiff has established that her use was both open and notorious.', '- 11 -', 'B', 'Easement by Implication', 'Alternatively, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in denying her claim for an easement by implication. “We have previously held that[,] ‘[u]pon the severance of an heritage, a grant will be implied of all those continuous and apparent easements which have in fact been used by the owner during the unity, though they have no legal existence as easements.’” Wellington Condominium Association v. Wellington Cove Condominium Association, 68 A.3d 594, 603 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Catalano v. Woodward, 617 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1992)). “An implied easement is predicated upon the theory that when a person conveys property, he or she includes or intends to include in the conveyance whatever is necessary for the use and the enjoyment of the land retained.” Hilley, 972 A.2d at 650 (quoting Bovi v. Murray, 601 A.2d 960, 962 (R.I. 1992)). The test for necessity in this context is “whether the easement is reasonably necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the property as it existed when the severance was made.” Vaillancourt, 986 A.2d at 987-88 (quoting Wiesel, 49 R.I. at 250, 142 A. at 150).', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by conflating the test for easement by necessity5 with that of easement by implication. We are satisfied, however, that the trial justice applied the appropriate standard, considering the facts and circumstances at the time of severance. “The proper inquiry for the existence of an easement by implication * * * focuses on the facts and circumstances at the time of severance.” Vaillancourt, 986 A.2d at 988. 5', '“An easement by necessity ‘is limited to a factual scenario, in which a single owner partitions land and fails to reserve an express easement in favor of the parcel that has become landlocked as a result of the severance.’” Hilley v.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The disturbing facts of this case concern the abuse and molestation of Anna,3 an infant less than four months of age. Anna was born on April 8, 2009 to teenaged parents, Emanuel Baptista and Brenda. At the time of Anna’s birth, the young parents shared an upstairs bedroom 1', 'In violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1 and § 11-37-8.2. 2', 'In violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3(b)(1), § 11-9-5.3(c)(2) and § 11-9-5.3(f). 3', 'The infant has been given a pseudonym, and her immediate family—other than defendant— will be referred to by only their first names in order to protect the child’s privacy.', '-1- in the Pawtucket home of Brenda’s mother, Donna.4 In August 2009, Brenda was training to be a certified nursing assistant, which required her to work approximately two to three hours each morning.', 'Baptista, a certified electrical technician, was working as a cook in Foxboro, Massachusetts. Donna cared for Anna when both parents were working; otherwise, Brenda and Baptista cared for their daughter.', 'On the morning of August 5, 2009, when she departed for work, Brenda left Anna with Baptista. Brenda finished her scheduled shift and was running errands when she received a text message from Baptista, stating that Anna had choked on a baby wipe, but adding that she was fine. Brenda immediately called Baptista to discuss the incident, and Baptista again assured Brenda that Anna was all right. When Brenda returned home later that afternoon, Anna was sleeping. The baby immediately began to cry when Brenda picked her up—behavior that the young mother testified was unusual. Concerned that Baptista might have scratched or otherwise injured Anna’s throat when retrieving the baby wipe, Brenda spoke with her mother and decided to bring the infant to Hasbro Children’s Hospital.', 'Brenda and Baptista took Anna to the hospital’s emergency room, where the infant was seen by both a resident and an attending physician. Brenda told the doctors that Anna had choked on a wipe earlier that day and appeared out of sorts. The doctors initially determined that Anna had a fever and proceeded to examine the child and discovered redness and exudates— secretions consistent with infection—at the back of Anna’s throat. The infant was tested for strep throat; however, the test result came back negative. The doctors noted a small bruise on Anna’s cheek, which they surmised was consistent with a baby of her age attempting to roll over. The resident physician checked the infant’s range of motion and also noted that there were no 4', 'Brenda’s older brother, Cory, and Donna’s fiancé, Robert, also lived in the home at the time.', '-2- apparent bruises or areas of tenderness on Anna’s extremities. Brenda also testified that, after she mentioned that she had seen a tiny spot of blood in the baby’s diaper,5 the resident physician briefly opened and closed Anna’s diaper, seeing nothing amiss. Anna was diagnosed with a sore throat and sent home with a prescription for Tylenol. The resident physician also advised the young parents to follow up with Anna’s pediatrician the next day, and he placed a call to the pediatrician’s office suggesting that an attempt be made to locate the source of the infection that was causing the fever.', 'Brenda testified that she, Anna, and Baptista spent that night together and that she was never away from the baby. Brenda also testified that Anna slept through the night without incident. When Brenda left for work around 7 a.m. on the morning of August 6, 2009, she once again left Anna with Baptista. However, Baptista also had to work that day, and he brought the baby downstairs to Donna around 9 a.m. Donna testified that Anna seemed stiff and not herself that morning; the baby’s lips were severely chapped and red. When Brenda returned home a few hours later, she observed that the infant was in distress. She called Anna’s pediatrician and was given an appointment with a nurse practitioner for that afternoon.', 'Donna accompanied her daughter and Anna to the pediatrician’s office, where they explained that the infant had choked on a baby wipe the previous day and was not acting normally. Brenda also expressed concern that the baby might have a blood disorder that would cause her to bruise easily, due to the numerous bruises she discovered in addition to the one on Anna’s cheek. The nurse practitioner—who had received the phone call the previous night from the Hasbro emergency room—noted that initially, the baby was smiling and in no apparent 5', 'Although Brenda testified to telling the doctors about the spot of blood she noticed in Anna’s diaper before leaving for the hospital, the resident physician testified that he did not recall this comment and made no note that this had been said to him.', '-3- distress, and began the examination by trying to locate the source of the infection causing Anna’s fever.', 'The nurse—assisted by an office assistant—attempted to insert a catheter in order to test for a urinary tract infection. This procedure required her to retract the infant’s labia in order to insert the catheter, at which point a tear of the child’s vagina—which was red and swollen— became apparent. The baby soon became uncooperative and the nurse was unable to complete the procedure. The nurse also noted bruises—in addition to the small bruise on Anna’s cheek— on the baby’s upper forearms and inner thighs, and abrasions around her mouth. The office assistant then asked Brenda, “What’s going on at home?”—at which point the young mother became very upset. The nurse then explained to Brenda and Donna that she was required to report her findings to the Department for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). Brenda and her mother were then asked to take Anna to a nearby lab to have blood work performed and to obtain the results of the urine sample from a small plastic collection bag that was placed in Anna’s diaper.', 'Donna testified that she and Brenda took the infant to two different laboratories for the blood and urine tests and then returned home with the baby. Brenda then left for a short time in order to retrieve her cell phone from a repair store in Cranston.', 'While she was out, an investigator from DCYF arrived at the house and asked that Donna take Anna to Hasbro Children’s Hospital for another examination. Soon thereafter, Donna and Baptista, who had returned from work, took the infant to the hospital; Brenda met them at the hospital.', 'Doctor Carol Jenny (Dr. Jenny), the director of the Hasbro Child Protection Program, and Dr. Rachel Clinenpeel (Dr. Clinenpeel), a fellow in the program, examined Anna in the hospital emergency room. Doctor Jenny testified that she observed bruises and abrasions on Anna’s face,', '-4- inside the infant’s mouth and in her throat; as well as a complete rupture of the baby’s frenulum—the tendon that connects the tongue to the mouth. Doctor Jenny testified that the injuries were caused by the forceful insertion of an object into the baby’s mouth and that the injuries were recent—having occurred no more than three to five days prior. In addition, Dr. Jenny found significant bruising and inflammation of the baby’s labia and vagina, as well as a significant laceration of the hymen which extended to the exterior skin. The doctor testified that the genital trauma was no more than a few days old.', 'Based on her findings, Dr. Jenny placed a seventy-two hour hold on the baby, and admitted Anna to the hospital. Brenda testified that she and her mother became hysterical upon hearing that the child would need to be held at the hospital for further testing, while Baptista sat silently, patting Brenda’s back. Further testing at the hospital revealed that Anna had ten rib fractures that were less than three days old; a fracture of her upper right humerus—the long bone of the upper arm—that was healing; and a recent fracture of her upper left humerus that had not yet begun to heal. Doctor Jenny testified that the rib fractures were likely caused by forcible squeezing, noting that babies’ ribs are flexible and do not break easily.', 'From the hospital, Brenda and Baptista were transported—in separate police cars—to the Pawtucket police station for questioning; Donna followed in her own car. Detective Richard LaForest (Det. LaForest) testified that after advising Baptista of his Miranda rights, he agreed to give a written statement. In his statement, defendant explained that Anna had choked on a baby wipe the day before and that, when he pulled the wipe from her mouth, it was bloody and the child vomited. The defendant further stated that when they brought the baby to the hospital on the evening of August 5, he thought he might have scratched Anna’s throat when extracting the wipe.', '-5-', 'Brenda and her mother consented to the request of Det. Jeffrey Allen (Det. Allen) to search the couple’s bedroom. A cloth that appeared to have bloodstains on it was removed from the baby’s diaper pail, along with other items including bed sheets, baby wipes, and infant pajamas.', 'Some of the items were taken to the Department of Health Forensic Biology Laboratory for testing.6 Anna’s blood was found on the cloth and wipes; a small amount of DNA—from someone other than Anna and Baptista—also was detected.', 'The next day, Friday, August 7, 2009, the couple returned to the police station for further questioning. Detective Charles Devine (Det. Devine) testified that he reviewed the statements previously provided by Anna’s parents and then spoke with Dr. Clinenpeel at the hospital. He again advised defendant of his constitutional rights and defendant signed and dated another rights form. Detective Devine and Det. LaForest then conducted an unrecorded interview of defendant. Detective Devine testified that he showed Baptista close-up photographs of the injuries to Anna’s mouth and genitalia, and told him that according to the doctors, Anna’s injuries could not have happened as he had described. Detective Devine testified that he then told Baptista he needed to tell the detectives what had happened to Anna because she could not speak for herself. According to Det. Devine, after several moments of silence, Baptista told them “I did it,” and disclosed that he had inserted his finger into Anna’s vagina, and that he had put his erect penis in the baby’s mouth and ejaculated. Detective Devine testified that defendant stated that he then placed a wipe in the baby’s mouth—which caused her to choke—and that he used a rag to clean the blood from her vaginal area.', 'After this unrecorded conversation, Det. Devine undertook a videotaped interview, 6', 'For an unexplained reason, only some of the items seized from the home were actually tested for DNA. Notably, the pajamas that Anna was wearing at the alleged time of the sexual molestation were not tested, even though vomit or mucus stains were visible on the front of the garment.', '-6- during which defendant gave a similar statement while Det. Devine simultaneously typed what was being said. The defendant once again explained how he had sexually abused the infant and then inquired whether Anna would be released from the hospital. The video recording reveals that Det. Devine responded that it was customary for the hospital to hold the child for seventy- two hours, and that it was up to the hospital, DCYF, and the court system to decide where she would be placed after that. Detective Devine clarified that, although he could not state precisely where Anna would be placed, he assured defendant that “they make every effort to place the child with a biological relative * * * so you know every effort [is] going to be made to get her back to Brenda or Brenda’s mother.” The defendant’s typed statement was then printed and read aloud to defendant. The defendant requested that two minor changes be made to the statement before he signed it. Shortly thereafter the police were informed that the X-rays revealed that Anna’s ribs and arms also were fractured. Baptista was then questioned further and explained, in great detail, how he inflicted those injuries.', 'Baptista was arrested and subsequently charged by criminal indictment with four felony offenses: two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, one by digital/vaginal penetration (count 1) and one by fellatio (count 2) in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1 and § 11-37-8.2, and two counts of first-degree child abuse on a child under the age of five relating to the infant’s rib fractures (count 3) and arm fractures (count 4), in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9- 5.3(b)(1), § 11-9-5.3(c)(2) and § 11-9-5.3(f).', 'A jury trial commenced on February 16, 2011, and continued over the course of six days. At trial, defendant did not challenge the admissibility of his statements to police,7 and proceeded 7', 'The record reflects that a motion to suppress the items seized and defendant’s statements to police was filed with the Superior Court. However, although a suppression hearing concerning the seized items was held, there is no indication that the motion to suppress the statements made', '-7- to testify—in stark contrast to his confession—that Anna had choked on a baby wipe and that he was not responsible for the extensive injuries inflicted upon his daughter. The defendant also claimed that he had falsely confessed to harming Anna so that the infant would be allowed to return home rather than be placed in foster care. On March 2, 2011—after three full days of deliberation—the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was heard and denied by the trial justice; and, on May 16, 2011, Baptista was sentenced to concurrent life sentences on each count of child molestation. On counts 3 and 4, defendant received concurrent sentences of twenty years, ten to serve, with eight and one-half years to serve prior to eligibility for parole, to run consecutively to the sentences imposed on counts 1 and 2. Before this Court, defendant assigns error to the decision of the trial justice denying his motion for a new trial.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that when presented with a motion for a new trial, “the trial justice must determine ‘whether the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient for the jury to conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)). In doing so, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). Specifically, this requires that “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 354 to police was addressed.', '-8- (R.I. 2011)).', '“If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446). However, if the trial justice does not agree with the jury verdict, “he or she is required to proceed to a fourth step * * * to ‘determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.’” Staffier, 21 A.3d at 290-91 (quoting State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765-66 (R.I. 2011)). “If the verdict meets this standard, then a new trial may be granted.” Id. at 291 (quoting Guerra, 12 A.3d at 766).', '“On appeal, this Court accords ‘great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.’” State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140-41 (R.I. 2008)). A trial justice’s determination will therefore be “left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012)). This Court employs a “deferential standard of review because ‘a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” Id. (quoting Texieira, 944 A.2d at 141).', 'Analysis', 'The defendant’s sole challenge on appeal is to the decision of the trial justice denying his motion for a new trial; he argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconstrued material and relevant evidence.', 'Specifically, defendant argues that the medical evidence conclusively established that when the emergency room doctors examined Anna on the evening of August 5, 2009, she had not been injured. The defendant contends that he therefore could not have', '-9- inflicted the injuries because he was never alone with the infant after that initial hospital visit. The defendant also argues that testimony presented at trial established that the bloody wipes, diapers, and clothes seized in the early morning hours of August 7, 2009 were not discovered until after the first visit to Hasbro and therefore were not present at the time when the state alleges the molestation occurred. Therefore, Baptista maintains, the trial justice overlooked the timing of Anna’s injuries, as well as the fact that defendant’s DNA was not found on the items tested, although a DNA profile of someone other than Anna or defendant was discovered. Lastly, defendant submits that, in denying his motion for a new trial, the trial justice’s view was clouded by his false confession—which defendant claims to have given only to keep Anna from being placed in foster care.', 'We are cognizant that ruling on a motion for a new trial is a responsibility uniquely entrusted to the trial justice. Our careful review of the record in this case shows that the trial justice thoroughly evaluated and discussed the testimony and evidence presented and issued a comprehensive bench decision, setting forth her reasons for denying the motion for a new trial. In this case, the trial justice determined that the state had, in fact, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offenses charged were committed against Anna and that the state had also proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was defendant who perpetrated those crimes against his infant daughter.', 'Concerning the timing of the injuries, the trial justice observed that on August 5, 2009, Anna was presented at the emergency room with the story—concocted by defendant—that the infant had choked on a baby wipe. The doctors proceeded to examine the child for injuries consistent with this account. Anna’s throat was red and she had a temperature. The doctors briefly opened her diaper to determine if a rash was causing her fever; however, seeing no rash,', '- 10 - the doctors closed her diaper, and no further examination of her genital area was conducted. The trial justice noted that the extent of the examination on August 5 was limited and unremarkable, but that the doctor who examined the infant not only requested that her parents follow up with Anna’s pediatrician, he placed a call to the pediatrician’s office.', 'The trial justice also deemed highly credible the testimony of the pediatric nurse who examined Anna on August 6, 2009. That testimony established that bruises on the baby’s arms and thighs were apparent the very next day after the initial visit to the emergency room. Then, in searching for the source of Anna’s fever, the nurse discovered external injuries to Anna’s vagina and—for the first time—the possibility that the infant had suffered some type of physical abuse arose.', 'Finally, the trial justice noted that Dr. Jenny’s comprehensive examination of Anna was specifically undertaken to search for signs of abuse. It was during this examination that Anna’s broken bones were discovered after a full body X-ray scan; also discovered then was the fact that her hymen was torn and that there was a complete rupture of the tiny tendon beneath the infant’s tongue. The trial justice rejected defendant’s contention that, because the full extent of Anna’s injuries was not found until Dr. Jenny’s examination, those injuries were somehow inflicted overnight, after the first visit to Hasbro. The trial justice drew the reasonable inference that the injuries Anna sustained “became more visible with time,” and she found Dr. Jenny’s testimony concerning the age of the injuries and an infant’s normal healing rate to be highly credible.', 'The trial justice also specified that “the absence of DNA evidence linking defendant to the crimes did not negate the other evidence identifying him as the perpetrator.” The trial justice recounted the testimony that seminal fluid would not have remained in the infant’s mouth or throat for any significant amount of time, and therefore, it was inconsequential that semen was', '- 11 - not discovered. The trial justice also concluded that the presence of a minor unidentified DNA profile was not significant, noting that the jury reasonably accepted the testimony that this DNA was inconclusive and could easily have been transferred from another item located near the source. The trial justice found that there was no scientific evidence reasonably suggesting another perpetrator, nor was there “one iota of evidence” that anyone other than defendant, Brenda, or Donna was ever alone with Anna.', 'Finally, the trial justice found defendant’s version of events “outlandish” in light of the other testimony and evidence presented in the case. The trial justice observed that defendant’s testimony did not appear credible and that his demeanor was detached.', 'The trial justice discounted the claim that he falsely confessed, and recounted that, throughout the videotaped confession, defendant was told that the child would be held temporarily and that it would then be up to the hospital, DCYF, and the courts to determine her placement; there was never a suggestion that the child would be mistreated or kept in foster care. The trial justice found it especially inconceivable that, while not disputing that someone had brutally raped and broken the bones of his infant daughter, defendant claims to have confessed so that Anna could be returned to the home where it could happen again by some unknown perpetrator. Although the trial justice noted the “powerful evidence of the defendant’s confession,” she also identified the presence of the baby’s blood on the items tested as corroborative proof. Moreover, defendant’s videotaped confession showed that, when the detectives learned about Anna’s broken bones, defendant described how he had inflicted those injuries in a detailed manner, demonstrating personal knowledge and not speculation. After careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice articulated sufficient reasoning for reaching the same conclusion as the jury and denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '- 12 -', 'The defendant further argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial because the verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice between the parties.

110,State : v. : Kendall Whitaker. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. On the evening of December 4, 2002, a group of friends gathered to celebrate the birthday of Tammy Kennedy at her apartment. However, the intended festivities soon took a tragic turn, and, before the night was over, three people at the party suffered gunshot wounds and one of them, nineteen-year-old Joel Jackson, was dead. The defendant, Kendall Whitaker, eventually was charged, tried, and convicted on multiple counts, including murder, robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license, using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, and committing a crime of violence while armed with a firearm. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. In his appeal, the defendant argues that his trial was infected by a host of errors that require that his convictions be vacated. We have examined the record, the briefs submitted by the defendant and the state, and have listened to the arguments advanced by the parties. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the night of December 4, 2002, a group gathered to celebrate a birthday in the apartment of Tammy Kennedy in Providence. George Toby, who was Kennedy’s friend and was Kennedy’s older son’s football coach, was present, as were Kennedy’s sister Maryann Godfrey, who had previously dated defendant, and Kennedy’s neighbor Candida Morillo.', 'To enhance the festivities, Godfrey, Morillo, and Toby, along with the older of Kennedy’s sons, drove to a supermarket to purchase a birthday cake. When they returned to the apartment, they spoke to Joel Jackson and Corissa Richardson, who were sitting in a car in the parking lot of Kennedy’s apartment building. Toby invited Jackson and Richardson to join them in Kennedy’s apartment.', 'A short time later, defendant, accompanied by Brandon Robinson and Richard Isom, arrived at Kennedy’s apartment. Robinson and Isom had known each other for many years, and they had become acquainted with defendant late in 2002. The trio had congregated earlier in the evening at Robinson’s home. They then decided to go to Kennedy’s apartment to see some of the women whom they expected to be there. 1', 'After Whitaker, Robinson, and Isom arrived at Kennedy’s apartment, Toby engaged them in conversation about mutual acquaintances and the respective areas of Providence where they resided. For some reason, defendant, Robinson, Isom, and Toby withdrew to the hallway outside the apartment. While he was in the hallway, Toby was asked whether he was there to see one of the women present at the party; he replied that he was there to see Kennedy, who was sleeping in a back bedroom at that time. Toby then returned to the apartment alone, leaving Whitaker, 1', 'Robinson and Isom would later agree to testify against Whitaker in exchange for charging and sentencing considerations.', '-2- Robinson, and Isom in the hallway. At trial, Robinson and Isom testified that defendant said that he wanted to steal a gold chain that Jackson was wearing.', 'Robinson and Whitaker then re-entered the apartment, and, according to multiple witnesses, a scuffle soon ensued. Toby, who had emerged from Kennedy’s back bedroom, testified that he saw Robinson and Jackson struggling. Toby testified that he entered the fray himself and attempted to separate the men. As he did, he noticed a gun, and he grabbed Robinson’s hand in an effort to control the weapon. Suddenly, the sounds of gunfire resounded throughout the apartment.', 'Robinson testified that his weapon never discharged and that his gun never left his hand. Toby, who had a hand on Robinson’s gun from the time that he engaged Robinson, also said that the weapon never left Robinson’s hand and that it was never positioned behind Robinson’s back. 2 Toby also testified that when he heard the gunshots, he did not feel any motion from Robinson’s gun.', 'Corissa Richardson 3 testified that she saw defendant remove a handgun from his coat pocket during the struggle for Robinson’s gun and that she watched him point it in the direction of the scuffle. Robinson also testified that Whitaker drew his gun after he came back into the apartment, but no other witness testified that Whitaker was armed during the brawl. 4', 'Robinson further testified at trial that as Jackson collapsed onto him after being shot, he relieved Jackson of the gold chain and medallion that Jackson had been wearing. He put the chain in his pocket and carried the medallion in his hand. Isom testified that he later removed the chain from the pocket of Robinson’s jacket. Robinson said that he held the medallion until 2', 'The evidence disclosed that Robinson was shot in his back. 3', 'Richardson was thirteen years old at the time of this incident but was sixteen at the time of the trial. 4', 'Isom testified that Whitaker had brought a weapon to the apartment.', '-3- he arrived home, but he left it on the trunk of his car while defendant drove him to the hospital. Providence Police later confiscated the medallion from Robinson’s sister.', 'As soon as he regrouped with Isom, Robinson reported that he had been shot by Whitaker, and he asked Isom to bring him to the hospital. However, Isom declined to do so because he had criminal charges pending against him. Instead, he drove Robinson to Robinson’s home. After arriving at his house, Robinson and defendant squabbled about the shooting; Whitaker said that it had been an accident. The defendant then drove the wounded Robinson to Rhode Island Hospital, where defendant was subsequently apprehended by law enforcement.', 'Whitaker eventually was charged with (1) murdering Jackson, (2) robbing Jackson, (3) conspiring to rob Jackson, (4) assaulting Toby with a dangerous weapon, (5) assaulting Robinson with a dangerous weapon, (6) carrying a handgun without a license, (7) using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, (8) discharging a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, and (9) committing a crime of violence while armed and having available a firearm. After trial before a jury, Whitaker was acquitted on the conspiracy count and the charge of assaulting Toby, but he was convicted on the remaining counts.', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion for a new trial, gave confusing or unwarranted instructions in the jury, denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal, improperly told the jury that defendant was in custody, permitted the excessive use of leading questions during the direct examination of the state’s witnesses, and failed to record bench conferences. We will provide additional facts in our discussion where necessary.', '-4-', 'II', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Whitaker first argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion for new trial because the trial justice commented with disdain about the lack of credibility of the witnesses, at one point describing them as “competing liars.” Therefore, he contends that she erred when she said she agreed with the jury’s verdict. The defendant further argues that he should have been granted a new trial because there was insufficient evidence on aiding and abetting to warrant a guilty verdict for that crime. Finally, defendant maintains that he should be entitled to a new trial because the guilty verdict for aiding and abetting Robinson in stealing Jackson’s chain is legally inconsistent with the guilty verdict for assaulting Robinson.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'When a motion for new trial is founded on the weight of the evidence, “a trial justice sits as a thirteenth juror and exercises his or her own independent judgment, assessing the credibility of the witnesses and other evidence, and must ‘choose which conflicting testimony and evidence to accept and which to reject.’” State v. Abdullah, 967 A.2d 469, 479 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994)). When he or she entertains the motion, the trial justice should “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. St. Michel, 37 A.3d 95, 102 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Cerda, 957 A.2d 382, 385 (R.I. 2008)). If the trial justice determines that he or she agrees with the jury’s verdict or that reasonable minds could differ as to the result, then the motion should be denied. Id. “If, however, the trial justice finds', '-5- that the state has failed to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a new trial must be ordered.” Id. (quoting Cerda, 957 A.2d at 385).', 'There is, however, a “distinction between a criminal defendant’s motion for a new trial that attacks the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the guilty verdict and a new-trial motion that contends that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.” State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009)).', 'When confronted with a motion for new trial based on insufficient evidence, “a trial justice must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, without assessing the weight of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses.” Id. (citing Clark, 974 A.2d at 570). “If the trial justice determines that any rational trier of fact could have found that the prosecution established the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then the motion must be denied * * * .” Id. (citing Clark, 974 A.2d at 569, 571).', '“This Court accords great deference to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial ‘if he or she has set forth sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.’” Abdullah, 967 A.2d at 479 (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). We “will not overturn a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial unless he was ‘clearly wrong’ or ‘overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.’” St. Michel, 37 A.3d at 102 (quoting Cerda, 957 A.2d at 386).', '-6-', 'B', 'Discussion', '1', 'Weight of the Evidence', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice found the testimony of the witnesses who were present at the crime scene to be incredible, commenting that she did not think that any of the civilian witnesses told the truth. He maintains that, in light of her comments, she could not have determined that the state was able to satisfy its burden of proof and, when she exercised her independent judgment, she should have granted the motion for new trial. We disagree.', 'In Cerda, 957 A.2d at 386, we affirmed the denial of a motion for new trial based on the weight of the evidence in a case in which the trial justice noted that key witnesses initially had lied about what had occurred. Despite that fact, this Court was satisfied that the trial justice properly discharged his duty in ruling on a motion for new trial; that is, he “appropriately assessed the witnesses’ credibility and determined that the evidence could cause reasonable minds to differ as to the outcome of the case.” Id. (citing State v. Schloesser, 940 A.2d 637, 639 (R.I. 2007)).', 'We similarly affirmed the denial of a motion for new trial in State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 948-49 (R.I. 2012). There, the trial justice relied on Cerda in explaining that, although inconsistencies existed in the testimony of two witnesses, he nonetheless found that the testimony was believable. Id. The trial justice concluded that despite inconsistencies in the testimony of prosecution witnesses, “the thrust or the nub” of their testimony was believable and, conversely, the defendant’s testimony was not believable. Id. at 948. We held that “not only did [the trial justice] conclude that reasonable minds could differ as to what the verdict should be,', '-7- but he also expressly stated that he ‘would have concurred in the unanimous verdict.’” Id. at 949.', 'Here, there can be no disputing that the record reveals a substantial number of inconsistencies in the testimony of the various witnesses. For example, Isom was confronted with the fact that his testimony in front of the grand jury and his trial testimony were inconsistent regarding the size of defendant’s gun, whether there were two guns under defendant’s bed when the trio was at defendant’s home prior to the night in question, and the caliber of defendant’s gun. In his grand jury testimony, Isom also denied having heard defendant mention stealing Jackson’s chain. Cross-examination at trial also confirmed that Isom omitted some details from his grand jury testimony but included them in his testimony at defendant’s bail hearing, such as whether he had seen defendant’s gun and Robinson’s gun at the same time.', 'Robinson similarly was confronted with inconsistencies, such as when he first said that defendant’s gun was .22 caliber. 5 Also, Robinson swore that he had noticed that the bullets to defendant’s pistol were stamped with the notation that they were .22 caliber, although an expert witness testified that a .22-caliber bullet would not carry such a marking.', 'In her bench decision denying the motion for new trial, the trial justice specifically said that, sitting as the thirteenth juror, she was certain that there were two guns in the apartment that fatal night.', 'She also found that, before defendant arrived with his friends, no one at the apartment was armed. With respect to who was armed among Whitaker, Robinson, and Isom, the trial justice found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that Isom had the second gun. Even though she commented that Robinson and Isom lacked credibility on many points, the trial justice noted that they both testified that defendant’s gun appeared to be .22 caliber. The 5', 'On redirect examination, he verified that he had mentioned that fact in his initial statement to police in December of 2002.', '-8- trial justice further relied on Richardson’s testimony that she saw defendant with a gun, concluding that although that witness’s credibility was marginal, the circumstantial evidence undergirded and provided support to her testimony. Significantly, the trial justice “accepted as true the accounts of Brandon Robinson’s * * * exclamations that Whitaker shot him,” and she “believe[d] that Robinson shouted[,] ‘Stop shooting.’” Ultimately, the trial justice found that she would have reached the same result as the jury and that reasonable minds could have differed as to the outcome.', 'The trial justice clearly recognized the inherent difficulties that arose because the witnesses’ testimony was rife with so many inconsistencies, commenting during the hearing on the motion for new trial that she did not “think there was anybody who told the truth in th[e] trial” and that the circumstantial evidence was needed to “sift through and see which of these competing liars [wa]s telling the truth.” The trial justice went on, however, to explain what testimony she accepted and where she found that the testimony was supported by circumstantial evidence. See Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948-49; Cerda, 957 A.2d at 385-86. As was the case in Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948-49, where inconsistencies did not preclude a trial justice from accepting some of a witness’s testimony and denying a new-trial motion based on the weight of the evidence, here the trial justice determined which testimony was credible, and she ultimately concluded that she would have reached the same result as the jury.', 'We accord great deference when we review the decision of a trial justice on a motion for new trial “because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948 (quoting State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 766 (R.I. 2011)); see also State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 106 (R.I. 2013) (explaining that our review is limited to a cold record, so we defer “to', '-9- the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial” (quoting State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010))). The trial justice’s perhaps poorly chosen comments regarding the witnesses’ general credibility notwithstanding, we are of the opinion that she found credible the testimony that there were two firearms in the apartment, that no one was armed except Robinson and Whitaker, that Robinson yelled, “Stop shooting,” and he did say that Whitaker shot him, and that the evidence showed that defendant’s weapon was .22 caliber.', 'In a case such as this that involves conflicting evidence and inconsistent testimony, we cannot say, from our review of a cold record, that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she denied the motion for new trial or that she overlooked or misconceived material evidence relating to a critical trial issue.', '2', 'Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'The defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him under an aiding-and-abetting theory because the jury found that there was no conspiracy, and the only evidence that supported aiding and abetting was the same evidence that supported the conspiracy count, on which defendant was acquitted. However, our review of the record reveals that this issue was not raised before the trial justice and that therefore this argument must fail in accordance with our well-settled waiver rule. See State v. Price, 66 A.3d 406, 416 (R.I. 2013); State v. Moten, 64 A.3d 1232, 1238-39 (R.I. 2013); State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011).', 'As we said in Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235, there is a difference between a motion for new trial that is based on the weight of the evidence and one that is based on the sufficiency of the', '- 10 - evidence. However, irrespective of the grounds that a defendant employs to support his motion for new trial, for us to review the propriety of the denial of such a motion, those grounds must have been preserved in the Superior Court. See id. at 1235-36 (citing State v. Storey, 8 A.3d 454, 460 n.7 (R.I. 2010)). In Karngar, a defendant’s request for a new trial based only on the weight of the evidence did not preserve for appellate review the ground that a new trial was warranted based on insufficient evidence. Id.', 'The defendant’s written motion for new trial merely set forth that he moved, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, that the trial justice order a new trial; it provided no grounds. At the March 17, 2006 hearing on the motion, defendant asked the trial justice to function as the thirteenth juror and assess the evidence and credibility of witnesses. At no point before the Superior Court did defendant cite the sufficiency of the evidence as a basis for a new trial. We thus reach the same conclusion that we reached in Karngar and hold that the denial of a motion for new trial based on insufficient evidence is not properly before us. See Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235-36 (citing Storey, 8 A.3d at 460 n.7).', '3', 'Legal Inconsistency', 'Whitaker also maintains that he is entitled to a new trial because the jury’s guilty verdict for aiding and abetting Robinson in the robbery is legally inconsistent with its guilty verdict for assaulting Robinson.', 'Because a jury has broad power to compromise, “this Court will uphold logically inconsistent jury verdicts provided that the verdicts are legally consistent.” State v. Arroyo, 844 A.2d 163, 170 (R.I. 2004) (citing State v. Romano, 456 A.2d 746, 764 (R.I. 1983)). We have explained that legal inconsistency exists where “the essential elements of the count[s] of which', '- 11 - the defendant is acquitted are identical and necessary to prove the count of which the defendant is convicted.” Id. at 171 (quoting State v. Allessio, 762 A.2d 1190, 1192 (R.I. 2000)).', 'However, to pursue his argument before this Court that he is entitled to a new trial because the jury’s verdicts on two particular counts are legally inconsistent, defendant also must have raised the issue in the Superior Court. See State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”). The defendant did not cite legal inconsistency as a basis for granting a new trial in his motion for new trial, nor did he argue it when the motion was heard. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the issue is not properly before us and that there is nothing for this Court to review.', 'III', 'Jury Instructions', 'The defendant contends that the instructions provided by the trial justice to the jury were deficient in multiple ways: first, that there was insufficient evidence to warrant an instruction on aiding and abetting; second, that the trial justice failed to instruct the jury on intent; and third, that the instructions were confusing to the jury.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'We review jury instructions de novo. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1031. “[W]hen instructing the jury, the trial justice ‘should reasonably set forth all of the salient and essential propositions of law that relate to material issues of fact which the evidence tends to support.’” State v. Fisher, 844 A.2d 112, 116 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 996-97 (R.I. 1996)). To justify directing the jury’s attention to a proposition of law, the record must contain evidence', '- 12 - that supports it. Id. (citing LaRoche, 683 A.2d at 997); see also State v. Garcia, 883 A.2d 1131, 1137 (R.I. 2005) (“It is incumbent upon a trial justice to instruct the jury on the law that applies to each issue that the parties raise at trial.” (citing State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1112 (R.I. 2003))).', 'This Court assesses jury instructions “to determine how a ‘jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them.’” Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1031 (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 929 (R.I. 2005)). Rather than “isolat[ing] a challenged portion from the instructions as a whole,” “[w]e scrutinize the jury instructions in their entirety in order to ascertain whether or not a particular instruction misled or confused the jury.” Id. (citing John, 881 A.2d at 929; State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 796 (R.I. 2004)).', 'According to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” This constraint allows the trial justice “to cure the alleged deficiencies before the jury retires for deliberations.” State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 935 (R.I. 2005)).

Long, 61 A.3d 439, 447 (R.I. 2013), we had the opportunity to consider what evidence justified an instruction on aiding and abetting. In that case, one participant in a marijuana-growing operation agreed to testify against another, and that testimony established that the defendant was present at the initial meeting where the operation was planned and that she suggested that a proper water supply be ensured. Id. This Court held that the “testimony that defendant was at [the site of the growing operation] on a number of occasions was sufficient to support the jury charge with respect to aiding and abetting.” Id.', 'Here, Whitaker maintains that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support an aiding-and-abetting instruction because there is no evidence in the record to establish an action consistent with his supposed criminal intent.', 'The defendant overlooks, however, that the testimony of Isom and Robinson includes their statements that he arrived at the apartment armed, that before re-entering the apartment he expressed an interest in taking Jackson’s chain, that he and Robinson then re-entered the apartment, and that Robinson actually took Jackson’s chain. Further, Richardson testified that during the struggle over Robinson’s gun, she observed defendant draw a gun and aim it towards the scrum.', 'We are of the firm opinion that, based on the evidence presented during the trial, it was not improper for the trial justice to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting.

Perry, 770 A.2d 882, 886 (R.I. 2001), where a defendant argued that an instruction that the jury should acquit if it found that there was “‘a real possibility’ that he was not guilty.” This Court said that “[d]efining for a jury when doubt is reasonable, while an inexact science, does not shift the burden of proof to the defendant when no part of the definition contradicts the court’s plain instruction that the burden is entirely the [s]tate’s.” Id. at 886 (quoting State v. Castle, 935 P.2d 656, 661 (Wash. App. 1997)). We also explained that although an instruction may “‘engender some confusion as to the burden of proof if it stood by itself,’ * * * the overall charge is ‘sufficient to dispel any possible confusion or misunderstanding arising from the reasonable doubt definition’” if it accurately describes the burden of proof. Id. (quoting State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1257 (R.I. 1998)).', 'We are convinced that the jury charge in this case sufficiently and accurately described the state’s burden of proof. Although the trial justice, early in the charge, informed the jury that its task was to determine what happened rather than to determine whether the state proved the elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, the instructions, viewed in their entirety, did', '- 15 - not shift the burden of proof to defendant. See Perry, 770 A.2d at 886. For example, the trial justice explained that', '“[i]n all criminal cases, the [s]tate or the prosecution has the', 'burden of producing evidence sufficient to prove the defendant’s', 'guilt. The [s]tate must produce evidence to support each and every', 'one of the elements or components of the crimes charged. The', '[s]tate also carries the burden of producing enough evidence so', 'that in the minds of the jurors, the defendant’s guilt has been', 'proved beyond a reasonable doubt as to each element or', 'component of the crimes charged.” The trial justice then instructed the jury on the individual offenses with which Whitaker was charged, including the elements for each and informing the jury that if the state failed to prove any of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then the jury should acquit defendant.', 'Viewing the jury charge in its entirety, we conclude that the instructions were not likely to mislead the jury about the burden the state had to prove each of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.', '3', 'Remaining Instructions', 'Whitaker also argues that the trial justice erred because she failed to include a separate instruction on intent. He maintains that the jury must not have understood the instructions because it illogically convicted defendant of assaulting the very person whom he was convicted of aiding and abetting. Whitaker similarly argues that the jury was confused by the instructions, confusion that he argues is evidenced by verdicts of guilty of aiding and abetting but of not guilty of conspiracy.', '- 16 -', 'Neither this argument nor the objection, however, was brought to the attention of the trial justice at the appropriate time. 6 Whitaker’s written exceptions to the jury instructions were separated into objections, requests for written edits, and requests for oral instructions; none of them suggests that the jury charge inadequately outlined the law regarding intent. There simply was no objection that the charge lacked clarity or that it was confusing. Indeed, after she instructed the jury and received defendant’s objections, the trial justice discussed those objections with counsel on the record; defendant made no additional objections.', 'Because it was incumbent upon defendant to object to the instructions before the jury began its deliberations so that the trial justice might have the opportunity to correct any errors, the failure to raise these objections at the appropriate time constrains us to conclude that they were not preserved for our review.', 'IV', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'At trial, defendant made a motion for judgment of acquittal on counts five, seven, and eight, which were for assaulting Robinson with a dangerous weapon, using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, and discharging a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence.

The total sentence imposed on the various counts of conviction amounted to consecutive life sentences plus forty years, with at least sixty years to serve. 4', 'II', 'Discussion', 'The defendant predicates his appeal on two grounds. First, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in allowing testimony about gang affiliation, physical altercations between defendant and Soko, and the unsolved murder of Darren Regans. Second, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he denied his motion for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, because defendant claimed he was twice placed in jeopardy in that counts 4 and 6 should have merged.', 'A', 'Motions in Limine', 'Before the trial began, defendant filed several motions in limine in an effort to exclude certain testimony under Rules 403 and 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 5 First, defendant moved to exclude any testimony relating to either gang affiliation or retaliation between YNIC and Comstock because such testimony was without probative value and was unduly prejudicial. In response, the trial justice ruled that he would admit “some” discussion of gang affiliation and the contention that YNIC and Comstock were at odds for the purposes of 4', 'The trial justice sentenced defendant to life sentences on counts 1 and 3, to be served consecutively, ten years for count 2, to be served concurrent with count 1; twenty years for count 4, to be served consecutive to count 3; ten years for count 5, to be served concurrently with count 4; twenty years for count 6, to be served without parole and consecutive to count 4; and ten years for count 7, to be served concurrently with count 1. 5', 'Of note, defendant did not refer specifically to either Rules 403 or 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence in his motions in limine, but he did state that the testimony is “unduly prejudicial and without probative value.” It appears from the record that the trial justice considered the motions in limine to have been filed seeking to exclude the testimony pursuant to those rules.', '-5- voir dire during jury selection. He also ruled that he would delay ruling on the motion and would hear further arguments from counsel after jury selection.', 'Next, defendant moved for an order restricting Soko from testifying about the stabbing he suffered at the 2007 party, and his subsequent physical altercation with defendant, because Soko could not swear that defendant stabbed him. Soko could only testify that, based on defendant’s presence when the stabbing took place, he assumed defendant had stabbed him. The trial justice delayed ruling on that motion until trial, when the parties could make their respective arguments as to the relevance of the testimony. The trial justice also deferred ruling on a final motion in limine, which was defendant’s motion to exclude any testimony about the unsolved homicide of Darren Regans. 6', '1', 'Standard of Review', ""We review a trial justice’s admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion.

This motion is not before us because defendant does not raise it on appeal.', '-6-', '2', 'Analysis', 'Before we consider the merits of defendant’s appeal, we must first address whether the issues are properly before us. We consistently have held that we will review only those issues that have been properly preserved for appellate review. State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 345 (R.I. 2005) (citing State v.

Mastracchio, 612 A.2d 698, 704 (R.I. 1992) (citing Long, 488 A.2d at 432). “A party who fails to assert his specific objections is deemed to have waived his rights on appeal.” Long, 488 A.2d at 432 (citing Russell v. Kalian, 414 A.2d 462, 465 (R.I. 1980)).', 'The defendant first argues that the trial justice erred in admitting evidence of gang affiliation. However, the record indicates that defendant failed to object to the introduction of this testimony. It is a basic rule of our appellate practice that it is inappropriate for us to consider an issue on appeal when no objection was interposed at trial. See State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1107 (R.I. 1999) (citing State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965, 973 (R.I. 1994)). In addition and of equal significance, defendant appeared to have actively withdrawn the motion in limine because he intended to use gang affiliation testimony during cross-examination of the state’s witnesses.', '-7- At the conclusion of the State’s case, the trial justice had the following colloquy with counsel for defendant:', '“THE COURT: Okay. There was some discussion prior to trial on', 'your motion, defendant’s motion, regarding discussion of gangs. It', 'was left open that eventually we will get to it before the [jury] was', 'sworn. The record is barren of any discussion about it, and that is', 'because, informally, we’ve had discussions, although it’s never', 'been recorded, that the trial strategy and other tactical reasons, the', 'defense has decided early on, that it would not pursue such a', 'motion, because, number 1) it was going to be, in large part, part of', 'cross-examination.

I did speak with Mr. Young about those issues,', 'specifically gangs and YNIC and Comstock, and I explained to', 'him my thought processes about using it in cross-examination of at', 'least Torell Soko, and he agreed to let me do so * * * .”', 'Thus, defendant appears to have made a conscious decision to employ this line of questioning and he cannot now object to its admission on his appeal. The trial justice ruled that “some evidence” of gang affiliation could come in during jury selection. The above colloquy aside, to preserve this issue for appeal, defendant had the obligation to object during the trial to introduction of this testimony. It is clear to us that defendant has waived the issue on appeal because the absence of any objection and the use of the testimony about gang affiliation on defense precludes our consideration. 7 7', ""Despite disposing of this issue for defendant’s failure to preserve, it does not appear that the trial justice ran afoul of Rule 403 when he admitted this evidence. Rule 403 states that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * * .” It “is well settled that we review a trial justice's decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 851 (R.I. 2010)). We will reverse a trial"", '-8-', ""The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed testimony about the murder of Darren Regans, a member of Comstock, in 2007. The defendant maintains that admitting testimony of Regans’s stabbing death at a Providence nightclub may have led the jury to believe that Comstock murdered Benton because Benton had been questioned about the Regans killing. However, again we do not reach the merits of this argument because defendant did not preserve this issue for appeal. Indeed, at several points throughout the trial, defendant failed to object when the state questioned a witness about the murder of Darren Regans. As we have stated on occasions too numerous to cite, we will not consider issues on appeal that were not objected to at trial. Moreover, during the cross-examination of Soko, defendant himself asked questions relating to the murder of Darren Regans. At one point during the state’s direct examination of Soko, defendant objected to a question relating to Darren Regans’s affiliation with Comstock, but he failed to offer any basis for the objection. As we held in Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 704, a defendant must raise a specific objection or he has waived the right to argue justice's ruling on the admissibility of evidence only where “it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.” Id.; see also State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 862 (R.I. 2013); State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012). A trial justice is only required to exclude testimony when “evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial.” Covington, 69 A.3d at 863 (quoting Smith, 39 A.3d at 675). Here, both defendant and Benton were acknowledged members of Comstock and YNIC, respectively. The introduction of some evidence of the ongoing conflicts between the two groups was not enormously prejudicial to defendant."", 'Under Rule 404(b), “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.” We have previously held “that Rule 404(b) is designed to prohibit the introduction of evidence that is relevant only to show that the defendant is a bad person and, therefore, likely to have committed the offense with which he is charged.” State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 861 (R.I. 2008). “[S]uch evidence is admissible if it tends to establish, ‘guilty knowledge, intent, motive, design, plan, scheme, system, or the like.’” Id. (quoting State v. Lemon, 497 A.2d 713, 720 (R.I. 1985)). The prior altercations defendant had with Benton and Soko were probative of a feud between YNIC and Comstock that could have served as a source of defendant’s motive to retaliate or seek retribution.', '-9- the issue on appeal. Here, counsel for defendant simply stated, “objection,” without providing any basis for the objection. Thus, we consider the argument waived. 8', 'Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed testimony about the stabbing of Soko and the subsequent physical altercation between Soko and defendant the following day. Young emphasizes that Soko admitted he did not know who stabbed him, only that defendant was present along with several other members of Comstock. Therefore, he argues that introduction of this testimony only served to demonstrate defendant’s violent propensity. But, as with the previous two arguments, this issue also fails because it was not preserved for appeal. At no point did defendant object to questions by the state designed to elicit testimony from Soko relating to his prior confrontations with defendant. It is true that defendant did file a motion in limine on which the trial justice deferred ruling, but defendant failed to raise the issue again even when prompted by the trial justice at the conclusion of the state’s presentation. As a result, we hold that this argument has also been waived. See State v. Burke, 529 A.2d 621, 627 (R.I. 1987). 9 8', 'We would note that we see no error in the trial justice’s ruling in any event. Rule 404(b) seeks to prevent bad act evidence of a defendant which would tend to demonstrate that there is “a probability that he has committed the crime on trial because he is a man of criminal character.” State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 624, 382 A.2d 526, 532 (1978) (quoting McCormick, Evidence § 190 at 447 (2d ed. 1972)). Here, however, the murder of Darren Regans is purported to have been committed by a victim, not by defendant. Furthermore, the testimony related to the Regans murder was highly probative of the state’s theory of retaliation because it tended to demonstrate defendant’s motivation to commit the offenses with which he was charged. 9', 'Even if we were to reach the merits, we are loath to see how we would disturb the trial justice’s decision to admit this testimony because of its evidentiary relevance as to motive. The record indicates that some months before the alleged stabbing, Soko and Young had a verbal confrontation at Providence Place Mall. Soon after, the two also had an argument at the party where Soko was stabbed. The day after the stabbing incident, Soko and Young had a physical altercation on Trask Street after Soko accused Young of stabbing him, and Soko punched defendant. This testimony is certainly probative of defendant’s motive for the July 12, 2009 incident and is not unduly prejudicial.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'Double Jeopardy', 'The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'At trial, defendant asserted a double-jeopardy claim, arguing that pursuant to Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), count 6, discharging a firearm in commission of a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3.2, merged with count 4, assault with intent to murder in violation of § 11-5-2. The trial justice conducted a Blockburger analysis and ultimately denied the motion, ruling that each offense required separate elements, notably that assault with a dangerous weapon does not require the use of a firearm. Although we agree with the trial justice’s denial of the Rule 29 motion, we arrive at our conclusion after treading a different path.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'An alleged violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, “‘a mixed question of law and fact of constitutional dimension[,]’ and therefore our review of such a claim is de novo.” State v.

(citing Hunter, 459 U.S. at 367–68).', 'Although the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in his Blockburger analysis in ruling that there was no double jeopardy, we need not reach Blockburger because the intent of the Legislature with respect to these statutes is crystal clear. We have not had the occasion to address cumulative sentencing with respect to the relationship between § 11-47-3.2, use of a firearm in a violent crime, and § 11-5-2, assault with intent to murder; however, we have examined recently the interplay between § 11-47-3.2 and § 11-39-1, robbery, in Marsich, 10 A.3d at 442-43.

Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 793 (R.I. 2007), which involved a double-jeopardy claim for consecutive life sentences for murder and for using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, we reaffirmed our decisions in State v. 11', 'According to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-2(2), “crime of violence” means “assault with a dangerous weapon, assault or battery involving grave bodily injury, and/or assault with intent to commit any offense punishable as a felony; upon any conviction of an offense punishable as a felony offense under [G.L. 1956] § 12-29-5.”', '- 13 - Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 648 (R.I. 2006) and Rodriguez, 822 A.2d at 904–08, where we concluded under Hunter that convictions for both crimes do not merge for double-jeopardy purposes.

However, the legal description also included the following paragraph: “Being all of the same premises conveyed by deed of Arthur Passarelli to Kenneth R.

The Option One Mortgage was recorded on October 12, 2005 at book 2174, page 166.', 'In a quitclaim deed dated August 24, 2006, and recorded in November 2006, Stebenne conveyed the vacant lot to his son, Timothy David Stebenne.

It is significant that Aurora’s closing attorney noted the inconsistencies between the metes and bounds description in the Option One Mortgage and the reference to the warranty deed conveying the property to Stebenne, as well as the assessor’s plat and lot number. In researching the inconsistency, Aurora’s closing attorney questioned whether the Option One Mortgage applied to the house lot as well as the vacant lot. He then conferred with the title insurance company’s counsel, and both attorneys came to the conclusion that the Option One Mortgage only applied to the vacant lot.4 Aurora’s closing attorney did not, however, contact Option One to clarify whether the Option One Mortgage was intended to encumber the house lot.', 'Thereafter, Stebenne defaulted on his loan to Option One.

In Barnacle, this Court answered two questions of law based on two discrete fact patterns certified by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. The first question involved the validity of an otherwise properly-recorded mortgage that was incorrectly executed because one of the two joint mortgagors failed to properly execute it. See Barnacle, 623 A2d at 446. The second question asked whether, even though the mortgage’s legal description described the entire condominium building rather than a single condominium unit, the mortgage provided constructive notice that it was intended to apply to that single unit. 5 See id. We held that an instrument, although it may be technically defective, imparts constructive notice to a subsequent purchaser if it is properly filed and recorded in the land evidence records. See id. at 449. We further held that “[a] mortgage will not be held void for uncertainty, even as to third persons, 5', 'The mortgage in Barnacle was executed on the same day as an Assignment of Leases and Rents, which described the specific condominium unit and was recorded in the land evidence records on the page immediately following the mortgage.', '-6- where by any reasonable construction it can be sustained; and where the description used furnishes a key whereby a person, aided by extrinsic evidence, can ascertain what property is covered, such description is sufficient.” Id. at 451 (quoting Caraway Bank v. United States, 529 S.W.2d 351, 351-52 (Ark. 1975)).', 'It is well established that Rhode Island law gives “the broadest possible effect to constructive notice.” Speedy Muffler King, Inc. v. Flanders, 480 A.2d 413, 415 n.1 (R.I. 1984). Accordingly, any properly recorded instrument is sufficient to provide constructive notice of its contents to a subsequent purchaser. See Barnacle, 623 A.2d at 449; see also G.L. 1956 § 34-13-2 (stating that a recorded instrument “shall be constructive notice to all persons of the contents of instruments and other matters so recorded, so far as they are genuine”). Here, there is no dispute that the Option One Mortgage was properly recorded in the Land Evidence Records of the Town of North Providence. Any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee, including Aurora, was charged with constructive notice of the contents of the Option One Mortgage.', 'We further agree with the hearing justice that the prior deed reference in the Option One Mortgage description was sufficient to put a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee on notice that the Option One Mortgage was intended to encumber both the house lot and the vacant lot. We emphasize that, in conducting a title search of the property, Aurora’s closing attorney found the Option One Mortgage and further recognized the internal inconsistencies in the Option One Mortgage description.', 'Aurora cites a number of cases from other jurisdictions relating to mortgage description errors. We find these cases to be unpersuasive and largely distinguishable from the instant matter. For example, in In re Stanphill, 312 B.R. 691, 694 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. 2004), the mortgage at issue entirely omitted a reference to certain properties, which were separate and', '-7- distinct from the other properties actually described in the mortgage. Here, in contrast, the Option One Mortgage did contain, in addition to the prior deed reference, some description of the house lot through the tax assessor’s plat and lot number and the street address. Similarly, the other cases cited by Aurora are inapplicable to the instant case as they also involved mortgage descriptions that entirely failed to describe the encumbered properties and consequently failed to trigger any duty of further inquiry on a reasonable title searcher. See, e.g., Trask v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 462 B.R. 268, 276 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2011) (holding that where a mortgage description provided only the street address that applied to two adjacent lots, there was nothing in the description to cause a title searcher to suspect that the description was somehow incorrect and consequently the mortgage did not provide constructive notice); In re Stradtmann, 391 B.R. 14, 19 (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 2008) (“If there is nothing in the property description to trigger a duty of further inquiry, then a conflict between the legal description and the common address is not apparent, and therefore does not trigger constructive or implied notice.”).', 'The facts here are easily distinguishable from the above-cited cases. Aurora’s closing attorney discovered the Option One Mortgage and noticed the inconsistencies in the mortgage description. Indeed, the attorney specifically questioned whether the Option One Mortgage encumbered the house lot. As such, we find that Aurora at least had constructive notice of the existence of the Option One Mortgage and could have ascertained whether the Option One Mortgage encumbered the house lot. The fact that both Aurora’s closing attorney and the title insurance company’s counsel came to a contrary conclusion does not protect Aurora from the broad application of constructive notice in Rhode Island. Accordingly, we hold that the Option One Mortgage is a valid first lien on the house lot.', '-8-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Option One.

Lopez (Lopez or defendant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for breaking and entering and for felony assault with a dangerous weapon by choking with his hands. On appeal, Lopez contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial; erred in not permitting him to question the jurors during voir dire about the reliability of eyewitness testimony; and erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of felony assault. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the morning of April 15, 2008, Isaidely Negron unlocked the door of her apartment on Dexter Street in Central Falls which she then shared with her fiancé and her ten-month-old daughter. Her fiancé had left for work, and she was expecting her sister to arrive soon. She decided to watch TV while waiting for her sister but fell asleep while on her bed.', '-1-', 'Ms. Negron was awoken at some time after that when she heard the door open and saw a “dark-skinned man” walk into the apartment. She testified at trial that, from her bed, she had a “perfect view” to the apartment door.', 'The intruder told Ms. Negron not to move, picked up a coat from the kitchen chair, climbed on top of her, covered her face with the coat and began to suffocate her. At trial, Ms. Negron demonstrated how the intruder was choking her by putting her right hand around her neck in a choking fashion. 1 Ms. Negron testified that she struggled and scratched the intruder’s arms and that, at some point during the struggle, she felt his hands at her waist. The intruder threatened her, saying, “Don’t move or I’ll kill you.” During the struggle, the coat came off her face, allowing her to see. She then grabbed a plastic water bottle from beside the bed and hit the intruder with it, striking him on the side of the neck. Ms. Negron stated that, at this point in the struggle, she was briefly face to face with the intruder. The intruder turned and ran out of the bedroom and Ms. Negron chased him out of the apartment and then locked the apartment door. Ms. Negron testified that, after locking the door, she saw that the time was 8:10 a.m.', 'Later that morning, Ms. Negron went to her sister’s apartment and had her call the police. She then went to the Central Falls police station to file a witness statement. Photographs were taken of scratches on her face, chest, and arms as a result of the struggle. Ms. Negron described the intruder as being an “average-size man, dark skin, short hair” and wearing “a short-sleeved shirt and light blue jeans.” The Central Falls Police did not dust for fingerprints at the apartment nor did they obtain any DNA evidence from Ms. Negron’s fingernails. 2 Detective Jeff Araujo of 1', 'We note that in testifying, Ms. Negron stated that the intruder used his “hands” in choking her but when asked to demonstrate, the record reflected that she put only her right hand around her neck. 2', 'Ms. Negron testified that, during the struggle with the intruder, she had purposely scratched his arms in an effort to collect his DNA under her fingernails.', '-2- the Central Falls Police testified that Ms. Negron did not mention at that time that the intruder spoke with an accent.', 'A few days later, on April 20, 2008, Ms. Negron was on the porch of her apartment overlooking the driveway to the house. A car drove in and parked in the driveway and the driver passed by Ms. Negron’s door wearing a “sweater” with a hood over his head. Ms. Negron identified the driver, who she later discovered lived above her in the same building, as being the intruder who had entered her apartment. She called the police immediately to inform them.', 'Detective Araujo put together a photo array that included a Department of Motor Vehicles license picture of defendant. Prior to being shown the photos, Ms. Negron was given an instruction form informing her that she was not obligated to identify anyone from the photo array.', 'Nevertheless, Ms. Negron identified defendant’s picture from it.', 'Detective Araujo testified that, upon being shown the array, Ms. Negron immediately began to shake and cry and seemed “almost like she was afraid of the photographs.”', 'Detective Araujo learned that defendant worked at Chili’s Bar & Grill in Lincoln, about four and a half miles away from Ms. Negron’s apartment.', 'According to Detective Araujo, the distance between Ms. Negron’s apartment and Chili’s could be traveled by car in approximately eleven to fifteen minutes. Detective Araujo secured an arrest warrant but he was unable to locate defendant on April 22, 2008. Lopez, however, turned himself in to the police later that night.', 'According to Richard Sliwinski, Jr., defendant’s manager at Chili’s at the time, the restaurant’s computerized time records showed that defendant clocked into work at 8:30 a.m. on the morning of April 15, 2008. Sliwinski, who was called as a witness by defendant, explained that the restaurant’s computer that records employees’ hours does not permit employees to clock in prior to their scheduled start time, regardless of when they arrive. Sliwinski testified that it', '-3- was defendant’s usual habit at the time to arrive at least half an hour prior to his scheduled time because he took the bus to work. Sliwinski said that defendant is bilingual but speaks English with a definite “Spanish accent.” He admitted that he had no specific recollection of defendant’s arrival or conduct on April 15, 2008, but stated that if he had observed any scratches on defendant’s hands, he would have addressed the issue as to “whether it was reasonable for him [defendant] to work or not” because of “a possible * * * food issue.”', 'Criminal Information No. P2/08-1764A charged Lopez with four criminal offenses: count 1, breaking and entering in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2; count 2, assault with intent to murder in violation of G.L. § 11-5-1; count 3, felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2; and count 4, assault in violation of § 11-5-3. 3 The state dismissed counts 2 and 4 prior to jury selection.', 'Jury impaneling took place on February 11 and 12, 2010, and the trial took place on February 12 and 15, 2010. During impanelment, defense counsel began to question the jurors regarding their opinion of eyewitness testimony through the following exchange:', '“[Defense counsel]: Because the Super Bowl was this past week, I think I’m', 'going to start with sort of a football question.

The trial justice heard arguments from both counsel at a sidebar conference and expressed some concerns about questioning the jurors on the subject, saying, “Well, if you ask a juror what that person expects that would be necessary for them to accept an eyewitness testimony and this witness doesn’t meet that expectation, they’re going to be somehow bound to say, because I answered that young attorney that way, I can’t believe this witness.”', 'The trial justice sustained the state’s objection, reasoning,', '“You can do that in argument.

At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of felony assault with a dangerous weapon. The defendant argued that the evidence did not support the felony assault charge because it was not clear that the intruder’s hands were, in fact, used in such a way that was likely to produce substantial bodily harm as Ms. Negron did not testify to the length of time or the intensity of the choking.', '-5- The trial justice denied the motion on the grounds that Ms. Negron’s testimony about how defendant straddled her and choked her was sufficient because “a choke, if carried to its natural conclusion, would probably cause death.” 4', 'At the close of all the evidence and after the trial justice instructed the jury, 5 the jury found Lopez guilty on the charges of breaking and entering and of felony assault with a dangerous weapon.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which was heard on February 26, 2010. The defendant argued that he had an “imperfect” alibi for the time the crime took place because he had clocked in to work by 8:30 a.m. and he was in the habit of arriving at least half an hour before his shift was due to begin, which gave him very little time after the assault on Ms. Negron in which to get to work. He also emphasized that no one at work on April 15, 2008 noticed anything unusual about him, such as any marks or scratches on his face or hands that would be consistent with the struggle that took place with Ms. Negron. The defendant further contended that his actions in turning himself in to the police a few days later were not the actions of a guilty man. Finally, Lopez focused on the lack of physical evidence to tie him to the crime and argued that eyewitness testimony such as Ms. Negron’s is unreliable.', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, finding that Ms. Negron’s testimony was “extremely credible” and noting that “no evidence * * * has been uncovered to shake the confidence of the Court in her identification.” The trial justice recalled that “all of the individuals in that photo-pack look amazingly alike” and noted that Ms. Negron identified 4', 'The defendant renewed the motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.

Judgment of conviction entered on September 14, 2010. 6', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Lopez raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the weight of the evidence did not support the jury verdicts. Second, he contends that the trial justice’s decision not to permit defense counsel to question prospective jurors about eyewitness testimony during voir dire was in error. Lastly, Lopez maintains that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon because the evidence was insufficient to prove that the intruder’s hands were used as a dangerous weapon as required by § 11-5-2. We address each of these issues in turn. 6', 'This Court deems a direct appeal filed prior to the entry of final judgment to be timely. See State v.

Id. at 862. “The trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v.

We disagree. The jury was entitled to weigh the evidence regarding the inference of defendant’s', '-8- alibi when deliberating and found it wanting. We cannot state that the jury’s verdict was entirely unsupported by the evidence.', 'We find no error in the trial justice’s decision denying Lopez’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice set out the correct standard and then summarized complainant’s testimony. The trial justice acknowledged the possibility that Ms. Negron was mistaken in her identification of Lopez as the intruder but stated that he found her testimony to be credible and the jury was entitled to find her credible as well. The trial justice also addressed the issue of defendant’s “imperfect” alibi but ultimately concluded that it was insufficient because it was possible to drive from Ms. Negron’s apartment in Central Falls to the restaurant in Lincoln in the time between the intruder’s leaving the apartment and when defendant had clocked in to work. The trial justice finally stated that he agreed with the jury verdict.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice adequately articulated his reasoning in denying the motion for a new trial. Once the trial justice had determined that he agreed with the jury verdict, he was correct in denying the motion for a new trial. Moreover, the trial justice clearly set forth and considered the factors which this Court has used in determining the credibility of eyewitness testimony in weighing Ms. Negron’s testimony.

During voir dire, defense counsel began to question potential jurors about their opinions of the reliability of eyewitness testimony, using the example of Super Bowl referees. After a sidebar discussion with counsel, the trial justice curtailed defense counsel’s line of questioning, stating that the reliability of the complaining witness’s identification could more properly be questioned during argument.', 'We discern no error in the trial justice’s decision.

Zangrilli, 440 A.2d 710, 711 (R.I. 1982). This Court has never stated that any specific duration or intensity is necessary for choking with a person’s hands to constitute assault with a dangerous weapon. In this case, the complainant testified and described at trial how the intruder straddled her as he had his hand around her neck in a choking fashion. We are satisfied that the complainant’s testimony is sufficient to support the conviction on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. Regardless of the injuries actually suffered by the complainant, this Court agrees with the trial justice’s statement that “a choke, if carried to its natural conclusion, would probably cause death.” This Court has repeatedly held that “[t]he test is not whether serious bodily injury results from the assault, but whether the object was so used that serious bodily injury may have resulted.” State v.

After denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice sentenced defendant to the maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole pursuant to § 11-23-2(4). Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 993. The defendant appealed his conviction to this Court, and we affirmed after conducting an independent review of the sentence. Id. at 1002-03. On June 29, 2011, defendant filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to Rule 35. A second justice of the Superior Court denied the motion to reduce his sentence. The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court.', 'Standard of Review', 'We have stated on many occasions that “[a] motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 is ‘essentially a plea for leniency.’” State v. Ruffner, 5 A.3d 864, 867 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R.I. 2008)). “The motion is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, who may grant it if he or she decides ‘on reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.’” Mendoza, 958 A.2d at 1161 (quoting State v. Furtado, 774 A.2d 38, 39 (R.I. 2001)). This Court consistently has followed a “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters.” State v. Tavera, 936 A.2d 599, 600 (R.I. 2007) (mem.) (quoting State v. Ferrara, 818 A.2d 642, 644 (R.I. 2003)). Accordingly, our review of a trial justice’s denial of a motion to reduce sentence is “extremely limited.” Furtado, 774 A.2d at 39. Indeed, we will disturb such a decision only “‘in rare instances when’ the sentence imposed is one ‘without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar', '-2- offenses.’” State v. Burke, 876 A.2d 1109, 1112 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Morris, 863 A.2d 1284, 1287 (R.I. 2004)). “The defendant has ‘the burden of showing that the sentence imposed violated this standard.’” Mendoza, 958 A.2d at 1162 (quoting Furtado, 774 A.2d at 39).', 'Analysis', 'Before the justice who heard the motion, defendant argued that he was not the same person that he had been at the time of the death of the victim, and he pressed the hearing justice to give him the opportunity for rehabilitation so that he could someday be released from incarceration. The defendant also contended before the hearing justice that he was now sober, that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in prison, and that he was working on becoming a better person. The defendant maintained that he had “painfully reflect[ed]” on his actions, and he expressed remorse and sorrow for them.', 'At the Rule 35 hearing, defendant maintained that the root cause of his troubles was alcoholism and that he had come to understand the pain he had caused to others. However, when he denied the motion, the hearing justice noted that defendant had not accepted responsibility for the murder of the victim. Although defendant told the court that he was “whole-heartedly grief stricken that [the victim] died as well as sincerely sorry to [the victim’s] family for [his] despicable behavior,” the hearing justice noted that defendant maintained that the victim’s death was an accident. In a letter to his probation officer before sentencing, defendant wrote, “Without any doubt in my mind, [the victim] was playing ‘Russian Roulette’ with her life, and I believe that no matter who she was with, her death was imminent.” Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 1003. Despite his arguments, the hearing justice denied Mlyniec’s motion, saying that although “the sentence is extremely harsh, the most harsh that our state can afford, the gravity of the offense is', '-3- commensurate with the harshness of the sentence given here. There is a line that protects society. The sentence is appropriate.”', 'When a trial justice imposes a sentence on a criminal defendant after trial, he considers a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment background, the potential for rehabilitation, societal deterrence, and the appropriateness of punishment. 1 See State v. Tiernan, 645 A.2d 482, 484 (R.I. 1994). A Rule 35 motion provides the trial justice with the discretion to reduce a sentence based on the notion that the “passage of time may find the sentencing judge in a more sympathetic or receptive frame of mind.” State v. Diefenderfer, 32 A.3d 931, 936 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Byrnes, 456 A.2d 742, 745 (R.I. 1983)). Here, the hearing justice gave due consideration to the trial justice’s findings, quoting them at length, but he nonetheless denied the motion, noting that “it is too late for [defendant] to change as it is too late for [the victim].” The hearing justice discussed his obligation to reflect on the appropriateness of the verdict in the “cool of the evening” when deciding whether or not to reduce defendant’s sentence. The hearing justice noted that defendant had expressed some remorse when he was sentenced, but then, as was the case at the hearing on the motion to reduce, defendant had failed to acknowledge that his actions resulted in the murder of Ms. Anderson. The hearing justice also aptly observed that this Court had affirmed Mlyniec’s sentence after conducting an independent review as we are bound to do pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19.2-5. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the motion to reduce his sentence to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. 1', 'Of note, the trial justice had retired before the motion to reduce sentence was heard. However, the justice who did hear it had the discretion to reduce defendant’s sentence after a thorough review of the record.', '-4-', 'We are “loath to interfere with a trial justice’s discretionary resolution of a Rule 35 motion * * * .” Mendoza, 958 A.2d at 1162 (quoting State v. Smith, 676 A.2d 765, 767 (R.I. 1996)). We have held that “the power [to reduce a sentence] should be exercised only when the sentence is without justification and grossly disparate from sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” State v. Giorgi, 121 R.I. 280, 282, 397 A.2d 898, 899 (1979) (emphasis added). It is our opinion that defendant has failed to direct our attention to any way in which the hearing justice abused his discretion, failed to properly consider the trial justice’s findings, or was deficient in his consideration of the arguments before him. 2', 'The hearing justice was mindful of the brutal, senseless, and horrific nature of the defendant’s crime as well as the defendant’s reluctance to bear full responsibility for the victim’s murder. In our opinion, the hearing justice exercised his discretion appropriately, and his ruling should not be disturbed.', 'Conclusion', 'The order of the Superior Court is affirmed. The papers in this case may be remanded to that tribunal.', 'Justice Indeglia did not participate. 2', 'Indeed, in his written argument to this Court, defendant seems to invite us to undertake de novo review of the arguments raised in the Superior Court.

115,(05-899-2) In re Lauren B. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The respondent, Daymon 1 Jones (respondent or Jones) appeals from a Family Court decree terminating his parental rights to his two daughters, Lauren B. (Lauren) and Stephanie B. (Stephanie). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 3, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Lauren and Stephanie first came to the attention of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) in March 2005, when their mother tested positive for cocaine upon giving 1', 'Jones’s first name alternatively appears in the record as “Daymon” and “Damon.” We refer to respondent here as “Daymon,” the name which appears on the termination petitions and on Lauren’s and Stephanie’s birth certificates.', '-1- birth to Stephanie at Newport Hospital. 2 DCYF filed neglect petitions on April 4, 2005 against both parents with respect to both Lauren and Stephanie. Both children were committed to the care and custody of DCYF.', 'On April 9, 2010, DCYF filed petitions to involuntarily terminate Jones’s 3 parental rights to Lauren and Stephanie. 4 Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a), 5 DCYF alleged the following as grounds for termination: (1) Jones’s unfitness by reason of conduct seriously detrimental to Lauren and Stephanie; (2) the children’s placement with DCYF for at least twelve months with no substantial probability that they will be able to return to Jones’s care within a reasonable 2', 'Lauren’s date of birth is May 7, 2003.

Ms. Backus subsequently consented to voluntary termination and an open adoption. At oral argument, it was suggested that Ms. Backus has withdrawn her consent. In any event, she is not a party in the instant appeal. 4', 'DCYF had filed previous petitions to terminate parental rights. Those petitions were dismissed without prejudice. Since the earlier petitions are not relevant to this appeal, we do not discuss them here. 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a) provides, in relevant part:', '“The court shall upon a petition duly filed * * * and a', 'hearing on the petition, terminate any and all legal rights of the', 'parent to the child * * * if the court finds as a fact by clear and', 'convincing evidence that:', '“* * *', '“(3) The child has been placed in the legal custody or care', 'of [DCYF] for at least twelve (12) months, and the parents were', 'offered or received services to correct the situation which led to the', 'child being placed; provided, that there is not a substantial', 'probability that the child will be able to return safely to the', 'parents’ care within a reasonable period of time considering the', 'child’s age and the need for a permanent home; or', '“(4) The parent has abandoned or deserted the child.

Over the course of four days in June and July of 2011, a trial on the termination petitions was held before a justice of the Family Court. The only witnesses to testify at trial were Timothy Cronin, on behalf of DCYF, and respondent, on his own behalf. We summarize below the relevant and sometimes conflicting testimony of both witnesses.', 'A', 'Testimony of Timothy Cronin', 'Timothy Cronin testified that he has been the DCYF social worker on Lauren and Stephanie’s case for approximately the past three years. 6 He explained that he was not assigned to the case until April 2008, about three years after it was opened. Mr. Cronin nevertheless attempted to provide some background as to Lauren and Stephanie’s history with respondent. According to Mr. Cronin, Jones was convicted in 1995 of second-degree sexual assault and received a fifteen-year suspended sentence. He testified that Jones was not incarcerated at the time of Stephanie’s birth in March 2005, 7 but was subsequently re-incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) in October 2005.', 'Mr. Cronin believed that Jones was incarcerated for most of the time between October 2005 and early 2010, except for a brief period of liberty from approximately February 2008 to April 2008. 8', 'When Mr. Cronin received the case in April 2008, Jones was permitted visitation at the ACI with Lauren and Stephanie at the discretion of DCYF. Mr. Cronin indicated, however, that 6', 'The respondent was not present in court for direct examination of Mr. Cronin. He was, however, represented by counsel at all times during the termination trial. 7', 'Later in his testimony, Mr. Cronin inconsistently stated that Jones was incarcerated at the time of Stephanie’s birth. 8', 'Mr. Cronin initially stated that Jones was released from the ACI in June 2010. He later indicated, however, that Jones’s release occurred in January 2010.', '-3- no visits were taking place based on the recommendation of a clinician from Children’s Friend and Service that Lauren and Stephanie not have contact with respondent. Pursuant to a Family Court order and a further recommendation of the clinician, Jones was later afforded one supervised visit with the children every three weeks, commencing sometime around May 2009. 9 Mr. Cronin testified that Lauren was usually willing to attend the visits with Jones. Stephanie, however, only attended “a couple” of visits because she was afraid of dogs present in the visiting room at the ACI. Mr. Cronin averred that he, the clinician, and Stephanie’s foster mother all encouraged Stephanie to attend the visits, but Stephanie refused. He acknowledged that he did not visit Jones at the ACI at any time during Jones’s incarceration.', 'Mr. Cronin explained that, in April and October of 2009, he formulated two 10 case plans aimed at reunifying Jones with Stephanie and Lauren. Under both case plans, Jones was to complete sex-offender and substance-abuse evaluations and follow any recommendations generated by those evaluations. Both case plans also specified that Jones was to refrain from discussing any DCYF issues during his visits with the children. The October 2009 plan required Jones to “[d]emonstrate the ability to resolve conflicts in a calm and civil manner.”', 'In addition, Jones was to obtain housing and maintain employment. Jones signed the April 2009 case plan but failed to sign the October 2009 plan.', 'Following Jones’s release from the ACI in January 2010, he was permitted bi-weekly visits with Lauren and Stephanie at DCYF’s offices in Bristol, Rhode Island. Mr. Cronin testified that a child-support technician from DCYF usually supervised the visits, except for one 9', 'Pursuant to a March 15, 2006 Family Court order, Jones was previously allowed visitation with Lauren but not with Stephanie. A subsequent order on October 17, 2007 permitted visitation with both children but required DCYF to monitor the effect of the visits on Stephanie. 10', 'At one point, Mr. Cronin also testified that he had developed one or more case plans with Jones upon Jones’s release from the ACI in January 2010. Copies of those plans, however, were not admitted into evidence.', '-4- visit on February 3, 2010, which he personally supervised. Mr. Cronin described the February 3 visit as having gone “fairly well.” He further testified that reports on subsequent visits from the child-support technician indicated that Jones did, “at times,” interact appropriately with Lauren and Stephanie.', 'Mr. Cronin’s staff reported that Jones always displayed affection for the children.', 'In February 2010, Jones completed the sex-offender evaluation required under the case plans.', 'That evaluation led to several recommendations for Jones, including sex-offender counseling, a polygraph examination, anger management classes, domestic violence classes, and counseling to assist him in accepting responsibility for his actions. Mr. Cronin asserted that Jones failed to follow through with these recommendations. He also asserted that Jones never completed a substance-abuse evaluation, as required under the case plans. Mr. Cronin expressly denied receiving any documentation to prove that Jones had undergone a substance-abuse evaluation. Despite Jones’s failure to comply with the case plans, he was allowed to continue his bi-weekly visits with Lauren and Stephanie. According to Mr. Cronin, the visits continued in order to demonstrate that DCYF was making reasonable efforts to reunite Jones with his children and to afford Jones every opportunity to make use of the services that DCYF was offering.', 'Mr. Cronin testified that he encouraged Jones to follow through with the case plans’ recommendations during a meeting at DCYF’s offices on February 3, 2010. According to Mr. Cronin’s recounting of the conversation, Jones reacted by insisting that “DCYF is going to do * * * things on his terms[,]” and should “grovel to him[.]” Mr. Cronin indicated that Jones had smelled of alcohol during that meeting. He also testified about two telephone conversations he had with Jones on March 11, 2010 and April 30, 2010, both of which ended with Jones’s yelling and swearing. During the latter telephone conversation, Mr. Cronin again attempted to persuade', '-5- Jones to comply with the case plans and to make use of the counseling services. Mr. Cronin stated that Jones responded to his entreaties by dismissing the services as “a waste of time.”', 'Jones’s hostility towards DCYF reached a peak on May 28, 2010. According to Mr. Cronin’s rendition of the events of that day, Jones became upset that DCYF was “brainwashing” his children after Stephanie referred to her foster parent as her “mother.” He testified that Jones then made a statement to the effect of “watch what I bring into this building[]” or “[y]ou people need to watch out for what’s going to happen[.]” Mr. Cronin interpreted Jones’s words as a threat to blow up DCYF’s offices. Lauren and Stephanie were present in the room when Jones made the alleged threats. Mr. Cronin stated that Lauren wet her bed for three consecutive nights after witnessing Jones’s outburst.', 'On June 11, 2010, DCYF filed a motion in Family Court to suspend visitation. After conducting a hearing and receiving evidence, another Family Court justice granted DCYF’s motion on August 16, 2010. A transcript of that decision was admitted into evidence at the termination trial.', 'Mr. Cronin testified that, sometime after the motion was filed, Jones telephoned Lauren and Stephanie’s foster mother, demanding to speak with the children. The foster mother refused, but Lauren overheard the argument. Mr. Cronin stated that Lauren again wet her bed for two nights following the telephone call.', 'As a result of the motion to suspend visitation, Lauren and Stephanie had not seen Jones for approximately one year at the time of trial. Mr. Cronin stated that, during that year, the children had been “great” and had done well at school.', 'He emphasized that Lauren and Stephanie have lived together with the same foster mother for most of their young lives. Mr. Cronin noted that Stephanie in particular has never had a relationship with Jones.', 'He', '-6- acknowledged that Lauren may have a “small bond” with Jones but believed that Lauren considers her foster mother to be her family.', 'B', 'The Respondent’s Testimony', 'On the third day of trial, Jones testified on his own behalf. He expressed his frustration with DCYF in general and with Mr. Cronin in particular. He asserted that, while he was incarcerated, he made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Cronin, both by letter and by telephone. According to Jones, Mr. Cronin either did not answer his telephone calls or was in too much of a rush to adequately address his concerns.', 'He also testified that he had had little to no communication with the three previous social workers assigned to his children’s case. Jones believed that DCYF had been ignoring him since the case opened.', 'Jones described his visits at the ACI with Lauren and Stephanie as “the best time that I had behind bars.” He recounted how he and the children “ran around,” “played,” and “showed love and affection for [one] another.” Jones similarly testified that, during their visits at DCYF’s offices, he and the children would “watch videos, build things, hug, [and] kiss.” In particular, he testified that he and the children, accompanied by an employee from DCYF, were allowed to walk to a nearby store. Jones stated, however, that a few of his visits were cut short because Lauren and Stephanie’s foster parent was late in bringing the children to the office. He claimed that he was never afforded an opportunity to make up the lost time with his children, despite DCYF’s promises that he would be allowed to do so.', 'Concerning the incident of May 28, 2010, Jones denied that he threatened to blow up DCYF’s offices. He claimed that his words were a threat to bring legal action against DCYF because he perceived DCYF as affording the foster family greater rights than he had with respect', '-7- to Lauren and Stephanie. Jones acknowledged that the Bristol police interviewed him about the alleged bomb threats, but he emphasized that no charges were filed. Jones also explained that in the days leading up to the incident, DCYF had refused to grant him permission to take the children to a nearby park during their next visit. He expressed his frustration with what he perceived as DCYF’s arbitrary denial of his request.', 'Contrary to Mr. Cronin’s testimony, Jones insisted that he had completed the substance- abuse evaluation required by the case plans. He specifically testified that he had undergone an evaluation at CODAC Behavioral Healthcare in Newport, Rhode Island. According to Jones, that evaluation indicated that he was not in need of substance-abuse counseling. With regard to his sex-offender evaluation, he asserted that the individual who conducted the evaluation was “nothing more than another agent for DCYF.” Jones therefore demanded an “independent” evaluation. He expressed his disagreement with the evaluator’s recommendation that he undergo sex-offender counseling. According to Jones, he was never required to complete counseling as a result of his 1995 conviction of second-degree sexual assault. 11', 'He maintained that he is innocent of the 1995 sexual assault and indicated that he has an application for postconviction relief pending in Providence Superior Court. Jones testified that he had participated in domestic violence counseling while at the ACI.', 'Jones admitted that he did not meet Stephanie for the first time until she was three-years old. Lauren, however, had lived with him and his aunt prior to her being taken into DCYF’s 11', 'Jones’s testimony about his criminal history was somewhat confused. Consistent with Mr. Cronin’s testimony, Jones explained that he had received a fifteen-year suspended sentence as a result of the 1995 conviction. He also indicated that he had received a suspended sentence for a separate “B & E,” or breaking and entering, conviction. Jones then attempted to explain that “[t]he only time I went back to jail was a violation of that suspended sentence.” He did not, however, indicate to which period of re-incarceration or to which suspended sentence he was referring. Jones also testified that his release in January 2010 was on bail pending appeal.', '-8- custody.', 'Jones emphasized that he was capable of being a caring parent to Lauren and Stephanie. He described himself as a “family oriented person” who has already raised two adult children. 12 Jones expressed his concern that Lauren and Stephanie, who are African-American, might be raised by an Hispanic foster family.', 'On November 16, 2011, the trial justice issued a thorough forty-six-page written decision. In that decision, the trial justice reviewed the testimony and exhibits presented at trial. She adopted and incorporated by reference the findings made by the Family Court justice in the August 16, 2010 bench decision that granted DCYF’s motion to suspend visitation. The trial justice then went on to find that Jones’s “lack of cooperation with his sex offender recommendations, substance abuse evaluation, and anger management issues and his failure to respond to DCYF’s efforts for almost six (6) years renders [sic] him unfit to parent Lauren and Stephanie.” She noted that respondent “has done little towards reunifying with his daughters except show up for his limited, supervised visits.” The trial justice further found that there was “ample evidence * * * that DCYF made more than reasonable efforts to reunify the family” but that respondent had “set up barriers to reunification[.]” She therefore concluded that DCYF had met its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the children had been in the care of DCYF for at least twelve months, respondent was offered services to correct the situation that led to the children’s being placed in care, and there was no substantial probability that the children could safely return to respondent’s care within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the trial justice concluded that respondent had “abandoned or deserted the children by failing to comply with the terms of the supervised visitation[] and that his inability to comply with DCYF had led [the Family Court] to suspend his visitation * * * on August 16, 2010.” 12', 'Jones testified that he has a daughter, aged twenty, with whom he was residing at the time of trial. He also stated that he has an eighteen-year-old son.', '-9-', 'Finally, the trial justice found that it is in Lauren’s and Stephanie’s best interests to terminate respondent’s parental rights. She noted that “[b]oth Lauren and Stephanie are thriving in the only home Stephanie has known since birth,” and “both are bonded to the foster family.” 13 Accordingly, the trial justice granted DCYF’s petitions to terminate Jones’s parental rights to Lauren and Stephanie pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii), (a)(2)(vii), and (a)(3).', 'A decree terminating respondent’s parental rights entered on December 7, 2011.

Section 15-7-7(b)(1) is silent on whether the “reasonable efforts” requirement applies to terminations under § 15-7-7(a)(3).', '- 12 - offered Jones “a myriad of services, all of which were within * * * Jones’[s] grasp,” but Jones “chose not to avail himself of those services[.]” Our review of the record shows that there is ample evidentiary support for the trial justice’s findings.', 'Mr. Cronin testified that he had prepared at least two case plans with the goal of reunifying Jones with his children. See In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d at 882 (reasonable efforts require DCYF to develop a plan to provide appropriate services to family).', 'Those plans, admitted into evidence at trial, contained a number of requirements that Jones failed to complete, including sex-offender counseling, anger management classes, a substance-abuse evaluation, and other therapy to assist Jones in taking responsibility for his treatment needs. 15 Given that Jones’s criminal history, including a conviction for sexual assault, and his incarceration were the primary reasons he lost custody of the children, the services offered were patently targeted to address the reasons that Lauren and Stephanie were placed into care.', 'Mr. Cronin tried to encourage Jones to take advantage of the proffered services on more than one occasion. His urging, however, was repeatedly met with Jones’s fits of temper and outbursts of abusive language. Indeed, during his testimony, Jones acknowledged that he yelled and swore at Mr. Cronin. Mr. Cronin further testified that Jones accused the evaluator of bias, insisted that the services were a “waste of time,” and expressed his determination to make DCYF “do * * * things on his terms.” Considering respondent’s recalcitrance and DCYF’s persistence, we do not believe the trial justice erred in finding that DCYF had proved by clear and convincing evidence that it made reasonable efforts to correct the situation that led to Lauren and Stephanie being placed into care. 15', 'We acknowledge that respondent completed domestic violence counseling.', '- 13 -', 'In addition, the record reflects that DCYF made reasonable efforts to provide Jones with visits with Lauren and Stephanie. See In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d at 882 (reasonable efforts include “‘suitable arrangements for visitation’”). The sex-offender evaluation recommended that a meeting to discuss the appropriateness of visits should be held only after Jones completed the necessary counseling. Nonetheless, the record shows that, despite Jones’s failure to cooperate with the case plan, DCYF continued to provide Jones with visitation up until the incident on May 28, 2010 prompted DCYF to move to suspend visitation. 16', 'The respondent suggests that DCYF fabricated the threats of May 28, 2010 to manufacture an excuse to further isolate him from his children. We can find no support in the record for respondent’s suggestion. The transcript of the August 16, 2010 bench decision granting DCYF’s motion to suspend visitation, admitted into evidence at trial, indicates that “[t]he motion * * * has been filed as a result of the father’s accumulated actions over the past several months, as well as the reaction of Lauren and the interactions between * * * Mr. Cronin[] and the father, and * * * most importantly[,] the father’s noncompliance with the service plan, which may * * * have assisted him in learning how to control his anger.” In light of this evidence, we must disagree with Jones’s assertion that the “reasonable efforts” requirement obligated DCYF to continue visitation. We certainly cannot agree that “reasonable efforts” required DCYF to increase visitation. See In re Amber P., 877 A.2d 608, 619 (R.I. 2005) (DCYF was under no obligation to provide visits after a Family Court order denied visitation and father failed to appeal from order); cf. In re Diamond Y., 915 A.2d at 1289 (in light of father’s 16', 'Under § 15-7-7(b)(2), DCYF’s obligation to make reasonable efforts ceases once a termination petition is filed. The filing of a termination petition, however, does not limit the parent’s right to visit the child while the petition is pending. See id. The relevant termination petitions in this case were filed on April 9, 2010, prior to DCYF’s filing its motion to suspend on June 11, 2010.', '- 14 - failure to comply with case plans, any shortcoming of social worker in arranging visitation did not render DCYF’s efforts inadequate).', '2', 'Substantial Possibility of Safe Return to Parent’s Care', 'The respondent also contends that the evidence failed to establish that Lauren and Stephanie could not have safely returned to his care within a reasonable period of time. The respondent argues that his incarceration caused the children to come into DCYF’s care and suggests that, upon his release, there were no further obstacles to reunification.', 'The April and October 2009 case plans identified several areas of risk that respondent needed to address before the children could safely return to his care. Those areas included risks of substance abuse and sexual offense, as well as a history of violence and criminal behavior. As discussed supra, the case plans and the sex-offender evaluation contained a number of required treatments that respondent failed to complete. Jones’s unwillingness to accept the help that DCYF was offering clearly jeopardized Lauren and Stephanie’s safe return to his care. In re Michael F., 665 A.2d 880, 882 (R.I. 1995) (a parent’s “unwillingness to accept help clearly places [the child] at risk of emotional and physical harm”).', 'Jones contends, however, that his failure to comply with the recommendations of the sex- offender evaluation was not a barrier to reunification because the recommended treatment was unnecessary. The respondent points out that he was never required to undergo sex-offender counseling as a condition of his probation and he has not re-offended in the sixteen years since his conviction.', 'He further claims that the evaluator’s lack of impartiality undermines the authority of the recommendations.', '- 15 -', 'A parent’s self-assessment that he or she poses no risk of sexual harm to his or her child is not an adequate assurance that the child may safely return to the parent’s care. See In re Raymond C., 751 A.2d 281, 283 (R.I. 2000) (upholding trial justice’s finding that mother’s denial of risk of sexual abuse made reunification problematic). Irrespective of whether sex- offender treatment was required as a condition of Jones’s probation, DCYF determined that compliance with a sex-offender evaluation was necessary to ensure that Lauren and Stephanie could safely return to respondent’s custody. “When the welfare of a child is concerned, [DCYF] and the [Family] [C]ourt have the duty to request compliance with services offered and the completion of programs to be certain that respondent[] ha[s], in fact, addressed [his] problems.” In re Michael F., 665 A.2d at 882. The evidence at trial unequivocally demonstrated that Jones had no intention of following through with the recommended treatments. Faced with such evidence, we decline to find any error on the part of the trial justice in determining that respondent’s failure to complete the recommendations of the sex-offender evaluation made a safe reunification unlikely. See In re Julian D., 18 A.3d at 485 (“Given [father’s] continued refusal to participate in sexual-offender treatment and the requirement that completing DCYF’s case-plan goals was a precondition of reunification, we find no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that Julian would be unable to return to [father] any time soon.”).', 'The respondent next argues that substance abuse was not an obstacle to reunification because he completed an evaluation which indicated that he was not in need of counseling. Contrary to respondent’s assertion, Mr. Cronin testified that he never received any proof that respondent had undergone the required substance-abuse evaluation. The trial justice apparently chose to credit Mr. Cronin’s testimony because she found that Jones had failed to comply with the case plan’s requirement of cooperating with and completing a substance-abuse evaluation. In', '- 16 - light of Jones’s failure to submit any documentary evidence to rebut Mr. Cronin’s testimony, we cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong in finding that Jones had failed to address the issue of substance abuse. See In re Daniel D., 9 A.3d at 656 (noting that it was trial justice’s “prerogative to find [the social worker’s] version of events more credible than [father]’s”).', 'We further note that both the trial justice and the Family Court justice who granted DCYF’s motion to suspend visitation expressed particular concern about respondent’s inability to control his anger and self-regulate his behavior. The trial justice specifically found that respondent had failed to demonstrate that he was capable of resolving conflicts in a calm and civil manner, as required under the October 2009 case plan. She emphasized that respondent “chose to deny his anger and violence issues and instead blame others or diminish its impact on his ability to care for his children.” In fact, the record shows that anger management counseling was one of the recommended treatments that Jones failed to complete. The evidence of Jones’s vehement hostility towards Mr. Cronin and his threats on May 28, 2010 in front of the children further demonstrate that Jones’s uncontrolled anger was an obstacle to the children’s safe return to his care.', 'Based on the above evidence, 17 we discern no error in the trial justice’s finding that there was no substantial probability of Lauren and Stephanie safely returning to respondent’s care within a reasonable period of time. In sum, we are satisfied that the record supports the trial justice’s findings that the elements of § 15-7-7(a)(3) were proven by clear and convincing evidence. 17', 'Jones was also required to secure employment prior to regaining care of Lauren and Stephanie. Although Jones testified that he was employed at the time of trial, Mr. Cronin testified that he never received any proof of employment from Jones in the months preceding the filing of the termination petitions.', '- 17 -', 'B', 'Abandonment under § 15-7-7(a)(4)', 'In her written decision, the trial justice wrote that she was terminating respondent’s parental rights pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii), § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii), and § 15-7-7(a)(3). The parties assume, however, that the trial justice’s decision was based on a finding of unfitness under § 15- 7-7(a)(3) and a finding of abandonment under § 15-7-7(a)(4). The respondent argues that there was insufficient proof to support the trial justice’s finding of abandonment under § 15-7-7(a)(4).', 'In the formal “Termination of Parental Rights Decree,” the trial justice made findings and used statutory language indicating that termination was based on both § 15-7-7(a)(3) and § 15-7- 7(a)(4). See In re Julian D., 18 A.3d at 482 (holding that termination decree recounted oral findings and used statutory terminology sufficient to establish statutory grounds upon which trial justice based termination). Nonetheless, we need not determine the additional grounds upon which the trial justice based her decision. Clear and convincing proof of any one of the statutory grounds in § 15-7-7(a) suffices to grant a petition to terminate parental rights. In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 86 (R.I. 2006) (citing § 15-7-7(a)). Since we uphold the trial justice’s decision to terminate the respondent’s parental rights under § 15-7-7(a)(3), we need not address the respondent’s argument that the trial justice erred in finding that DCYF had met its burden of proving abandonment under § 15-7-7(a)(4). See In re Julian D., 18 A.3d at 486 (“Because this Court holds that the trial justice articulated a proper basis for the termination of [the father’s] rights in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(3), we need not examine [the father’s] assignments of error with respect to * * * § 15-7-7(a)(4), abandonment.” (citing In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d at 86)).', '- 18 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court terminating the respondent’s parental rights.

116,Anthony Perkins : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Anthony Perkins’s application for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel was denied in the Superior Court, and he appealed to this Court, contending that the trial justice’s decision was in error. This case came before the Supreme Court on October 2, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 15, 1999, applicant, Anthony Perkins, entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of first-degree robbery and was sentenced to twenty years with nine years to serve and eleven years suspended, with probation. While he was on parole from that sentence, applicant was charged with second-degree child molestation. Of relevance to this appeal, the acts on', '-1- which the child-molestation charges were based occurred before applicant was convicted of robbery.', 'On July 25, 2003, applicant pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of second-degree child molestation. Under the terms of a plea agreement, he received a ten-year suspended sentence with ten years probation, both of which would run concurrently with his ongoing sentence on the robbery conviction. Perkins was also required to register as a sex offender and to undergo sex-offender treatment counseling as determined by the probation department.', 'On September 14, 2006, Perkins filed an application for postconviction relief. In that application, he alleged that the attorney who had represented him in the child-molestation case had provided him with ineffective assistance. The applicant alleged that his former attorney advised him that if he had not pleaded to the child-molestation charges, the state would have sought to revoke his probation stemming from the robbery conviction. He further alleged that his counsel told him that the state would then seek the revocation of his suspended sentence and that he would be incarcerated for eleven years, starting immediately. Perkins said that this advice was erroneous because he could not have been found to have violated the terms of his probation based on conduct that occurred before he was on probation. The erroneous advice, applicant claimed, denied him the effective assistance of counsel.', 'The same Superior Court justice who accepted applicant’s nolo contendere plea to the child-molestation charges held a hearing on applicant’s postconviction-relief application. In his decision denying the application, the trial justice said that applicant had presented no evidence that his former attorney gave him erroneous advice except for applicant’s own “self-serving statements and allegations” and that, even if he had been provided with erroneous advice, applicant nonetheless had failed to demonstrate that the result of the earlier proceedings would', '-2- have been different. As a result, the trial justice denied the application, and Perkins timely appealed to this Court.', 'On appeal, applicant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because of his former attorney’s guidance that, if he did not plead guilty to the child-molestation charges, then the state would have sought to revoke his probation. He also argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied the application in the face of applicant’s uncontroverted testimony during the postconviction-relief hearing.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Postconviction relief is available pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1), which provides a remedy to a person who has been convicted of a crime and who demonstrates “[t]hat the conviction or the sentence was in violation of the constitution of the United States or the constitution or laws of this state[.]” See also Hazard v. State, 64 A.3d 749, 756 (R.I. 2013). An applicant for postconviction relief must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the relief should be granted. Id.', 'On appeal, “this Court affords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact and will not disturb his or her ruling ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756 (quoting Higham v. State, 45 A.3d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 2012)).', '“When a postconviction relief decision involves ‘questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights[,]’ we review those issues de novo.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011).', '-3-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'When we evaluate a postconviction-relief application based on an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court employs the well-known standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756. Under that exacting standard, applicants must demonstrate both that “counsel’s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” and that “such deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Id. (quoting Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 1284-85 (R.I. 2012)).', 'The first prong of the Strickland analysis requires an applicant to show “that counsel’s performance was deficient[, which] requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610 (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 522 (R.I. 1999)). To overcome this obstacle, there must be a showing that “‘counsel’s advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases * * * .’” Id. (quoting Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 2009)). There is, however, “a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.” Id. (citing Hazard v. State, 968 A.2d 886, 892 (R.I. 2009)).', 'The Strickland test’s second prong is satisfied by a showing of prejudice resulting from counsel’s deficient performance. Hazard, 64 A.3d at 757. In this context, prejudice is defined as “‘a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different[,]’” id., which, in a plea context, means that the applicant', '-4- “‘would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial’ and, importantly, that the outcome of the trial would have been different.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 611 (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)). Notably, we have said that “when counsel has secured a shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had he gone to trial, the [applicant] has an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice.” Id. at 614 (citing Rodrigues, 985 A.3d at 317).', 'In Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 500, we considered the misrepresentations by counsel to a defendant who had pleaded nolo contendere. There, there was no question that the defendant had been given erroneous advice by his attorney: he was told that his nolo contendere plea was not a conviction under Rhode Island law and that the Spanish-language plea form was identical to the English-language form. Id. We held that “[a]lthough th[e] misrepresentations may have fallen below acceptable standards of attorney performance, [the applicant] did not satisfactorily prove that the outcome would have been different if he had proceeded to trial.” Id. Because the applicant admitted that he committed the gun offense for which he was charged, we said that a trial likely would have resulted in a conviction and sentence of imprisonment. Id. at 500-01.', 'In the case presently before us, the trial justice determined that applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had received the advice that he claims was constitutionally deficient. In his decision, the trial justice recounted that applicant had failed to directly answer questions about whether he had been advised to lie during the plea colloquy and that he also had testified inconsistently about how much he and his attorney had discussed the potential plea. The trial justice also observed that applicant was attempting to persuade the trial justice that he had lied during the plea colloquy but that he was testifying truthfully at the postconviction-relief hearing. Because the trial justice determined that applicant had failed to submit “a scintilla of evidence”', '-5- beyond his own “self-serving statements and allegations,” and because those statements and allegations had failed to persuade him, the trial justice denied the application. 1', 'Although applicant argues to this Court that the advice that probation could be revoked based on conduct that predated the probation would amount to a legal impossibility, and therefore was clearly deficient, he is unable to articulate why we should reject the trial justice’s finding that applicant did not receive that advice from his attorney. See Pelletier v. Laureanno, 46 A.3d 28, 39 (R.I. 2012) (viewing with deference a trial justice’s decision to reject uncontroverted testimony of a party to the litigation and interested witness because he found that it was “not credible,” “self-serving,” and “biased”). Indeed, the trial justice concluded that the advice would have been erroneous if it had been given, but he also found that applicant had failed to satisfy his burden that the advice was in fact given. 2 We cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material evidence when he found that applicant failed to satisfy his burden. See Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756.', 'We are also of the opinion that, even if he had somehow been able to satisfy the first prong of the Strickland analysis, applicant has failed to show that prejudice resulted from any erroneous advice that he may have received. See Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610-11, 614. Other than his own conclusion that he would have been acquitted, Perkins failed to provide any reason why the outcome of a trial would have been more favorable to him than was his disposition. See id. 1', 'The attorney who represented applicant in the child-molestation information and subsequent plea to that charge was not called to testify during the postconviction-relief proceedings. 2', 'Although the determination is not necessary to decide this case, we agree with the trial justice that such advice would have been erroneous. In State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1158-59 (R.I. 2005) (mem.), we considered “[t]he notion of a defendant being on probation with respect to a criminal offense before being convicted of the crime itself * * * .” We held that it “defies common sense,” “is not legally viable,” and “quite apart from being illogical, is rife with practical problems,” such as the fact that a person could be violated before he or she was sentenced to the probation. Id. at 1158, 1159.', '-6- Indeed, there is nothing on which this Court could base a conclusion that a different outcome would have resulted from a trial. See Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 500-01 (noting the absence of anything that might show an applicant’s innocence and concluding that a trial “most probabl[y]” would have led to a conviction).', 'In Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614, we said that the burden of showing prejudice is “almost insurmountable” when the sentence received after a plea is shorter than the sentence that an applicant could have received had he proceeded to trial. The applicant here was charged with second-degree child molestation under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3. Pursuant to § 11-37-8.4, the applicant could have been sentenced to between six and thirty years for each count if he was convicted after trial, and those sentences could have been imposed consecutively and even consecutive to the robbery sentence he was already serving. See State v. Fuentes, 433 A.2d 184, 192 (R.I. 1981). By striking a favorable agreement with the state and pleading nolo contendere, he received only a ten-year sentence, all of which was suspended and ran concurrently with his robbery sentence.', 'The applicant has failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice whatsoever from the advice that he contends he received, and his application thus falls short on the Strickland test’s second prong as well.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff, Peter Wyso, appeals from summary judgment entered against him and in favor of a tenant and property owner in a personal injury action. Wyso contended that he sustained injuries when he tripped and fell on a public sidewalk that was uneven and replete with cracks. On October 2, 2013, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the plaintiff to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not summarily be decided.

The plaintiff contended that he suffered injuries as a result of the fall. The property that abuts the sidewalk at 104 Water Street is owned by Frederick and Deborah Howarth (the Howarths) and was leased to retailers Full Moon Tide, LLC and Strings & Things, Inc. (Full Moon Tide). 2', 'The plaintiff filed suit in Washington County Superior Court on September 1, 2010, alleging that defendants’ negligence was the proximate cause of his injuries. The complaint alleged that defendants “negligently failed to inspect, repair, and/or maintain its premises free from defect and/or dangerous condition causing plaintiff to fall and suffer injuries * * * .” It is significant that Wyso did not allege that defendants were responsible for creating or causing the defects in the sidewalk. On November 14, 2011, Full Moon Tide filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. On January 5, 2012, plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint, alleging in that proposed amendment that, in addition to the negligence claim, defendants owed plaintiff a duty to warn of the dangerous condition of the sidewalk.', 'On January 17, 2012, the trial justice granted Full Moon Tide’s motion for summary judgment.

The complaint was amended, at least with respect to the Howarths, to include a duty to warn him of the condition of the sidewalk.

However, in our opinion, he overlooked a significant amount of our jurisprudence providing that a property owner owes no duty to individuals for the condition of public sidewalks when the property owner has taken no action to create the dangerous condition. See Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1047 (R.I. 2010) (“It is a well-established legal principle in this jurisdiction, as well as others, that a landowner whose property abuts a public way has no duty to repair or maintain it.”).', 'In Saunders v.

Id. at 31, 371 A.2d at 274.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that a duty should be recognized because this Court has taken an ad hoc approach to determine a duty. In Banks, we established a five-factor approach that considers all relevant circumstances, including foreseeability of harm, closeness of connection between a defendant’s conduct and a plaintiff’s injury, and the consequences of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach of the duty. Bucki v. Hawkins, 914 A.2d 491, 495 (R.I. 2007) (citing Banks, 522 A.2d at 1225).', 'However, we believe that plaintiff’s reliance on Banks is misplaced for two reasons. First, we have cautioned that the factors in Banks were “case specific and should not be taken or construed to limit the scope of factors that we shall consider in future cases involving different factual situations.” Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 685 n.2 (R.I. 1994). In Ferreira, which involved a claim of a property owner’s duty of care to pedestrians on a public highway, we considered factors that differed from those outlined in Banks because the public highway was not owned, possessed, or controlled by the defendants. Id. We concluded in Ferreira that the', '-5- defendants owed no duty of care to the plaintiffs because the injuries that were claimed occurred in an area that was beyond the property owner’s control. Id. at 685.', ""Second, Banks was a premises-liability negligence claim against property owners that was lodged by an invitee who was on the landowner’s property at the time of the injury. See Banks, 522 A.2d at 1223-24. A property owner owes a duty of care to those whom he can reasonably expect to be on his property. O’Brien v. State, 555 A.2d 334, 338 (R.I. 1989). The rationale for the imposition of this duty rests firmly on the landowner's possession of the premises and his or her attendant right and obligation to control the premises. Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 685. Here, however, plaintiff’s injuries occurred on a public sidewalk that was not within defendants’ control or possession."", 'Undaunted, plaintiff next argues that the source of defendants’ duty of care arises from Section 15(a) of the Town of New Shoreham Ordinances, which addresses maintenance and repair of sidewalks. 5 In our opinion, this analysis also is misplaced because we have decided previously that a municipal ordinance does not create a duty to maintain a public sidewalk for individual passers-by. Gillikin v. Metro Properties, Inc., 657 A.2d 1060, 1061 (R.I. 1995); see also Arenas v. Riveredge Village Associates, 688 A.2d 858, 858 (R.I. 1997) (mem.).

Indeed, the ordinance cited by plaintiff goes even further than the ordinance at issue in Martin, because it states explicitly that a property owner who fails to keep a public sidewalk in good order and repair “shall be liable to the town” for losses or recoveries.', 'The plaintiff next argues that the defendants owed him a duty to warn of the condition of a defective sidewalk. 6 This argument also falls short because a property owner who owes no duty of care to an individual also owes no duty to warn those individuals.

State Department of Transportation, 764 A.2d 725, 727 (R.I. 2001).

118,Eddie M. Linde : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on September 25, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. This application for postconviction relief is Eddie M. Linde’s (Linde or applicant) third attempt to persuade this Court to either vacate his convictions for second-degree murder and related firearms offenses or vacate the mandatory consecutive life sentence that was imposed for the use of a firearm in the commission of a homicide. In this postconviction relief appeal, the applicant contends that (1) the mandatory consecutive life sentence imposed under G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2 for discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution; (2) the conviction and sentence for second-degree murder and discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and article 1, section 7 of the Rhode Island Constitution; (3) trial counsel was ineffective because (a) when moving to suppress statements made to the police, he failed to argue that the applicant was so intoxicated that he was incapable of knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily waiving his', '-1- right to remain silent; and (b) he failed to present a manslaughter defense based on diminished capacity at the plea bargaining stage and, again, at trial.', 'After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and considering the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the trial justice’s denial of postconviction relief.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case were set forth in significant detail in this Court’s decision denying defendant’s direct appeal. See State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115 (R.I. 2005) (Linde I); see also State v. Linde, 965 A.2d 415 (R.I. 2009) (Linde II) (holding that defendant’s constitutional claims could not be brought under a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure). We therefore only briefly describe the events leading to this senseless killing.', 'In 2002, applicant was convicted of nine felony counts, including second-degree murder, for killing his co-worker with a handgun in the parking lot of a motel. Linde I, 876 A.2d at 1118. Although there was evidence that applicant had consumed a significant amount of alcohol on the night of the shooting, the defense raised at trial was accident. Id. at 1120-21, 1129. The applicant was sentenced to forty years imprisonment, twenty years to serve, for second-degree murder and to a mandatory term of life imprisonment for discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death, consecutive to the sentence for second-degree murder. Id. at 1118 n.1. In 2006, applicant successfully moved to reduce the prison time for second-degree murder to ten years to serve. Next, he sought to challenge his sentence on constitutional grounds under Rule 35. Linde II, 965 A.2d at 416. This Court, however, held that constitutional claims were not cognizable under Rule 35. Linde II, 965 A.2d at 417.', '-2-', 'In this application for postconviction relief, applicant again asserted his constitutional claims and also raised ineffective assistance of counsel as grounds for vacating his conviction. An evidentiary hearing was held in January 2012 before a justice of the Superior Court, who also had been the trial justice. In addition to documentary evidence, Alan Feinstein (Feinstein), a forensic mental health consultant, offered expert testimony on applicant’s behalf.', 'The applicant’s trial counsel was called to testify by the state. Feinstein reviewed trial transcripts, witness statements, police reports, and a psychological evaluation of applicant that was prepared a few months after trial. Based on his review of those materials and multiple interviews with applicant, Feinstein concluded that applicant’s level of intoxication before, during, and after the events that resulted in the death of his co-worker completely paralyzed applicant’s will and deprived him of the power to withstand evil impulses, rendering his mind incapable of forming any sane design. Feinstein also opined that at the time he was interrogated, applicant was so intoxicated that he was unable to provide a police statement with rational intellect and free will. Additionally, Feinstein concluded that applicant does not have “any real recollection” of the events culminating in the death of his co-worker.', 'The applicant’s trial counsel testified that Linde’s drug and alcohol use on the night of the murder was a serious issue that he carefully considered in formulating a defense. However, his client insisted repeatedly that he was not so drunk that he could not remember what happened and consistently maintained that the shooting was an accident. Trial counsel also testified that he advised applicant about a potential defense of diminished capacity, but applicant rejected his advice. Additionally, trial counsel advised applicant to refrain from testifying unless he had a good memory of the events. Furthermore, trial counsel testified that he did not receive a plea', '-3- offer from the state nor did he solicit an offer because applicant “wanted to go home and wanted complete exoneration.”1', 'With respect to the motion to suppress his police statements, trial counsel testified that he did not think he could establish that applicant was so intoxicated as to suffer diminished capacity. It also was his belief that suppression would have been futile because Linde testified at trial, and the statements would be available to impeach his credibility if he gave inconsistent testimony. Finally, the trial justice asked trial counsel if, even in hindsight, he could “in any way have presented a defense of diminished capacity contemporaneously with the defense of accident that your client insisted on?” Trial counsel answered “no.”', 'The trial justice issued a bench decision and denied all relief. First, he disposed of applicant’s constitutional challenges to the statute premised on the separation of powers, due process, the Eighth Amendment, and double jeopardy by stating that those issues previously had been decided by this Court. Next, the trial justice found that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain a plea offer from the state in order to dispose of the case without a trial—first, because the state made no such offer and, second, because applicant sought complete exoneration.', 'Finally, the trial justice addressed the defense of diminished capacity.', 'As to the suppression issue, he found that the statements applicant made to the police were voluntary and reflected a “deliberateness and cunning” through which Linde “tried to shift blame or extricate himself.” The trial justice also declared that the suppression ruling was of no consequence because applicant testified at trial and the state presented eyewitness testimony against him. 1', 'The applicant was an ironworker from Florida; he was recruited to come to Rhode Island to work on the Ocean State Baptist Church in Smithfield. State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1118-19 (R.I. 2005). A six-man crew of ironworkers stayed in three rooms at the Susse Chalet motel in Smithfield. Id. at 1119. Only four went home.', '-4- Addressing trial counsel’s failure to present a defense of diminished capacity, the trial justice found that “[n]ot presenting a diminished capacity defense was a very sensible tactical decision by experienced trial counsel,” noting the logical incompatibility of the defense of accident juxtaposed with a plea of diminished capacity.', 'Standard of Review', '“The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1 is ‘available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.’” Hall v.

(quoting Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605 (R.I. 2011)). “When a postconviction relief decision involves ‘questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights[,]’ we review those issues de novo.” Neufville v.

State, 968 A.2d 886, 891 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Cruel and Unusual Punishment', 'The applicant contends that the mandatory life sentence imposed under § 11-47-3.2 violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution.2 This Court has previously declared that a mandatory consecutive life sentence imposed under § 11-47-3.2 survives a constitutional challenge.', 'See State v. 2', 'These two provisions “are identical.” State v. Ouimette, 479 A.2d 702, 706 (R.I. 1984); see also McKinney v. State, 843 A.2d 463, 470 (R.I. 2004) (reaffirming).', '-5- Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 795-96 (R.I. 2007) (rejecting the defendant’s contention that consecutive life sentences imposed for first-degree murder and discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death constitute cruel and unusual punishment). The applicant’s argument that Monteiro is distinguishable because the defendant in Monteiro was convicted of first-degree murder—whereas applicant was convicted of second-degree murder— is unavailing. The holding in Monteiro did not rise and fall with the classification of murder, but rather with the fact that the defendant was convicted of murder and used a firearm. See id.; see also State v. Martinez, 59 A.3d 73, 88-89 (R.I. 2013) (noting that the only difference between first-degree and second-degree murder is the duration of premeditation). When this Court concluded that the Legislature had the authority to mandate “consecutive sentences for murder and using a firearm while committing that murder,” we did not distinguish between first-degree and second-degree murder; we decline to draw such a distinction in this case. Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 794.', 'The applicant places significant emphasis on State v. Ballard, 699 A.2d 14, 17 (R.I. 1997), a case of dubious authority in which the Court concluded that consecutive life sentences—imposed in the discretion of the trial justice—were “unjustifiably out of proportion to the severity of [the defendant’s] crimes.”3 In Monteiro, however, this Court held that Ballard “is of no assistance in evaluating the constitutionality of mandatory consecutive sentences.” Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 794. Because this case involves a mandatory consecutive life sentence, Ballard is irrelevant to our analysis. 3', 'The defendant in Ballard was convicted of “conspiracy to kidnap with intent to extort, two counts of kidnapping with intent to extort, kidnapping, carrying a pistol without a license, and three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon.” State v. Ballard, 699 A.2d 14, 14 (R.I. 1997).', '-6-', 'Finally, applicant attempts to fashion an argument of gross disproportionality under our holding in McKinney v. State, 843 A.2d 463 (R.I. 2004). In McKinney, the Court recognized a narrow proportionality principle, holding that “a sentence is disproportionate under either the Rhode Island Constitution or the United States Constitution if the sentence itself is unduly harsh when compared with the crime.” Id. at 470. While “[t]here are many factors to consider when evaluating the gravity of a defendant’s offense[,]” the Court’s nonexhaustive list of factors included “the nature of the crime, the defendant’s criminal history, the state legislature’s intent when it classified the crime, and the state’s public safety interest in incapacitating recidivists.” Id.', 'We applied the McKinney test in Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 795-96. We held that the defendant’s consecutive life sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in circumstances of a gang-related shooting death of an innocent bystander.', 'Id.', 'The Court concluded that the facts in that case were “precisely the type of gun violence that the Legislature intended to address when it provided for a mandatory consecutive sentence of life imprisonment for using a firearm while committing murder.” Id. at 795. The Court also noted that life imprisonment “is not the harshest punishment under our law,” but rather that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is the harshest. Id.', 'In this case, although not a gang-related murder, we are nonetheless confronted with yet another tragic incident of gun violence, the very crime the Legislature sought to curtail when it enacted this statutory scheme. The fatal shooting in this case carried over from an earlier altercation. See Linde I, 876 A.2d at 1119-20 (describing weaponless scuffle between applicant and co-worker Mosley, resulting in applicant leaving work for the day due to injury). Although applicant offered three different versions of the events, each with a different explanation for how', '-7- he ended up in the parking lot with the gun when his co-workers returned from work, it is clear that applicant “instigated the confrontation by stepping into the parking lot carrying a loaded weapon * * *.” Id. at 1131. As a result of inciting a second confrontation and introducing a gun into the dispute, applicant killed his co-worker, Randy Silas, whose only involvement in the dispute was that he was in the line of fire.', 'Finally, to the extent that applicant contended at oral argument that the mandatory life sentence is disproportionate to the ten-year term imposed after the sentence was reduced for second-degree murder, that argument distorts the inquiry. First, the test is whether “the sentence itself is unduly harsh when compared with the crime,” not whether it is disproportionate to the sentence imposed for a different conviction in the same indictment. McKinney, 843 A.2d at 470. The mandatory life sentence was imposed for discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death.', 'Also, applicant was sentenced to forty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions for second-degree murder, with twenty years to serve. The largess of the trial justice who reduced the sentence to ten years to serve does not give rise to any constitutional infirmity in connection with the mandatory consecutive life sentence for the firearm offense.', 'Therefore, we are satisfied that the mandatory consecutive life sentence for discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death is not unconstitutional.', 'Double Jeopardy', 'The applicant contends that judgments of conviction and sentences for the dual offenses of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence and second-degree murder (the crime of violence) violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and article 1, section 7 of the Rhode Island Constitution. “This Court long has held that ‘[b]ecause of', '-8- the similar wording and purpose underlying the state and federal constitutional provisions on this subject, Rhode Island cases have hewed closely to federal double-jeopardy law when applying the analogous clause in the Rhode Island Constitution.’” State v. Marsich, 10 A.3d 435, 442 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 906 (R.I. 2003)). The Double Jeopardy Clause protects “a criminal defendant from multiple trials for the same offense * * * and prohibits a sentencing court from imposing greater punishment than the legislature has proscribed.” Id. (citing Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 366 (1983)). Recently, in Marsich, this Court summarized the two double-jeopardy tests:', '“The determination of whether a defendant is placed in', 'double jeopardy can be made in one of two ways. The first method', 'is the ‘same evidence’ test set forth in Blockburger v. United', 'States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), and', 'adopted by this Court almost forty years ago. * * * Under this', 'analysis, ‘where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation', 'of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to', 'determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether', 'each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.’', '***', '“The second manner in which an alleged double jeopardy', 'violation is analyzed is the test first established in Hunter, 459 U.S.', 'at 365-66 * * * and subsequently adopted by this Court. * * * This', 'analysis requires the Court to ‘examine the challenged statutes to', 'ascertain whether the Legislature intended to authorize cumulative', 'sentencing’ for the offenses contained in the indictment. * * * If', 'the legislative intent underlying the enactment is clear, consecutive', 'sentences upon conviction under both statutes does not offend', 'principles of double jeopardy, ‘regardless of whether both statutes', 'proscribe the same conduct under Blockburger.’” Marsich, 10', 'A.3d at 442.', 'Here, applicant’s double jeopardy argument fails both tests. In Rodriguez, 822 A.2d at 906, the defendant was accused of both first-degree murder and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence. The Court held that the trial court’s imposition of consecutive life sentences did not violate either federal or state double jeopardy because “[e]ach count', '-9- required proof of a separate and additional fact that the other did not; to wit: murder and using a firearm, respectively.”', 'Id.', 'The same two offenses (murder and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence) are implicated here; thus, applicant’s constitutional rights were not violated by his convictions and resulting sentences for both offenses. Further, under a Hunter analysis, applicant’s claim also fails because “[i]n this statutory provision, the General Assembly clearly has expressed its intent that a guilty defendant should receive consecutive sentences.”', 'Rodriguez, 822 A.2d at 908; see also Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 794 (“It is the Legislature’s prerogative to authorize cumulative punishments; when it does so, it is the judicial task to impose that sentence in due course.”).', 'Therefore, we conclude that the judgments of conviction and sentence for both second- degree murder and discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of either the United States Constitution or the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'The applicant asserts that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because (a) trial counsel failed to argue that applicant was too intoxicated to knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily waive his right to remain silent, and (b) trial counsel failed to present a manslaughter defense based on diminished capacity at the plea bargaining stage and again at trial. This Court evaluates a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the criteria set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Guerrero v. State, 47 A.3d 289, 300 (R.I. 2012). “First, the applicant must establish that counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient; ‘[t]his requires [a] showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed * * * by the Sixth Amendment.’” Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 110-11 (R.I.', '- 10 - 2012) (quoting Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610). In making this determination, “we scrutinize the performance of counsel in a ‘highly deferential’ manner, * * * affording counsel ‘a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.’” Id. at 111. Only if it is determined that trial counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient does the Court proceed to the second prong of the Strickland test, in which the applicant “must show that the ‘deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.’” Guerrero, 47 A.3d at 300-01 (quoting Brennan v. Vose, 764 A.2d 168, 171 (R.I. 2001)).', 'A', 'The Motion to Suppress', 'The applicant argues that it was error for the trial justice to focus on the suppression hearing testimony, rather than Feinstein’s testimony at the postconviction relief hearing, in concluding that trial counsel’s decision not to seek exclusion of applicant’s statements to the police based on diminished capacity did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial justice began his analysis by noting that trial counsel did move to suppress the statements, “in part because he felt his client was prevented from making a phone call he thought [his client] was entitled to make.” The trial justice stated that applicant’s purported intoxication when he was questioned by the police was an issue in the suppression hearing: “[Trial counsel] didn’t speak too much about alcohol or his coherency, but I did.” After summarizing the case law on diminished capacity and an accused’s ability to understand and waive his Fifth Amendment rights, the trial justice recounted his finding that applicant’s statements to police were “made in a totally voluntary fashion.”', 'Later in his decision, after acknowledging Feinstein’s opinion testimony, the trial justice concluded that there was “no way” that trial counsel could have', '- 11 - successfully sought to suppress the statements based on Linde’s intoxication. He also found that the statements would have come into evidence in due course because applicant took the stand in his own defense and the statements would be allowable as prior inconsistent statements. See R.I. R. Evid. 801(d)(1) (prior inconsistent statements by a witness are not hearsay); see also Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 225-26 (1971) (holding that impeachment of the defendant testifying in his own defense with prior inconsistent statements does not violate Miranda). The trial justice found that this trial strategy was the product of applicant’s own statements to his attorney that he had a good memory of that evening and that his co-worker’s death was an accident. Accordingly, we agree with the findings of the trial justice: we are of the opinion that trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to specifically seek to suppress Linde’s statements to police based on applicant’s alleged diminished capacity, and note that, because he testified at trial, a necessary component in a defense of accident, the statements would have been used against him.', 'B', 'Manslaughter Defense and Plea Bargaining', 'The applicant points to trial counsel’s failure to present a manslaughter defense based on diminished capacity, both at trial and as grounds for a plea bargain as the basis for ineffective assistance of counsel. “Under a diminished-capacity defense, a defendant submits that, although he is responsible for the prohibited act, ‘his mental capacity may have been diminished by intoxication, trauma, or mental disease so that he did not possess the specific mental state or intent essential to the particular offense charged.’” Washington v. State, 989 A.2d 94, 101 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)).', '- 12 -', 'The applicant’s trial counsel, who is a senior, well-respected member of the criminal defense bar, gave forthright and candid testimony with respect to the dilemmas that he faced in formulating a defense in this case. He testified that applicant adamantly and repeatedly insisted that he had a clear memory of the events that took place and insisted that the shooting was an accident.', 'Thus, for trial counsel to present a diminished capacity defense in addition to applicant’s contention that it was an accident would require him to convince the jury that applicant’s memory of the events was such that they should believe his testimony that the shooting was an accident; but, on the other hand, if they did not believe applicant’s version of events, then they should find that he was so drunk that he could not form the requisite mental state for murder—an intentional killing of another human being. Trial counsel’s decision to proceed with the defense of accident without layering an additional diminished capacity defense was therefore a sound tactical decision, such that “tactical decisions by trial counsel, even if ill- advised, do not by themselves constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.” Rivera v. State, 58 A.3d 171, 180-81 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 18 (R.I. 2012)). “This Court ‘will not meticulously scrutinize an attorney’s reasoned judgment or strategic maneuver in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.’” Id. at 181 (quoting Rice, 38 A.3d at 17). In this case, counsel’s performance reflects not only a reasonable decision by a seasoned attorney, but was the only strategy available under the circumstances the client created.', 'Turning to the final issue—whether there should have been plea discussions in advance of trial—we are satisfied that trial counsel was not ineffective given the instruction from his client. It is undisputed that there was no offer from the state to resolve the case. It is also undisputed that the applicant notified his lawyer that he “wanted to go home and wanted complete exoneration.” Although we are cognizant of recent United States Supreme Court cases', '- 13 - that address the importance of the plea bargaining stage in a criminal trial, those cases are distinguishable from the case before us because the applicant’s trial counsel was faced with no plea offer from the state and a client demanding a complete exoneration, which is incompatible with a guilty plea. See, e.g., Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399, 1410 (2012) (“a defendant has no right to be offered a plea”); Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376, 1387 (2012) (“If no plea offer is made * * * the issue raised here simply does not arise.”); Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 374 (2010) (holding that “counsel must inform [his or] her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation”). Thus, we are of the opinion that counsel’s decision to proceed to trial was in accordance with his client’s wishes and did not constitute ineffective assistance.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

The plaintiff, Jeanne E. Johnson (plaintiff or Johnson), appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, QBAR Associates (defendant or QBAR) in this action seeking to vacate a final decree foreclosing her right to redeem property after a tax sale. Having the benefit of the arguments of counsel and having carefully examined the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 20, 2005, Johnson acquired a condominium unit, identified as unit 1938 located at 50 Abbott Run Valley Road in the Town of Cumberland (the property). On June 29, 2009, QBAR purchased the property at a tax sale, occasioned by the nonpayment of taxes assessed by the North Cumberland Fire District. The tax collector’s deed to the property was executed on August 19, 2009, and defendant recorded the deed in the land evidence records in Cumberland on August 21, 2009.', '-1-', 'On July 9, 2010—over a year after the tax sale—defendant filed a petition in Superior Court seeking to foreclose plaintiff’s right of redemption. On July 12, 2010—in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 44-9-32—defendant recorded, in the land evidence records for the Town of Cumberland, a notice that the petition had been filed in the Superior Court. The defendant later recorded a second notice—entitled “notice of filing of amended petition”—in the land evidence records on August 16, 2010, reflecting that an amended petition seeking to foreclose the right of redemption on the property had been filed with the Superior Court on August 12, 2010. 1 The record reflects that plaintiff filed an answer to the petition on September 28, 2010, and counsel entered an appearance on plaintiff’s behalf on May 10, 2011.', 'On April 15, 2011, a default was entered against all defendants in the action except “the Guardian Ad Litem, [the] Attorney representing persons in military service, [and] Jeanne E. Johnson.” A hearing date for entry of final decree was set for April 26, 2011; however, the case was continued on numerous occasions—apparently at plaintiff’s request—until August 16, 2011, when counsel for defendant appeared before a Superior Court justice and requested that an order enter foreclosing plaintiff’s right of redemption. Neither plaintiff nor her attorney appeared at this hearing; defendant’s attorney stated that plaintiff had been personally served and that an attorney had entered an appearance on plaintiff’s behalf. The defendant also indicated that plaintiff had requested seven continuances, in an attempt to reach a resolution. Despite these efforts, however, defendant’s attorney stated that he had learned from plaintiff’s attorney that Johnson did not intend to redeem the property.2 The Superior Court justice granted defendant’s 1', 'Unlike the first notice, the notice of filing of amended petition also named—in addition to Johnson—mortgagees who had an interest in the property. 2', 'Counsel for defendant also indicated that he had called plaintiff’s attorney on the Friday, Saturday, and Monday morning prior to the hearing, with no response.', '-2- motion and a final decree was entered, thereby foreclosing plaintiff’s right of redemption and vesting legal title to the property in defendant. A notice of the final disposition was entered and later filed in the Cumberland land evidence records on August 18, 2011, in accordance with § 44-9-32.', 'On November 9, 2011, plaintiff filed this action, seeking to vacate the final decree that foreclosed her right of redemption. Count 1 of plaintiff’s complaint alleged that—at the time the final decree was entered—Johnson had not been defaulted, nor had she had “her day in court,” and had therefore been denied due process of law. Count 2 of plaintiff’s complaint alleged that the initial and amended petitions to foreclose upon the right of redemption were “fatally defective” in that they referred to a tax deed from the “Tax Collector of the Town of Cumberland” although the grantor was actually the North Cumberland Fire District, “a separate and distinct corporation.” In this count plaintiff also argued that, if she had been given her day in court, she would have presented evidence that QBAR was not a registered legal entity, licensed to do business in the state, and therefore not capable of holding title to property or seeking to foreclose plaintiff’s right of redemption. The plaintiff also argued that the decree should be vacated because the previous owner of the property did not receive notice of the petition to foreclose.3', 'Shortly after the action was filed, defendant moved for summary judgment on all counts of plaintiff’s complaint, and this motion was taken up by a justice of the Superior Court on May 15, 2012. The defendant argued that pursuant to § 44-9-24—the statute governing independent actions to vacate an entry of a decree foreclosing upon the right of redemption—a validly entered 3', 'The plaintiff also sought temporary injunctive relief in count 3 of the complaint; namely, enjoining QBAR from proceeding with a separate trespass-and-eviction action seeking to remove plaintiff from the property.', '-3- foreclosure decree may be vacated on two discrete grounds only; namely, for lack of notice of the petition to foreclose, or because no taxes were due and owing on the property at the time of the tax sale.', 'The defendant claimed it was entitled to summary judgment because it was undisputed that plaintiff had received actual notice of the action and that plaintiff owed the taxes at the time of the tax sale.', 'In response, counsel for plaintiff argued that notice of the foreclosure petition was inadequate because it recited that the property was sold at tax sale by the tax collector of the Town of Cumberland, rather than the North Cumberland Fire District. The plaintiff also argued that final judgment was improper because plaintiff had not been defaulted in accordance with Rule 55 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff also argued that the tax sale was flawed, claiming that QBAR was not a legal entity at the time the property was purchased, and that therefore it was legally incapable of purchasing the property or filing the petition to foreclose upon the right of redemption.4', 'After hearing the arguments of the parties, the trial justice rendered a bench decision granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The trial justice determined that § 44-9-24 allowed for a final decree to be vacated only when a party did not receive notice of the petition to foreclose or because no taxes were owed. She therefore determined that count 1 of plaintiff’s complaint did not allege either of these two bases, nor was it necessary for a default to enter against plaintiff prior to the issuance of a final decree. As to count 2, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff could not establish a lack of notice of the filing of the petition because she personally was served with a citation specifying that the tax sale was a consequence of taxes 4', 'Although the Superior Court docket sheet reflects that plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to defendant’s motion for summary judgment, this memorandum is not contained in the lower-court file.', '-4- owed to the North Cumberland Fire District. As to the remaining arguments, the trial justice concluded that there existed no disputed issues of material fact which implicated either of the permissible grounds pursuant to which a final decree could be vacated under § 44-9-24.5 After the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted, plaintiff filed a timely appeal to this Court.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that this Court “reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 149-50 (R.I. 2012)). Using the same standards employed by the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, “‘we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,’ we will affirm the judgment.” Id. at 406-07 (quoting Sacco, 53 A.3d at 150). However, we also recognize that a party opposing a summary judgment motion has “an affirmative duty to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact.” Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 774 A.2d 40, 46 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Bourg v. Bristol Boat Co., 705 A.2d 969, 971 (R.I. 1998)).', 'It is similarly well settled that this Court “reviews questions of statutory construction de novo.” Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. DePina, 63 A.3d 871, 875 (R.I. 2013) (citing Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012)). “[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of 5', 'In ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the Superior Court justice did not address count 3 of plaintiff’s complaint—seeking injunctive relief—and noted that this count had been decided at a prior hearing where such relief was denied.', '-5- the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012)). Thus, “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Id. In doing so, “this Court will not broaden statutory provisions by judicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the clear intent or defining the terms of the statute.” Iselin v. Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049-50 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005)).', 'Discussion', 'On appeal to this Court, plaintiff contends that both the initial and amended notices of the petition to foreclose were inadequate under the provisions of § 44-9-24,6 because the notices referred to a tax sale and tax deed from the tax collector of the Town of Cumberland, and not the North Cumberland Fire District. The plaintiff also argues that a final decree forever barring her right of redemption could not have been entered without a default having entered against her. The plaintiff accordingly maintains that genuine issues of material fact exist and that the Superior Court justice therefore erred in granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment.', 'In Rhode Island, an owner’s right to redeem property after a tax sale is governed by chapter 9 of title 44. Initially, within one year following a tax sale, a person holding an interest in the property has an absolute right to redeem the property by paying the purchase price to the buyer at the tax sale or the holder of the tax deed, along with any accumulated fees, taxes, and penalties. See DePina, 63 A.3d at 876; see also § 44-9-21. If the property has not been 6', 'In pertinent part, G.L. 1956 § 44-9-24 states:', '“the action to vacate shall only be instituted for inadequacy of notice of the', 'petition amounting to a denial of due process or for the invalidity of the tax sale', 'because the taxes for which the property was sold had been paid or were not due', 'and owing because the property was exempt from the payment of such taxes.”', '-6- redeemed within that year, the purchaser at the tax sale may file a petition to foreclose upon any interested party’s right of redemption. DePina, 63 A.3d at 876; see also § 44-9-25(a). In order to do so, the purchaser is required to send notice of the foreclosure petition to all interested parties, including mortgagees of record. Section 44-9-27. Once notice of the petition is effectuated, any interested party may redeem the property by filing an answer to the petition along with an offer to redeem on or before the specified return day, which may be fixed no sooner than twenty days after the issuance of the notice. See §§ 44-9-27(a), 44-9-28 and 44-9-29. An interested party who wishes to contest the validity of the tax sale or the tax title must do so at the foreclosure hearing, “or else be forever barred from contesting or raising the question in any other proceeding.”', 'Section 44-9-31.', 'However, even when challenged—whether during or after redemption foreclosure proceedings—a tax sale or title may not be held to be invalid “by reason of any error or irregularity which is neither substantial nor misleading.” Section 44-9-35. If an interested party fails to comply with the procedure specified in chapter 9 of title 44, or to redeem within the allotted timeframe, “a decree shall be entered which shall forever bar all rights of redemption.” Kildeer Realty v. Brewster Realty Corp., 826 A.2d 961, 966 (R.I. 2003) (quoting § 44-9-30).', 'This Court previously has acknowledged that “[a] tax sale foreclosure proceeding ‘is a unique procedure created by statute for a limited purpose[:] to provide a forum for the exercise of the right to redeem the subject land.’” Rafaelian v. Perfecto Iron Works, Inc., 68 A.3d 57, 59 (R.I. 2013) (quoting ABAR Associates v. Luna, 870 A.2d 990, 994 (R.I. 2005)).', 'When confronted with issues arising from such a proceeding, we are cognizant that, “because of a property owner’s disproportionate loss, ‘[l]egislatures and courts have acted to ameliorate the severity of tax forfeitures.’” Medeiros v. Bankers Trust Co., 38 A.3d 1112, 1117 (R.I. 2012)', '-7- (quoting ABAR, 870 A.2d at 994). Nonetheless, we have recognized that “the Rhode Island tax statute ‘strikes a fair balance between the interests of the government and private property rights—the state [or taxing authority] may move quickly to obtain by sale the taxes due, but the owner has ample opportunity to redeem his real estate.’” Id. at 1117-18 (quoting ABAR, 870 A.2d at 994). This is because “one of the goals of the tax sale statute is to ‘afford a measure of stability to tax titles.’” Id. at 1118 (quoting ABAR, 870 A.2d at 994). Accordingly, because the foreclosure of the right of redemption “is a statutory proceeding and not an ordinary civil action, the jurisdiction of the Superior Court is sharply circumscribed.”7 ABAR, 870 A.2d at 994 (citing Pratt v. Woolley, 117 R.I. 154, 157, 365 A.2d 424, 426 (1976)). It is through this lens that we analyze plaintiff’s arguments on appeal.', 'Our interpretation of chapter 9 of title 44 of the General Laws is of primary importance to the present appeal. Pursuant to § 44-9-24,', '“The title conveyed by a tax collector’s deed shall be', 'absolute after foreclosure of the right of redemption by decree of', 'the [S]uperior [C]ourt * * *. Notwithstanding the rules of civil', 'procedure * * * no decree shall be vacated except in a separate', 'action instituted within one year following entry of the decree', '* * *. Furthermore, the action to vacate shall only be instituted for', 'inadequacy of notice of the petition amounting to a denial of due', 'process or for the invalidity of the tax sale because the taxes for', 'which the property was sold had been paid or were not due and', 'owing because the property was exempt from the payment of such', 'taxes.” (Emphasis added.)', 'It is undisputed that plaintiff properly filed a separate action to vacate the decree foreclosing her right to redeem the property and therefore is limited to the grounds set forth in § 44-9-24 in seeking to vacate the decree. Because plaintiff does not dispute that the taxes for 7', 'It is also worth noting that tax sale foreclosure proceedings are specifically exempted from the operation of the Rules of Civil Procedure by Rule 81(a)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides: “These rules do not apply to the following proceedings: * * * Petitions for foreclosure of redemption of interests in land sold for nonpayment of taxes * * *.”', '-8- which the property was sold were due and owing, she bases her argument upon the “inadequacy of notice of the petition amounting to a denial of due process.” Section 44-9-24. However, while the record reflects that both the initial and amended notices incorrectly referenced the tax collector of the Town of Cumberland, plaintiff does not contest that she received actual notice of the petition. In fact, plaintiff was personally served with a citation that correctly referenced a tax sale and tax deed by the North Cumberland Fire District. The plaintiff retained an attorney, filed an answer, and had the benefit of several continuances before entry of the final decree. Accordingly, in this case there is no suggestion in the record that plaintiff was deprived of due process or that the irregularity complained of within the petition was substantial or misleading. See DePina, 63 A.3d at 881 (error must be substantial or misleading to invalidate tax title); see also § 44-9-35.', 'Turning to plaintiff’s next argument, that a final decree could not have entered without a default having first entered against her, § 44-9-30 clearly states that', '“If a default is entered under § 44-9-28, or if redemption is', 'not made within the time and upon the terms fixed by the court', 'under § 44-9-29, or if at the time fixed for the hearing the person', 'claiming the right to redeem does not appear to urge his or her', 'claim, or if upon hearing the court determines that the facts shown', 'do not entitle the person to redeem, a decree shall be entered which', 'shall forever bar all rights of redemption.” (Emphases added.)', 'Accordingly, the explicit language of § 44-9-30 clearly provides that a default is not a prerequisite to the entry of a final decree foreclosing the right of redemption. Indeed, the record reflects that a default could not have entered against plaintiff because she answered the petition. The fact that plaintiff had filed an answer and was represented by counsel was disclosed to the Superior Court justice who entered the final decree; thus, there is no indication that the final decree foreclosing plaintiff’s right to redemption was entered in error. However, whether or not a default was entered is irrelevant to our resolution of this case, because—after filing a separate', '-9- action to vacate the final decree foreclosing on her right to redemption—plaintiff may challenge the entry of that final decree only on the grounds enunciated in § 44-9-24.', 'We note that the plaintiff also sets forth a number of arguments on appeal that were not argued in the Superior Court. First, the plaintiff claims the term “inadequacy of notice” found in § 44-9-24 is unconstitutionally vague and therefore violative of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. In a similar vein, the plaintiff argues that allowing a final decree foreclosing upon the right of redemption to be vacated only for inadequacy of notice is unconstitutionally restrictive, because a denial of due process may occur at any stage of litigation. 8 Finally, the plaintiff argues that the tax deed itself was compromised because QBAR did not disclose on the tax sale deed its legal status. We decline to address these arguments based on our well-settled raise-or-waive rule.9 See Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 432 (R.I. 2005) (argument that the statutory scheme controlling foreclosure of the right of redemption is unconstitutional barred by the raise-or-waive rule).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court. 8', 'The plaintiff also argues that, according to the notice of disposal filed in the land evidence records, the final decree was issued “based upon the Affidavit filed in this matter,” when no affidavit was in fact filed, thus amounting to a denial of due process. We deem this unavailing. 9', 'We pause to note that there is no indication that, in accordance with Rule 24(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiff served the Attorney General with notice of the constitutional challenges to § 44-9-24.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Jeanne E.
