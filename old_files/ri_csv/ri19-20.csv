0,: In re 38 Studios Grand Jury. : :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. In this controversy, two constitutional officers of this state, the Governor and the Attorney General, present us with conflicting views about whether certain grand jury materials should become available to the public or whether, in the alternative, those materials should be protected from public view in accordance with existing court rules and centuries of cautious precedent. The Governor and the Attorney General have both vigorously and articulately argued their positions as each sees her or his constitutional responsibilities. In essence, the question presented to this Court is: Is the Superior Court vested with the “inherent supervisory authority” to order the public disclosure of grand jury materials—materials that are generally kept secret—from a grand jury that adjourned less than five years ago, that could potentially be reopened, and that dealt with events for which the potentially relevant statute of limitations has not yet run? In her official capacity, Governor Gina M. Raimondo asks this Court to answer that question in the affirmative on appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court that answered the', '-1- question in the negative. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, this Court affirms the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'There can be no question that the Governor’s appeal involves a matter of intense public concern with which many, if not most, Rhode Islanders are familiar. In 2010, the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a quasi-public corporation created by the Rhode Island General Assembly, issued $75 million in bonds to guarantee loans for 38 Studios, a video game company headed by former Boston Red Sox World Series hero Curt Schilling. As is painfully well-known, just two years later 38 Studios failed and did not honor its obligation to repay the bonds, leaving the taxpayers of Rhode Island to foot an $88 million bill. 1', 'In 2012, a statewide grand jury convened to investigate the possibility of potential criminality in connection with the 38 Studios deal. That grand jury sat for eighteen months and, as has been confirmed by the Attorney General, completed its work in 2015. During the course of the investigation, which began before the convening of the grand jury, approximately 146 individuals, including members of the 2010 General Assembly, were interviewed or called to testify before the grand jury. However, at the conclusion of the grand jury investigation, in a joint statement, the Attorney General and the Rhode Island State Police announced that there were not any “provable criminal violations of the Rhode Island General [L]aws in connection with the funding of 38 Studios, the disbursement of funds to 38 Studios, and by 38 Studios to vendors.” 1', 'As is explained later in this opinion, the state initiated litigation against a host of what it regarded as responsible parties and recovered over $61 million in settlements.', '-2-', 'Independent of the grand jury investigation, the state initiated civil litigation against persons and entities that had been involved in the 38 Studios deal. The settlements recovered in excess of $61 million for taxpayers, and hundreds of thousands of documents produced during the course of litigation were made public. Following the close of the civil litigation, the Governor filed a miscellaneous petition in the Superior Court in February 2017, seeking “the release of all 38 Studios Grand Jury Records[.]”', 'To support her petition, the Governor argued: (1) that the Superior Court, in exceptional circumstances, has the discretion to release grand jury materials; (2) that exceptional circumstances exist; and (3) that the need for grand jury secrecy is outweighed by those exceptional circumstances. The Attorney General opposed the Governor’s petition. The Presiding Justice of the Superior Court heard the petition in April 2017, and thereafter rendered a thorough twenty- four-page written decision in which she determined that, because the Governor was not seeking disclosure pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs grand jury secrecy and permits disclosure of grand jury materials in certain enumerated instances, she was without authority to grant the Governor’s petition. However, although she founded her ruling on the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Presiding Justice also conducted alternative analyses and ruled that, even if the Superior Court had the authority to go beyond Rule 6(e) to allow disclosure of the grand jury materials requested, the grand jury materials in this case should not be disclosed because the Governor had failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the information requested and, separately, because policy factors that courts consider when', '-3- determining if grand jury disclosure is appropriate did not support disclosure in this case. Judgment therefore entered denying the petition, and the Governor timely appealed. 2', 'Before this Court, the Governor asserts that it was error for the Presiding Justice to read Rule 6(e) as the sole avenue by which grand jury materials may be disclosed. She argues that, beyond the specific provisions of Rule 6(e), the Superior Court is cloaked with the “inherent authority” to disclose the material that she has requested. The Governor also contends that the Presiding Justice erred when she engaged in alternative analyses. In this regard, the Governor maintains that the Presiding Justice should not have applied the “particularized need” test to the petition for disclosure because that test applies only when evaluating a request for disclosure pursuant to Rule 6(e). Further, the Governor argues that the Presiding Justice abused her discretion when she determined, in the Governor’s words, “that the Governor’s disclosure request failed to meet factors in favor of the release of grand jury material.”', 'II', 'Discussion', 'This case raises a weighty question of first impression in this jurisdiction. That is, whether the Superior Court has inherent authority to disclose grand jury materials beyond the parameters of the permitted disclosures that are set forth in Rule 6(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. This question is of grave importance because it concerns an institution that plays a critical role in our criminal justice system. Indeed, it often has been said that the grand jury “serves the dual function of determining if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been 2', 'We granted a motion by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, Common Cause Rhode Island, The New England First Amendment Coalition, and the Rhode Island Press Association to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of the Governor’s petition. We have found that brief to be thoughtful and scholarly, and we thank the amici for their participation.', '-4- committed and of protecting citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions.” In re Doe, 717 A.2d 1129, 1134 (R.I. 1998) (quoting United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U.S. 418, 423 (1983)). Despite these important roles, however, it remains true that the function of the modern- day grand jury is not well known, even to many lawyers. See Paul S. Diamond, Federal Grand Jury Practice & Procedure § 1.01 at 1 (5th ed. 2012).', 'In Rhode Island, there exist both county and statewide grand juries. See G.L. 1956 chapters 11 and 11.1 of title 12. An individual in Rhode Island cannot be tried on any felony carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without an indictment having been issued by a grand jury. R.I. Const., art. 1, § 7; Super. R. Crim. P. 7(a). Grand juries not only pass on whether to indict those charged or suspected of serious crimes, but they also serve an investigatory function. See State v. Guido, 698 A.2d 729, 735 (R.I. 1997) (discussing the grand jury’s “interrelated but distinct functions” of investigation and indicting). A prosecutor who presents evidence and witnesses before the grand jury has the power to, “in practice, select the witnesses to be subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury and generally direct the investigation.” Id. at 736 (quoting In re Melvin, 546 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1976)). The prosecutor presents the evidence, and the relevant law, to the grand jury and may ultimately ask the grand jury to vote on an indictment. See Super. R. Crim. P. 6(f) (“An indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of twelve (12) or more jurors and shall be signed by each juror who concurred in the finding.”).', 'In some cases, the prosecutor will have all of the information that he or she requires for an indictment readily available. Those types of cases would most commonly involve criminal offenses that require indictment by a grand jury, those that, as mentioned above, carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. That type of grand jury, which does not conduct an investigation but rather acts on a request to issue an indictment, is known as an “indicting grand jury.” 1 Sara', '-5- Sun Beale, Grand Jury Law and Practice § 1:7 at 31 (2d ed. 2018). In other cases, however, the state may be uncertain as to whether proof of criminal conduct exists; in that situation, it will use the grand jury to compel witness testimony and receive evidence to determine whether provable criminal conduct has taken place. See id. at 32-33 (discussing the utility of the investigative grand jury and noting that it “is particularly well-suited to investigating business crime, political corruption, organized crime, and other criminal activity where there is no identifiable victim to report the offense and help investigative agencies”). When the government employs a grand jury in this way, it is commonly referred to as an “investigative grand jury.” Id. at 31. Of course, after the completion of the investigation, if the government believes that there is sufficient evidence of provable criminal conduct, it will ask the grand jury to vote on whether to indict. If an indictment is returned, the case is charged and proceeds to trial or other disposition.', 'A grand jury that hears evidence, and that may be asked by the government to vote on indictments, is made up of between thirteen and twenty-three individuals who are selected at random from the general public. Sections 12-11.1-1 and 12-11.1-4; see G.L. 1956 § 9-9-1.1. Indeed, any person who is a citizen of the United States, resides in Rhode Island, is at least eighteen years of age, is able to understand and participate in the proceedings, and is capable of performing the duties of a juror is qualified to serve. Section 9-9-1.1. As such, the process is considerably democratic and affords targets of the grand jury the protection that accompanies review by their fellow citizens. However, and as previously discussed, the grand jury also affords the government considerable powers; if it suspects criminal activity, the government can hale witnesses and evidence before the grand jury in an inquisitorial fashion. See Guido, 698 A.2d at 735 (“[T]he grand jury may compel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as it considers appropriate, and its operation generally is unrestrained by the technical procedural and evidentiary', '-6- rules governing the conduct of criminal trials.” (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 343 (1974))). Importantly, and unlike the more familiar petit jury of twelve, unanimity is not required of a grand jury. See Super. R. Crim. P. 6(f).', 'In order to better understand the “dual function” of the grand jury, and to better evaluate the Governor’s request to release the 38 Studios grand jury material, we will provide an overview of the history of the institution.', 'A', 'A Brief History of the Grand Jury and the Modern Secrecy Rule', 'English Roots', 'The history of the grand jury begins in England nearly a millennium ago during the twelfth century. King Henry II, in the enactment known as the Assize of Clarendon, established the initial form of the grand jury. Richard H. Helmholz, The Early History of the Grand Jury and the Canon Law, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 613, 613 (1983); Susan M. Schiappa, Preserving the Autonomy and Function of the Grand Jury: United States v. Williams, 43 Cath. U.L. Rev. 311, 324-25 (1993). 3 In its early form, the grand jury was made up of twelve men from each township who charged the accused in place of the victim. Schiappa, 43 Cath. U.L. Rev. at 325. Far from being a bastion against unfounded accusations, it has been said that: “The repressive nature of the medieval grand jury cannot reasonably be questioned.” Diamond, supra, § 1.01 at 3. Indeed, the system as initially established was instituted as a means of increasing the power of the Crown, relative to the church and the nobility, and to raise money, because it was the King who received the resulting fines and 3', 'Historically, an assize could refer to a number of things, including “[a] session of a court or council” or “[a] law enacted by such a body[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 150 (11th ed. 2019). Specifically, the Assize of Clarendon was “[a] decree issued in 1166 by Henry II to the justices in eyre and sheriffs concerning criminal procedure.” Id. at 151.', '-7- forfeitures.

In fact, “[i]f the jurors failed to accuse a ‘known’ criminal, they were heavily fined.” Diamond, supra, § 1.01 at 3. 4 Ominously, accusal by a grand jury was often followed by trial by ordeal; as such, “a grand jury’s accusation was tantamount to a finding of guilt.” Id., § 1.01 at 4; see Kadish, 24 Fla. St. U.L. Rev. at 6-7; Schiappa, 43 Cath. U.L. Rev. at 325 n.71. 5', 'By 1215, however, the incipient building blocks of due process were laid when King John signed the Magna Carta. Kadish, 24 Fla. St. U.L. Rev. at 7. Although the Magna Carta did not specifically refer to the grand jury, “[i]t did * * * introduce the concept of due process against which any procedural practice [of the day] must be measured.” Id. Then, by the fourteenth century, during the reign of Edward III, the process of criminal prosecution in England morphed once again. Id. at 8. The role of the twelve men who, under the reign of King Henry II, would have made accusations that were essentially confirmed by trial by ordeal, was altered. Id. The accusatorial role was, instead, assumed by twenty-four knights who were selected by the county sheriff. Id. The twelve men previously responsible for accusations now functioned to return a verdict in cases of capital crime. Id. This body of twelve was called the petit jury. Id. Accusation in a grand jury followed by trial by petit jury is reflective of the course of criminal prosecution today. Nevertheless, that does not mean that, in those early days, criminal justice included the protections 4', 'Professor Helmholz clarifies that, under the Assize, “sworn men of the inquest were asked not to accuse anyone * * * but to give voice to common fame[.]” Richard H.

Rev. 613, 616-17 (1983). 5', 'In one odd rendition of trial by ordeal, an accused would be made to swallow a piece of bread or cheese whole. Susan M. Schiappa, Preserving the Autonomy and Function of the Grand Jury: United States v. Williams, 43 Cath. U.L. Rev. 311, 324 n.68 (1993). Only if the accused did not choke to death would he be found not guilty. Id. The extent of usage of this particular ordeal is unclear; however, the use of water to try the accused seems to have been the preferred method. See id. at 325 n.71; Helmholz, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 617.', '-8- that we enjoy today. If the King was displeased, he could fine or imprison jury members who failed to convict—and he often did. Id. at 8-9.', 'It was “[n]ot until the 17th century * * * [that] the English grand jury earn[ed] its reputation as a body that not only accused the guilty, but also shielded the innocent from unfounded charges.” Beale, supra, § 1:2 at 9. As early as 1642, Lord Coke, the famous English jurist, interpreted the Magna Carta as requiring “indictment or presentment of good and lawful men.” 6 Id. Later, in 1681, two separate London grand juries, despite facing significant pressure from the Catholic- leaning King Charles II, declined to indict two of the King’s Protestant enemies for treason. See id., § 1:2 at 9-10; Diamond, supra, § 1.01 at 4; Schiappa, 43 Cath. U.L. Rev. at 327. Undaunted, the Crown empaneled a grand jury from a different county, resulting in the indictment of one of the King’s Protestant targets, who was ultimately tried and executed. See id., § 1:2 at 10; Diamond, supra, § 1.01 at 5-6. The other target fled into exile. See id.; Diamond, supra, § 1.01 at 5-6. Even in the face of these outcomes, “the London grand juries’ refusal to indict in these cases was hailed as a demonstration that the grand jury was one of the chief safeguards of the liberty of Englishmen.” Id.', 'America', 'The grand jury was used for instituting criminal charges in all the English colonies in America.

In Massachusetts, for example, a grand jury refused to indict the Boston Gazette for libel against the governor. Id. In New York, multiple grand juries similarly refused to indict publisher John Peter Zenger, of the New York Weekly Journal, for libel against the governor of that colony. Id.; Schiappa, 43 Cath. U.L. Rev. at 329.', 'After this country had achieved independence, the tradition of using the grand jury for the bringing of criminal charges continued. Beale, supra, § 1:4 at 15-16. The former colonists’ experiences with grand juries during the Revolution, as well as the English legal sources that the colonists had available to them, influenced the founders of the new state governments. Id., § 1:4 at 16. Those sources, from Lord Coke to William Blackstone, “uniformly focused on the grand jury’s role in protecting suspects against malicious and unfounded accusations.” Id. It is true that the grand jury was not provided for in the United States Constitution when it was adopted, but by 1791, the Fifth Amendment had been ratified. See id., § 1:4 at 19; Kadish, 24 Fla.

The United States Supreme Court has, since at least the nineteenth century, described the grand jury as an institution “designed as a means, not only of bringing to trial persons accused of public offenses upon just grounds, but also as a means of protecting the citizen against unfounded accusation[.]” Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 11 (1887) (quoting In re Charge to Grand Jury, 30 F.

It should be recognized that, as the grand jury evolved, the tradition of grand jury secrecy was born. See Kadish, 24 Fla. St. U.L. Rev. at 12- 13. The oath that members of the grand jury were required to take did not include a vow of secrecy until the fourteenth century. Id. at 13. However, by the seventeenth century, the oath that was administered to grand jurors was similar to the oath in use in the 1940s, when the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were established. Id. at 13-14.', 'One eminent legal scholar of the late seventeenth century, John Somers, explained that there were five reasons behind grand jury secrecy: to prevent criminals from fleeing; to determine whether witnesses were biased; to prevent judicial oversight; to enhance the truth-finding process; and to allow for the evidence to be fully developed. Id. at 14-15. Somers explained that, even though those benefits were for the King’s interest, secrecy also had the effect of protecting the innocent accused. Id. at 15-16.', 'That notion—that confidentiality benefited those who were brought before the grand jury—soon took root in the United States.

See Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 757 (7th Cir. 2016). Although the Governor’s standing to petition the Superior Court to release the 38 Studios grand jury material was not challenged in the Superior Court, standing is a prerequisite to a court’s entertaining a claim or petition, and the issue may be raised by this Court sua sponte. Robinson v. Mayo, 849 A.2d 351, 353 n.2 (R.I. 2004) (acknowledging this Court’s “authority to reach the issue of standing * * * sua sponte”).', 'Standing is a component of justiciability that ensures that a complaining party has “such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness[,] which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult * * * questions[,]” exists. Watson v. Fox, 44 A.3d 130, 135 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)). To have standing, the party that believes itself to be aggrieved “must allege ‘that the challenged action has caused him injury in fact, economic or otherwise.’” Id. (quoting Rhode Island Ophthalmological Society v. Cannon, 113 R.I. 16, 22, 317 A.2d 124, 128 (1974)). That injury-in-fact must be “concrete and particularized[.]” Id. at 135-36 (quoting McKenna v.

Nevertheless, this Court ordered the parties to be prepared to address at oral argument whether the Governor does indeed have standing and whether, if this Court were to find that she does not, the lack of standing should be overlooked. At oral argument, the Governor argued that she has suffered a unique injury because, each year, when putting together the annual budget proposal for the state, she must allocate funds to pay off the remainder of the 38 Studios debt. She also argued that, as Governor and chairperson of the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, her injury is unique. 8 At the same time, however, the Governor argues that the alleged injury is one shared by the general public; that is, the public’s inability to secure full transparency with respect to the series of events culminating in 38 Studios’ bankruptcy and the ensuing litigation. She also maintains that any member of the public has standing to petition the court to release court records.', 'On the other hand, the Attorney General argues that the Governor does not have standing and that the disclosure the Governor seeks—disclosure to the general public—is reflective of the Governor’s lack of particularized harm. If the harm alleged by the Governor were particularized, the Attorney General argues, the Governor would be requesting that the materials sought be disclosed directly to the Governor alone to remedy the harm. Thus, the Attorney General contends, 8', 'The Rhode Island Commerce Corporation is the successor organization to the EDC, of which the office of the Governor was also the chairperson.', '- 14 - because disclosure is sought for the public at large, the harm cannot be characterized as “particularized.”', 'To support her claim that she has standing, the Governor draws this Court’s attention to a 2016 case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Carlson, cited supra. In that case, a three-judge panel of that court considered whether Carlson, “a journalist and historian with a special expertise in naval history” who petitioned the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to unseal certain grand jury materials related to a 1942 Chicago Tribune article following the Battle of Midway that suggested that the United States had broken a Japanese code, while he was writing a book about that very article seventy years later, had standing. Carlson, 837 F.3d at 755, 756, 757. The court determined that Carlson did have standing, reasoning that grand jury materials are court records and, because the public has a general right to view such records, as a member of the public his injury-in-fact was “the denial of access to government documents that he ha[d] a right to seek.” Id. at 758, 759.', 'Although we understand why the Governor believes that Carlson supports her position, we believe that the matter before us is readily distinguishable from Carlson, in particular with respect to the issue of standing. First, when a member of the general public brings a claim, that individual still needs to demonstrate a harm different from the harm shared by every other member of the public. See Watson, 44 A.3d at 136. While Carlson, which was decided by a divided three-judge panel, may seem to suggest otherwise when it comes to petitioning for access to grand jury records, Carlson, 837 F.3d at 759 (“That Carlson is a member of the public is sufficient for him to assert his ‘general right to inspect and copy judicial records.’”) (deletion and internal citation omitted), we disagree with that sweeping holding and note that the standing analysis in Carlson appears to have been colored by the fact that the petitioner was a historian writing a book about a long-ago', '- 15 - Chicago Tribune article that was the subject of the grand jury materials that he was seeking. Carlson, 837 F.3d at 756, 757. Thus, Carlson’s injury was particularized.', 'In contrast, the Governor argued in the Superior Court that “Rhode Islanders should have full disclosure about [the] disastrous [38 Studios] deal. * * * [The Superior] Court should permit the release of all the grand jury material from the 38 Studios investigation so that our State can finally move past this unfortunate episode in our history.” This is a clear allegation of a harm that is shared by the public at large, not one that is particular to the Governor in any way.', 'Second, in this case the Governor, unlike the petitioner in Carlson, is not seeking disclosure of the 38 Studios grand jury material as a member of the general public, but rather in her official capacity as the Governor of the State of Rhode Island. In that respect, and as has been recognized, the Governor argues that her injury is unique because she must allocate monies to pay off the remaining 38 Studios debt. Again, she also argues that her injury is unique given her position as Governor and chairperson of the successor organization to the EDC, which authorized the issuance of the 38 Studios bonds. Clearly, Carlson does not speak to such arguments. And, moreover, it is our opinion that, despite her responsibilities as Governor, which we certainly do not minimize, these arguments do not establish an injury-in-fact. Further, as the Attorney General points out, if the Governor’s harm was particularized, that harm could be remedied by disclosure directly to the Governor’s office. Instead, the Governor seeks public disclosure of all the grand jury material. Moreover, it is unclear to us how gaining access to the grand jury material would actually assist the Governor in the performance of her official duties.', 'ii', 'It is our opinion that the Governor does not meet the traditional requirements for standing that would enable her to petition for release of the materials she seeks. Nonetheless, it has long', '- 16 - been part of our jurisprudence that “on rare occasions this Court has overlooked the standing requirement to determine the merits of a case of substantial public interest.” Watson, 44 A.3d at 138 (brackets omitted) (quoting Burns v. Sundlun, 617 A.2d 114, 116 (R.I. 1992)); see Sennott v. Hawksley, 103 R.I. 730, 732, 241 A.2d 286, 287 (1968) (explaining that “because there was a substantial public interest in the adoption or rejection of a new constitution,” and due to other considerations, the Court would determine whether the constitutional convention exceeded its authority “without first resolving the standing question”).', 'We cannot fail to recognize that the issue which has been framed is one that, as the Governor has so capably demonstrated, is of immense public interest. In her words, “[e]ven six years after the company closed its doors, the 38 Studios transaction and its consequences still makes front-page news.” Moreover, we emphasize that this case does contain an element of the “concrete adverseness” that this Court relies upon to “sharpen[] the presentation of issues[.]” Watson, 44 A.3d at 135 (quoting Baker, 369 U.S. at 204). The case has been skillfully briefed and argued in the Superior Court and in this Court by some of the most highly regarded public attorneys in the state.', 'For these reasons, we shall overlook the absence of the traditional elements of standing and reach the merits of the controversy before us.', 'C', 'Does the Superior Court Have the Inherent Authority to Release Grand Jury Materials', 'Outside of Rule 6(e)?', 'The Governor first argues that it was error for the Superior Court to read Rule 6(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure as disallowing disclosure that does not have firm footing within the dictates of the rule. The Governor’s argument is that the Superior Court is cloaked with inherent supervisory authority over the grand jury and, as had been the case with', '- 17 - some federal decisions, that authority includes the discretion to disclose grand jury material where there exists “special or exceptional circumstances.” 9 Moreover, she argues that the permitted disclosures in Rule 6(e) are just that, permissive and nonexclusive, and that Rule 6(e) does not preclude disclosures by the Superior Court in other circumstances. The Governor further asserts that the general rule of secrecy contained in Rule 6(e) is limited to specific persons and does not apply to the Superior Court itself.', 'In contrast, the Attorney General maintains that the disclosures permitted by Rule 6(e) are all-inclusive. Rule 6(e), the Attorney General argues, “requires grand jury secrecy be maintained ‘except as otherwise provided for in these rules[.]’” (Quoting Rule 6(e)(2).) According to the Attorney General, because the Governor does not seek disclosure pursuant to the rigid requirements of Rule 6(e), the Governor’s request must fail.', 'Whether the Superior Court has inherent authority to release grand jury materials outside of the permitted disclosures set forth in Rule 6(e) is a question of law. As such, our standard of review is de novo. Dellagrotta v. Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d 101, 109 (R.I. 2005).', 'We begin our analysis with the text of that rule. In its current form, Rule 6(e)(2) provides the “General Rule of Secrecy.” It states:', '“A grand juror, an interpreter, a stenographer, an operator of a', 'recording device, a typist who transcribes recorded testimony, an', 'attorney for the State, or any person to whom disclosure is made', 'under subdivision (e)(3)(A)(ii) shall not disclose matters occurring', 'before the grand jury, except as otherwise provided for in these', 'rules. A knowing violation of Rule 6 may be punished as a contempt', 'of court.” Super. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2). The very next provision of Rule 6(e) permits certain “[d]isclosure otherwise prohibited by this rule” that “may be made” in a number of circumstances. Rule 6(e)(3)(A) and (C).', 'Rule 9', 'The Governor forthrightly states that she “is not seeking disclosure pursuant to Rule 6(e).”', '- 18 - 6(e)(3)(A)(i) and (ii) permit disclosure to “[a]n attorney for the State for use in the performance of such attorney’s duty” and to “government personnel * * * deemed necessary by an attorney for the State to assist an attorney for the State in the performance of such attorney’s duty to enforce criminal law.” Rule 6(e)(3)(C) permits disclosure in four other circumstances, three of which require that the court itself must pass on the propriety of the disclosure:', '“(i) When so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection', 'with a judicial proceeding; (ii) When permitted by a court at the', 'request of the defendant * * *; (iii) When the disclosure is made by', 'an attorney for the State to another grand jury; or (iv) When', 'permitted by a court at the request of an attorney for the State * * *', 'to an appropriate official of the federal government for the purpose', 'of enforcing such [federal criminal] law.”', 'Rule 6(e), as we have said in the past, “codifies the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy[.]” In re Doe, 717 A.2d at 1134. We have not yet, however, had occasion to determine just how much control Rule 6 exercises over the Superior Court’s common-law authority over the grand jury. Both the Governor and the Attorney General make strong arguments. The Governor rightly points out that Rule 6(e)(2), the general secrecy provision, does not mention the Superior Court itself as an entity held to secrecy. Rather, the rule specifically lists “[a] grand juror, an interpreter, a stenographer, an operator of a recording device, a typist * * *, an attorney for the State, or any person to whom disclosure is made [pursuant to a particular provision permitting disclosure]” as those entities bound to secrecy. Super. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2). On the other hand, the Attorney General also rightly points out that Rule 6(e)(2) specifically holds to secrecy those employees of the Superior Court, in his words, “who would have direct knowledge or possession of grand jury materials” and, he adds, that it is sensible for the Superior Court itself not to be enumerated in the rule because the Superior Court itself does not actually come into contact with grand jury material.', '- 19 -', 'With respect to the Governor’s assertion that Rule 6(e) is permissive, the stripes of this argument bleed into the question of whether the Superior Court has inherent authority to release grand jury materials outside of the exceptions to grand jury secrecy listed above. That is, if disclosure is a matter of total discretion within the Superior Court’s inherent authority, then the rule is in fact permissive, or demonstrative, of that authority. On the other hand, if such inherent authority does not exist, the rule expresses the full extent of the Superior Court’s authority with respect to disclosure. We therefore move directly to whether the Superior Court has such inherent authority.', 'The Governor is correct that we have in the past endorsed the principle “that the grand jury is an arm of the Superior Court[,]” and also that “[i]t is not under the control of the Attorney General.” In re Young, 755 A.2d 842, 843 (R.I. 2000) (mem.). The Governor also argues that historically included in the inherent authority of courts over the grand jury is the discretion to disclose grand jury materials that would normally be secret; she points out that Rhode Island courts have recognized that “[t]he granting of access to Grand Jury materials is a matter within the discretion of the Superior Court.” In re Station Fire Grand Jury, 2006 R.I. Super. LEXIS 193, at *4 (R.I. Super. Ct. Dec. 21, 2006). Indeed, this Court has determined that whether to disclose grand jury materials is, in appropriate instances, a matter within the discretion of the Superior Court. See State v. Ouimette, 110 R.I. 747, 764, 298 A.2d 124, 135 (1972).', 'In Ouimette, a case tried in the Superior Court two years before the adoption of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and decided by this Court just months after their adoption, we considered whether a justice of the Superior Court erred in denying the requests of two defendants to inspect grand jury minutes in connection with their defenses at their trials for murder. Ouimette, 110 R.I. at 763-64, 298 A.2d at 134-35. While we ultimately concluded that the Superior Court', '- 20 - did not commit error because the defendants failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the information requested, we indicated that we were making our determination through the prism of an abuse of discretion standard. Id. at 764, 298 A.2d at 135. That case, however, cannot stand for the proposition that our Superior Court has, or always has had, wide-reaching discretion when it comes to disclosure of grand jury materials. The defendants in Ouimette were seeking to make use of grand jury materials in connection with their defenses to the capital crimes with which they had been charged—a circumstance under which Rule 6(e) would not prevent disclosure. See Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) (permitting disclosure “[w]hen so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding”). 10', 'Similarly, In re Station Fire Grand Jury, the case which the Governor quotes for the proposition that Rhode Island courts have the discretion to disclose grand jury material, specifically addressed whether disclosure was appropriate in connection with ongoing litigation, pursuant to Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i). In re Station Fire Grand Jury, 2006 R.I. Super. LEXIS 193, at *3, *4, *5-6, *21. These cases, therefore, provide little guidance as we grapple with the question before us. 11 10', 'It is noteworthy that today, Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the reciprocal discovery rule, independently provides for disclosure of certain grand jury materials in instances such as those in State v. Ouimette, 110 R.I. 747, 298 A.2d 124 (1972). 11', 'The United States Supreme Court cases on which the Governor relies for the general proposition that historically the courts had discretion to disclose grand jury materials that would normally be secret similarly provide us scant guidance as we consider the Governor’s disclosure request. Both cases cited by the Governor for that proposition include allusions to the discretion of the trial court, but in very different circumstances than the case presently before us. See Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company v. United States, 360 U.S. 395, 399, 401 (1959) (stating that “Rule 6(e) is but declaratory of” the principle that disclosure of grand jury material is “committed to the discretion of the trial judge” in a case where defendants argued they had an absolute right to inspect certain grand jury minutes); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233 (1940) (stating that the “use of grand jury testimony for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of a witness rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge”). Interestingly, in Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, the United States', '- 21 -', 'As the Attorney General points out, this Court, in a case that was decided after the adoption of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, endorsed the concept that where a “disclosure request would pierce the veil of secrecy shielding the matters which occurred before the grand jury, the [request] must be denied unless an exception can be shown.” In re Young, 755 A.2d at 847. This language strongly indicates that only in those cases where an enumerated Rule 6(e) exception is applicable should the Superior Court consider whether disclosure is appropriate. However, In re Young dealt with the requests of the City of Providence and the estate of police Sergeant Cornel Young, Jr., to access materials from the grand jury that investigated the shooting and death of Sergeant Young by two fellow Providence police officers. Id. at 845. Both the city and the estate of Sergeant Young sought the information because the Sergeant’s estate had filed a notice of claim with the Providence City Council seeking significant damages and equitable relief, which carried the specter of a potential civil lawsuit. Id. at 845, 848. As was made clear in that case, the issue was whether disclosure was appropriate under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i). Id. at 846-48. As such, In re Young also provides little insight into disclosure requests that, like the Governor’s request, lie outside the reach of Rule 6. 12 Supreme Court also stated: “[A]ny disclosure of grand jury minutes is covered by Fed.Rules Crim. Proc. 6(e)[.]” Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, 360 U.S. at 398. 12', 'It is noteworthy that, as the Attorney General also points out, we have said that: “In construing Rule 6(e), courts begin with the ‘fundamental policy of grand jury secrecy.’” In re Doe, 717 A.2d 1129, 1134 (R.I. 1998) (quoting In re Grand Jury Investigation, 642 F.2d 1184, 1190 (9th Cir. 1981)). While true, that statement does not provide an answer to the question of whether the disclosures a court is permitted to make under Rule 6(e) are exhaustive or permissive. Significantly, the language of In re Doe is used by both the Governor and the Attorney General to support their respective positions. That is because in In re Doe, we also indicated that “the secrecy extended to grand jury proceedings is not absolute[,]” id., and that “[t]here is no per se rule against disclosure of any and all information which has reached the grand jury chambers.” Id. (quoting Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. United States Department of Justice, 823 F.2d 574, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). In any event, In re Doe is also of little guidance because it did not concern the question of under which circumstances a court can disclose grand jury material. Rather, it concerned whether notice to a patient that a subpoena had been issued by the grand jury for his', '- 22 -', 'The Governor, recognizing that the question before us is one of first impression for this Court, directs us to federal caselaw. She argues that “the great weight of federal cases” supports her contention that “the Superior Court has the inherent authority to disclose grand jury material outside the confines of Rule 6(e).”', 'Indeed, it is true that a number of federal appellate courts have concluded that the federal district courts have the inherent authority to disclose grand jury materials, even if those disclosures fall outside of the exceptions set out in Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. See Carlson, 837 F.3d at 767 (“The district courts retain certain inherent powers * * * . One such power relates to their supervision of the disclosure of grand-jury materials. * * * Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent power.”); United States v. Aisenberg, 358 F.3d 1327, 1347 (11th Cir. 2004) (“Although Rule 6(e)(3) enumerates the exceptions to the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy, the Supreme Court and this Court have recognized that the district courts have inherent power beyond the literal wording of Rule 6(e)(3) to disclose grand jury material and that Rule 6(e)(3) is but declaratory of that authority.”); In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997) (explaining that under federal Rule 6(e)(3), “district courts, as part of their supervisory authority over the grand juries that they have empaneled, are explicitly given the discretion to determine whether, if one or more of the listed exceptions to grand jury secrecy apply, disclosure of records is appropriate”; and also explaining that, because “Rule 6(e) * * * reflects rather than creates the relationship between federal courts and grand juries[,]” “there are certain ‘special medical records, a disclosure that was required by the Confidentiality of Health Care Communications and Information Act, violated Rule 6(e). Id. at 1130. We were not satisfied that the subpoena constituted “a matter occurring before the grand jury.” Id. at 1135 (brackets omitted) (quoting Super. R. Crim. P. 6(e)).', '- 23 - circumstances’ in which release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of the rule”).', 'However, the point of view that Rule 6(e)(3) can be circumvented is not unanimous. Last year, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that federal courts lack the “inherent authority” to authorize the disclosure of grand jury materials in circumstances not covered by the explicit exceptions in federal Rule 6(e). McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 844 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. denied, __ S. Ct. __ (Jan. 21, 2020). McKeever rejected the view articulated in the federal cases relied upon by the Governor, holding instead that “the district court has no [inherent] authority” “to disclose what we assume are historically significant grand jury matters.” Id.', 'After reviewing the competing and conflicting authority, and after carefully considering the thoughtful arguments of the opposing constitutional officers, we are confronted with the ultimate question: Does our Superior Court have the authority to disclose grand jury materials if that disclosure is not authorized by Rule 6(e)? Importantly, as we have in the past recognized, “the Superior Court is statutory in origin and derives its powers from statutes duly enacted by the Legislature.” State v. Briggs, 934 A.2d 811, 815 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. DiStefano, 764 A.2d 1156, 1167-68 (R.I. 2000)). That is to say, the Superior Court does not generally have the right to exercise “inherent authority,” and the Superior Court is not permitted to act outside of the mandates of a statute or, as in this case, court rule. Put another way, our general rule is: That which is not prescribed by statute or rule is forbidden—not that anything that is not expressly forbidden is permissible. See Drago Custom Interiors, LLC v. Carlisle Building Systems, Inc., 57 A.3d 668, 673-74 n.5 (R.I. 2012) (rejecting the notion that the Superior Court has “inherent authority to remand an arbitration award”); Briggs, 934 A.2d at 815, 816 (explaining that because “the', '- 24 - Legislature * * * has established an explicit statutory scheme for maintaining, handling, expunging, and sealing Bureau of Criminal Identification * * * records[,]” the Superior Court does not have authority to expunge records outside of that scheme); State v. Dearmas, 841 A.2d 659, 661-62 (R.I. 2004) (explaining that, where the General Assembly has created a statutory scheme for the issuance of search warrants, “the Superior Court does not possess any inherent authority” to go outside of that scheme to accomplish a seizure); see also State v. Manocchio, 743 A.2d 555, 557 (R.I. 2000) (“[D]espite the inherent supervisory power provided to Superior Court justices to govern proceedings before them and to vindicate their authority by appropriate sanctions, such supervisory power is limited by rules that are constitutionally authorized.”). 13 Therefore, we are constrained to answer the question in the negative: There is no inherent authority in the Superior Court to disclose grand jury materials beyond that which is permitted by the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 13', 'It is true that this Court has recognized certain inherent powers of the Superior Court, in particular those powers necessary for the Superior Court to vindicate its own authority. See Lett v. Providence Journal Company, 798 A.2d 355, 365 (R.I. 2002) (“[T]rial courts possess the inherent authority to protect their integrity by sanctioning any fraudulent conduct by litigants that is directed toward the court itself or its processes, as informed by the procedures and sanctions available to the court and to the parties under [the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure].”); State v. DiPrete, 710 A.2d 1266, 1275 (R.I. 1998) (“We concur with the general proposition that justices of the Superior Court have inherent power to govern proceedings before them and to vindicate their authority by appropriate sanctions including the sanction of contempt.”); Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 583-84, 370 A.2d 1262, 1265 (1977) (explaining that the Superior Court has inherent authority to revoke a defendant’s bail even though the Rules of Criminal Procedure provide other sanctions for breach of a condition and the General Assembly has not granted the Superior Court such authority, because “a court with jurisdiction over a criminal case has the power to enforce its orders as to bail just as it has control over other orders”). Another example of this kind of power is that of the trial justice “to sequester witnesses during trial testimony for the purpose of preventing that witness from shaping his or her testimony to conform to that of other witnesses.” State v. Perez, 882 A.2d 574, 583 (R.I. 2005). Other inherent powers of the Superior Court do exist; however, none of those are at all similar to the asserted inherent power here. See State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 479 (R.I. 2008) (“Courts have the inherent authority to review attorney contingent fee contracts in order to prevent unreasonableness.”).', '- 25 -', 'In reaching this conclusion, we harken back to our long-standing principles expressed in In re Opinion to the Governor, 62 R.I. 200, 4 A.2d 487 (1939), in which we said that: “One of [the grand jury’s] main purposes was to protect the rights of the individual citizen against possible oppression by the crown or its agencies in the prosecution of crimes[,]” In re Opinion to the Governor, 62 R.I. at 203, 4 A.2d at 488; and in In re Buxton, 111 R.I. 480, 304 A.2d 350 (1973), in which we endorsed the principle that “the grand jury was a shield which would protect an accused from governmental oppression[.]” In re Buxton, 111 R.I. at 482, 304 A.2d at 352. We are of the opinion that, as the history reflects, grand jury secrecy plays an integral part not only in the effective prosecution of crimes, but also in the protection of those upon whom the grand jury casts its considerable inquisitorial powers, which in turn is a protection potentially afforded to every member of the public. We decline to hold that the Superior Court has the authority to act as the Governor advocates. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'D', 'Did the Governor Present Special or Exceptional Circumstances?', 'In light of our conclusion that the Superior Court is not garbed with the inherent authority to disclose grand jury materials outside of Rule 6(e)(3), it is not necessary for us to consider the Governor’s arguments that the Superior Court erred in its alternative analyses. However, in view of the heightened public nature of the issues implicated by this case, and considering that the matter concerns a legal battle between two constitutional officers, we think it appropriate that we highlight that, even had we held that the Superior Court did have inherent authority to act as the Governor advocates, we would have had no hesitation in determining that it would have been well within the Presiding Justice’s discretion to deny the Governor’s petition. That is so because we are confident that even those courts that allow the release of grand jury material under special or', '- 26 - exceptional circumstances would not have granted the Governor’s petition. In fact, the cases the Governor urges upon us to support her argument, in which petitioners uninvolved in the underlying proceedings sought public disclosure of grand jury materials, differ starkly from this case.', 'In the vast majority of the cases offered by the Governor to support her argument, in which a court has publicly released grand jury material under special or exceptional circumstances, the subject of the grand jury was of unquestionably intense national historical interest; a significant amount of time—decades—had passed since the grand jury proceedings had closed; the disclosures were sought by historians; and the courts released but a limited amount of information. See Carlson, 837 F.3d at 756-57 (affirming disclosure of transcripts of witness testimony from grand jury that investigated newspaper’s publication of a 1942 article after the critical Battle of Midway on petition from historian who was writing a book about the article “more than 70 years later”); In re Pitch, 275 F.

We find it noteworthy that that decision relates to a petition which presented circumstances that are significantly different from the petition before us.

1,State : v. : Ricardo Franco. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. After a trial in Providence County Superior Court, a jury found the defendant, Ricardo Franco (defendant), guilty of three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.2. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in failing to grant a mistrial or to strike the complaining witness’s unexpected testimony and that the trial justice compounded the error by instructing the jury to disregard a portion of the complaining witness’s testimony. The defendant additionally argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 4, 2016, defendant was indicted on three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. At the trial conducted over five days in April and May 2018, the complaining witness testified as to events that allegedly took place between February 18, 2014, and June 2014. According to the complaining witness, defendant, whom she referred to as an uncle, sexually assaulted her by penetrating her vagina with his penis on about thirty separate', '-1- occasions; she specifically recounted three of the alleged incidents. Her testimony included graphic details of assaults inflicted upon her by defendant following defendant’s discovery that she had a boyfriend and defendant’s alleged statement that he “wasn’t going to allow [her] boyfriend to be the first person to be with [her].” The pertinent facts of the case are as follows.1', 'The complaining witness testified first.2 In November 2013, she moved to defendant’s home in Central Falls, where her father was already living along with defendant, defendant’s wife, and their infant child.3', 'She testified that her father, like her, had immigrated from Guatemala and that he worked every night from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m.', 'According to the complaining witness, the first two incidents of sexual molestation occurred after her father had gone to work for the night. She testified that, although defendant’s wife and infant child were home, the incidents took place in their small apartment while defendant’s wife was bathing their infant child, as indicated by the sound of running water. She testified that defendant stopped the assaults when the faucet was turned off. She further testified that she was afraid to speak up during and after the alleged assaults, because defendant threatened to have her father deported if she were to yell or scream out.', 'The third incident, according to the complaining witness, occurred after she and her father moved out of defendant’s house; she testified that defendant picked her up while she was walking home from school and took her back to his apartment, where the alleged assault occurred with only the infant child at home. The defendant then dropped her off a block from 1', 'For purpose of this opinion, a precise recitation of the sordid details of the acts allegedly committed by defendant is not necessary. Although there was significant testimony from the complaining witness as to the incidents that allegedly occurred, we do not deem it necessary to delve into the details. 2', 'The complaining witness testified that the alleged events occurred when she was between twelve and thirteen years of age. 3', 'The complaining witness testified that defendant was her uncle; however, he is in fact her father’s cousin, whom she refers to as an uncle.', '-2- her house, in order to avoid suspicion. Again, although her parents were home when she was dropped off by defendant, the complaining witness did not tell them what occurred “because they might do something, report him, and then he might do something to my parents and have them deported because they were both here now.”', 'The complaining witness testified that, after she moved out of defendant’s home with her parents, defendant had purchased a cell phone for her and sent her text messages on it, and she also stated that she would destroy the SIM cards and not respond to his messages. The text messages and cell phone were not offered into evidence.', 'The complaining witness also testified that she told her by then ex-boyfriend about the first alleged incident; however, she broke up with him shortly after because, according to her, defendant threatened to kill him. After being asked if she had told anyone else, the complaining witness testified, to the surprise of both the state and defense counsel, that she had disclosed the alleged assaults to a classmate. The testimony and the resulting objection were as follows:', '“[PROSECUTOR:] Did you ever tell anyone else about what', 'happened to you?', '“[COMPLAINING WITNESS:] No.', '“[PROSECUTOR:] At some point you did tell someone though;', 'correct?', '“[COMPLAINING WITNESS:] Yes.', '“[PROSECUTOR:] And who did you tell?', '“[COMPLAINING WITNESS:] One of my classmates, but she', 'didn’t believe me.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. May I be heard at sidebar,', 'your Honor?', '“THE COURT: Okay.”', '-3- The trial justice and the attorneys then went to the sidebar, where the following conversation occurred:', '“THE COURT: Before I rule, I want to make sure we’re * * * on', 'the same page.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: First and foremost, it’s a Rule 16', 'violation. We never had any sort of information, even hinting, that', 'she told anyone other than [her former boyfriend]. And the', 'prosecutor tied [sic] to elicit that information so she knew that was', 'coming. As far as that goes, it’s an unfair surprise. We could have', 'contacted that person and tried to talk to them and got other', 'information. So I would ask for a mistrial. If that is not granted,', 'we ask that it be stricken.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I never heard this either. I was trying', 'to get her to talk about when she disclosed to her parents. If you', 'want to look at my questions, I never knew she disclosed to anyone', 'else.', '“THE COURT: Before I rule on the objection, do you want to', 'move for a mistrial?', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, your Honor.', '“THE COURT: Okay. It’s denied. The prosecutor placed on the', 'record she did not have knowledge of that. The Court will allow', 'the statement that she told. As far as the response or how the', 'person felt, the Court is going to sustain that objection as not only', 'hearsay but also speculative and will instruct the jury to disregard.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, if she continues to make', 'any further statement about that, I would ask for a voir dire on that', 'of who the person is.', '“THE COURT: Okay.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: My next question was moving on to October.', '“THE COURT: Okay. Denied.” The sidebar concluded, and the trial justice immediately addressed the jury:', '“There was an objection on the last question. The jury can', 'consider as evidence the testimony of this witness told [sic] one of', '-4-', 'her classmates something, but the Court will sustain and instruct', 'the jury to disregard what her feeling was or what the reaction was', 'of this classmate.”', 'The complaining witness then testified in October 2015 that she finally told her parents about defendant’s actions after they discovered a belly-button piercing that she had undergone. She testified that her father also found her attempting to cut her hands with cutting blades. She further testified that when her father asked, in the presence of her mother, why she was doing that, she “couldn’t take it anymore and * * * told him everything that was happening.” According to the complaining witness, her parents then brought her to the police station, where she gave a statement to a detective. She testified that she was examined two weeks later at a children’s hospital. She additionally testified that her extended family in Guatemala did not believe her and that the people at the church she attended, where both her family and defendant’s family were members, were not supportive of her.', 'The complaining witness’s father, who also testified at trial, confirmed that defendant had given his daughter a phone, without her father’s knowledge, and that, when he confronted defendant, defendant told him that “he found it. Somebody had dropped it in the park.” The complaining witness’s father additionally testified that he found that to be “suspicious” because defendant had also been giving the complaining witness gifts, including expensive shoes and clothing, that were “not appropriate.”', 'After the complaining witness and her father testified, each party called an expert witness. The witness for the state, Christine Barron, M.D., was qualified as an expert in child-abuse pediatrics. Doctor Barron testified that she was an attending physician at the Aubin Center at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, a program that performs complete medical evaluations for all forms of child maltreatment. The doctor testified that she evaluated the complaining witness,', '-5- noted healed linear marks on her forearms consistent with self-inflicted cuts, and performed a genital and anal exam. According to Dr. Barron, the complaining witness’s genital exam was normal, meaning that there was no damage or injury visible on the tissue examined, including on the hymen tissue. She testified that “a normal exam neither rules out or confirms the possibility of sexual abuse or prior penetration and that is based upon my education, training, experience, and review of the literature where 90 to 95 percent of patients will have a normal exam despite having been sexually abused including vaginal penetration” and that “the number of penetrations does not change the findings and the diagnosis.” In testifying, she indicated that studies and peer-reviewed work supported her opinion, including a paper published in a lead peer-reviewed journal for the field of pediatrics, in which the author “followed and examined 36 adolescents who were pregnant and that of those patients only two of them had a finding on exam of an injury to the hymen.” She ultimately testified that, based on her evaluation, which included the history given by the complaining witness, her opinion was that the complaining witness had been sexually assaulted.', 'After the state rested, defendant called Alan Fine, M.D., who was qualified as an expert in obstetrics and gynecology.4 Doctor Fine testified that he was an obstetrician gynecologist, specializing in total care of women of all ages with respect to their reproductive organs. He testified that he reviewed the complaining witness’s medical information, which included a flash drive of physical-examination findings, a video of the exam, and a medical report.', 'After reviewing the information provided, Dr. Fine concluded that the exam was a “normal virginal hymen and external pelvic examination[,]” meaning that the hymen appeared intact. He further testified that he could not, in his own knowledge and experience, “remember in 35 years ever 4', 'In addition to the expert witness, a police detective and a friend testified for the defense. The testimony of those two witnesses is not pertinent to the issues on appeal.', '-6- seeing a patient who had penetrated intercourse 30 times with a completely intact hymen[.]” Doctor Fine cited no studies or peer-reviewed work to support his opinion. He additionally testified that he rarely examines patients who are between eleven and thirteen years old.', 'After the conclusion of evidence and closing arguments, the jury returned with a guilty verdict on all three counts of the indictment. The defendant then filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that (1) defense counsel should have been given the opportunity to interview the complaining witness’s classmate in view of discovery violations, due process issues, and confrontation clause problems related to the unexpected testimony by the complaining witness; and (2) the verdict was not supported by the weight of evidence, specifically with respect to the credibility of witnesses. After hearing from counsel for both sides, the trial justice explained that he found Dr. Barron, the state’s expert witness, to be “open, honest, and credible” and Dr. Fine, the defense’s expert witness, to be unconvincing and “not sufficiently experienced in terms of his opinions.” He additionally found the complaining witness to be credible, because “[s]he gave specific details as to each” incident of molestation and “she was very candid on both direct and cross-examination.” He also determined that, from his front-row seat at trial, he agreed with the jury’s verdict on all charges. Therefore, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'On June 29, 2018, the trial justice sentenced defendant to forty-five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with thirty years to serve and fifteen years suspended, with probation, on each of the three counts, to be served concurrently.', '-7-', 'A judgment of conviction was entered on July 26, 2018. The defendant had filed a premature but timely notice of appeal on May 9, 2018.5', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion for a Mistrial and Motion to Strike', 'On appeal, defendant submits that the trial justice erred in failing to grant a mistrial or to strike the complaining witness’s entire unexpected testimony that she had disclosed the sexual assaults to “[o]ne of [her] classmates, but she didn’t believe [her].” He asserts that the trial justice compounded the error by instructing the jury to only disregard that portion of the testimony indicating that her classmate did not believe her, but allowing as evidence the testimony that she had told one of her classmates something.', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“The decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial belongs to the trial justice, and this Court gives great weight to his or her sound discretion.” State v.

Therefore, this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s grant or denial of a motion to strike unless that ruling was clearly erroneous. See id. at 216.', '2', 'Analysis', 'We start by noting that there was no indication that the disclosure at issue was known to the state in advance of the complaining witness’s testimony. Without further guidance from the attorneys, the trial justice summarily denied the motion for a mistrial and granted, in part, the alternative motion to strike. He indicated that he was sustaining the motion to strike with respect to a portion of the testimony as hearsay. At that point defendant did not seek a ruling based on a Rule 16 analysis, or in any way object to the trial justice’s determination. By failing to do so, defendant waived his argument as to the denial of the motion for a mistrial and partial denial of the motion to strike.6 See State v. Padilla, 171 A.3d 976, 982 (R.I. 2017) (“It is well settled that a 6', 'We also note that defense counsel used the complaining witness’s testimony regarding the classmate in her closing argument to label the complaining witness as a “gossip girl[,]” to point out inconsistencies in the complaining witness’s testimony, and to point out that the complaining witness had not told the police that she had told her classmate about the assaults.', '-9- litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Additionally, we hold that defendant waived his contention that the trial justice compounded the alleged error by instructing the jury to disregard the complaining witness’s testimony that her classmate did not believe her. This Court has said that “a failure to object to a jury instruction precludes review of the instruction on appeal.” State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1007 (R.I. 2005) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 795 (R.I. 2004)). Our review of the record reveals that defense counsel never objected to the instruction given to the jury regarding that testimony. Instead, defense counsel’s focus was on any further possible statement by the complaining witness on the topic, and the request for voir dire as to the identity of the classmate if that were to occur again. “This Court requires a specific objection at trial, to ensure that the trial justice has knowledge of the allegation of error and can ‘have an opportunity to rule on it.’” State v. Romero, 193 A.3d 1167, 1172 (R.I. 2018) (quoting State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013)). Nothing in the transcript suggests that defense counsel took issue with the instruction or that the trial justice was aware of any issue defense counsel may have had, aside from the concern about possible future statements regarding the complaining witness confiding in her classmate.', 'As such, we conclude that defendant’s argument alleging an error regarding the instruction to the jury is waived.', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.

At the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the trial justice indicated that he found the testimony of the complaining witness to be “credible” because of the specific details she provided. He noted that he was troubled by her testimony regarding the cell phone and the destruction of SIM cards, but that ultimately “the [c]ourt must look at that one area of testimony in light of all of the testimony” of the complaining witness. He therefore found that her testimony was “sufficient to sustain [a] finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Although the trial justice did not go through each individual piece of evidence in his bench decision, it is clear to this Court that he exercised his independent judgment as to the credibility of the complaining witness and the weight of the evidence in rendering his decision. See State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010) (“In providing a rationale for a decision, however, the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision but need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this Court to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.”) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v.

We disagree. When he ruled on the motion for a new trial, the trial justice “articulated sufficient reasoning in support of” denying the motion. See Silvia, 197 A.3d at 1291. He assessed the experience of the expert witnesses and their credibility, ultimately deciding that “Dr. Barron was open, honest, and credible[,]” and that Dr. Fine had limited experience with adolescents and, based on his testimony, did not seem to be “sufficiently experienced in terms of his opinions.”', 'Furthermore, unlike Dr. Barron, who', '- 12 - presented scholarly work to support her opinion, Dr. Fine relied upon his own experience alone, without basis in scientific studies, in drawing his conclusion.

He further testified that, in 2006, NESC distributed Maxxon products, which are gypsum-based flooring products.', 'Mr. Petronio also testified that Bacon asked NESC to submit a bid to install flooring at the RIC project and that it provided NESC with the contract drawings. He testified that Robinson Green Beretta, the architectural firm on the project, was seeking the installation of a specific type of acoustic Maxxon flooring composed of two products: (1) Dura-Cap, a type of base layer; and (2) WearTop, a type of finished flooring. Mr. Petronio also testified that, when Bacon first provided NESC with the bid documents, it was NESC’s understanding that the project was to be completed by the Spring of 2007, in anticipation of the dormitory opening for students in the Fall semester. He stated that NESC submitted its first bid to Bacon in January of 2006 based on an estimate that 92,000 square feet of flooring would be needed; he added that Bacon did not accept that first bid. Mr. Petronio further testified that Bacon later asked NESC to submit a revised bid based on 91,430 square feet, and that NESC did so on July 26, 2006. He stated that Bacon did not accept the revised bid either.', 'It was further Mr. Petronio’s testimony that, on April 10, 2007, NESC sent a fax to Bacon addressed to Rick Reuter, an employee of Bacon,4 which fax consisted of yet another bid and a fax cover sheet stating that “it looks like the only variable at this point is an agreed to square footage.” The fax containing the new bid and the cover sheet was admitted as an exhibit at trial. The just- referenced bid included a range of square footage for both Dura-Cap and WearTop. According to Mr. Petronio, the high and low points of the range of square footage were derived from Bacon’s estimate of 88,800 square feet and NESC’s estimate of 96,329 square feet. Mr. Petronio also testified that, on the same date, he had a discussion with Mr. Reuter, in the course of which 4', 'Rick Reuter’s role is discussed more fully in Part I.B.2, infra.', '-4- discussion they agreed that, in order to resolve the difference in the square footage estimates, “[they] could get a third party to digitize the plans” and that “Mr. Reuter agree[d] to submit the plans to Civil Takeoffs[5] * * *.”', 'Mr. Petronio next testified that, after making an adjustment at Bacon’s request concerning an item that is not material to the instant dispute, he faxed NESC’s final bid to Bacon on April 11, 2007 and included therein the same range of square footage as he had included in the previous bid. He testified that Bacon accepted this bid and proceeded to generate a contract. Mr. Petronio testified that he received the proposed contract from Bacon on April 16, 2007. He further testified that the proposed contract included the same range of square footage as was set forth in NESC’s final bid. Mr. Petronio stated that, after Wayne Capolupo (the owner of NESC) signed the contract without making any alterations to the range of square footage, the contract was faxed back to Bacon on April 18, 2007. According to Mr. Petronio’s testimony, when NESC signed the contract, it was not “prepared to do the job and perform the work on the contract on a square footage less than 88,800 square feet[.]” He testified that, one day after returning the signed contract to Bacon, employees of NESC arrived on the job site and started working.', 'Mr. Petronio then testified that, on May 3, 2007, he received a fax from Mr. Reuter with a cover sheet that stated: “Here is a copy of your signed subcontract agreement. Please note the few markups made. Call with any questions.” He went on to describe a note which appeared to him to have been written by Michael Bahry, the vice president of operations for Bacon, and which stated: “Actual price will be determined by actual quantity supplied by Civil Takeoffs, LLC, attached.” Mr. Petronio testified that this note was added by Bacon. He further testified that the 5', 'According to Mr. Petronio’s testimony, Civil Takeoffs is a third-party company that had previously performed work digitizing plans.', '-5- figure of 88,800 square feet used in the contract was crossed out and replaced with the number 83,318. Mr. Petronio acknowledged that 83,318 was the amount of square footage determined by Civil Takeoffs.', 'It was Mr. Petronio’s testimony that, after receiving the May 3, 2007 fax, he immediately called Mr. Reuter and “told him [he] didn’t think the number was correct.” He added that he had told Mr. Reuter that he “couldn’t do it for the eighty-[three6] three” because he “would end up losing money doing it.” He then testified that Mr. Reuter said “what if we do an as-built[?] At the end of the job, we will measure up the rooms.” Mr. Petronio stated that he rejected Mr. Reuter’s suggestion, but said “what I will agree to is your original number of 88,800 square feet.” He then testified that Mr. Reuter agreed to use the 88,800 square feet number. According to Mr. Petronio’s testimony, Mr. Reuter did not qualify his agreement to using that number by saying that he needed to obtain permission from either George Agostini, the owner of Bacon, or Michael Bahry, the purchasing agent for Bacon. Mr. Petronio further testified that, immediately after his phone conversation with Mr. Reuter, he wrote on the fax cover sheet “Called Rick. Agreed to use Bacon number 88,800 square feet.” He also testified that he had believed that Mr. Reuter had authority as executive manager of Bacon to make that agreement.', 'Mr. Petronio testified that, following this agreement, there were no further written agreements exchanged between the parties. He stated that NESC continued working on the project after the May 3, 2007 conversation and that NESC completed the project by the end of July 2007. Mr. Petronio further testified that NESC made three payment applications to Bacon, each 6', 'Although the transcript of Mr. Petronio’s testimony indicates that he said he “couldn’t do it for the eighty-eight three,” it is clear from the context that he was actually referring to the 83,318 square feet figure.', '-6- application being based on the 88,800 square footage figure. He stated that Bacon paid the first two payment applications in full, but that the final payment application was not paid.', '2', 'The Testimony of Richard Reuter', 'Next, NESC called Richard Reuter as an adverse witness. Mr. Reuter testified that he had been an employee of Bacon since 1994. He testified that Bacon is owned by George Agostini and is a general contractor “involved in the business of constructing schools and facilities for universities * * *.” Mr. Reuter also testified that he was employed as an executive manager at Bacon when Bacon was engaged in the bidding process for subcontracts for the project at RIC. He stated that, as executive manager, he had authority to sign contracts. He further testified that Bacon and NESC negotiated from approximately January of 2006 until April of 2007 regarding a subcontract to install a Maxxon acoustical flooring system, but that he did not become personally involved until the Spring of 2007. Mr. Reuter stated that, at the time when he became involved with the project, Michael Bahry was handling purchasing. He also admitted that Bacon was “getting pressure to get [the] flooring contract designed * * *.”', 'Mr. Reuter further testified that Mr. Bahry had drafted the contract that Bacon faxed to NESC on April 16, 2007, which contract specified a range of square footage between 88,800 and 96,329. He testified that Bacon received a fax of the contract signed by Mr. Capolupo on April 18, 2007. Mr. Reuter testified that, while he was not aware that the parties had agreed to use a third party to determine the actual square footage, “[his] understanding [wa]s that [the parties] put that range in the contract to get work to proceed, knowing there wasn’t an agreement, and that the two companies would come to an agreement on the square footage at some point.” He also testified', '-7- that, “at the time the contract was sent out,” his understanding “was that at a minimum, based on that arrangement, the square footage was going to be 88,800 square feet * * *.”', 'It was also Mr. Reuter’s testimony that, after Civil Takeoffs sent its report to Bacon, Bacon revised the contract. He stated that Mr. Bahry marked up the contract, crossed out the 88,800 square feet figure, and replaced it with 83,318 square feet—the number arrived at by Civil Takeoffs. Mr. Reuter testified that he signed the revised contract and faxed it to Mr. Petronio on May 3, 2007. According to Mr. Reuter’s testimony, Mr. Petronio called him after receiving the fax and expressed his disagreement with Bacon’s changes. Mr. Reuter admitted that, during this phone conversation, he asked Mr. Petronio if he would accept 88,800 as the final quantity of square footage, and Mr. Petronio agreed. Mr. Reuter then clarified his testimony, stating that, “as a company,” he never agreed to use 88,800 as a final number, but that he had personally agreed to do so. He testified that he was agreeable to going forward with the 88,800 figure, but he added that “[he] said [he] would have to go to George Agostini and Michael Bahry to confirm that.”', 'According to Mr. Reuter’s testimony, he spoke with Mr. Agostini and Mr. Bahry about using 88,800 square feet, and they did not accept that figure. He further testified that he then “informed Tony [Petronio] that the agreement for eight eighty-eight that [he] had between him [sic] was not good.” Mr. Reuter then stated that, “[a]s far as requisition, we still used eight eighty- eight, I believe.” He also testified that the parties “had talked about doing the joint survey between the companies,” but he admitted that “there was no agreement on that actual final survey * * *.”', 'When asked about when Bacon performed an as-built survey to determine the square footage of the Maxxon flooring actually installed, Mr. Reuter testified that it was not performed until a few months prior to the date of his testimony at trial in October of 2017. Mr. Reuter also', '-8- testified that, in December of 2007, several months after NESC completed the flooring project, Bacon submitted a change order to RIC requesting a credit based on a figure of 88,000 square feet.', '3', 'The Testimony of George Agostini', 'Bacon presented four witnesses at trial. First to testify on Bacon’s behalf was George Agostini, who testified that he had been the president of Bacon since 1984. Mr. Agostini testified that Bacon signed the general contract with RIC in February of 2006. He testified that RIC and the architect on the project wanted to use the Dura-Cap flooring product, but that Bacon did not want to do so. He further testified that the subcontract with NESC was signed in April of 2007, but he stated that he was not involved in the conversations leading up to that agreement.', 'It was further Mr. Agostini’s testimony regarding Mr. Reuter’s role that “[o]ur project managers do not negotiate contracts” and that contract negotiating was the responsibility of Mr. Bahry, as vice president. He stated that project managers “were given the power to be able to sign [contracts]. But it was with approval from Michael Bahry.” Mr. Agostini testified that he and Mr. Bahry discussed the markups Mr. Bahry had made to the agreement signed by NESC, specifically using the 83,318 square footage figure from Civil Takeoffs. When asked if Mr. Bahry and/or Mr. Reuter ever discussed with him “accepting a lump sum square foot amount of 88,800,” he testified that they had, but that he did not authorize using 88,800 square feet. On cross-examination, Mr. Agostini admitted that he gave Mr. Reuter authority to sign the subcontract “[w]ith Michael Bahry, with all the markups.”', '-9-', '4', 'The Testimony of Michael Bahry', 'The next witness to testify was Michael Bahry, who testified that he had been employed at Bacon for a total of seventeen years. He stated that he was the vice president of operations for most of that time and that part of his role in that position was to serve as head of purchasing. He further stated that, in 2007, he was involved in the dormitory construction project at RIC. Mr. Bahry testified that he received the final bid from NESC and used it to draft the subcontract that was faxed to NESC on April 16, 2007, which NESC signed and returned with markups on April 18, 2007.', 'Mr. Bahry then testified that, after receiving the signed, marked-up subcontract from NESC, Mr. Reuter “mentioned possibly converting the contract to a fixed sum because NESC had appealed to him to do so.” He testified that he told Mr. Reuter that he did not want to do that “[b]ecause the estimate that came back from NESC’s estimator was lower than the lower number in the contract, which was odd.” Mr. Bahry also testified that he told Mr. Reuter that he had concerns about committing to a number higher than the estimate because “it could possibly at the end even be lower than that number * * *.”', 'It was further Mr. Bahry’s testimony that, on April 18, 2007, after receiving the returned contract from NESC which still included a range for square footage, he expected that the “[square footage] would be quantified at the end of the job by the exact amount of product that was put down.” He also testified that he had a discussion with Mr. Reuter in which he “strongly suggested that’s how we do it because [he] thought that was the most just way to determine what the contract should be.” Mr. Bahry testified that he had a similar conversation with “someone from NESC but [he did not] recall who that was,” after the parties received the estimate generated by Civil', '- 10 - Takeoffs, during which conversation “[they] both kind of laughed about it a little bit, because you wouldn’t expect their number to come back lower than the range that was in the contract.” He further stated that he suggested to this individual that the parties do a field measurement at the end of the job and that the individual thought that this suggestion was fair; but he added that the contract was never modified to that effect.', 'Mr. Bahry testified that the agreement which he marked up and Bacon faxed to NESC on May 3, 2007 was the “last written expression of the parties * * *.” On cross-examination, Mr. Bahry testified that Mr. Reuter had authority to sign the contract “[a]fter he had approval from someone in the office,” but he stated that he could not recall having approved of Mr. Reuter’s signing the just-referenced contract.', '5', 'The Testimony of David DeQuattro', 'The next witness on behalf of Bacon was David DeQuattro, who testified that he was the managing principal of Robinson Green Beretta. Mr. DeQuattro testified that he was involved with the RIC dormitory project in 2007. He stated that his duties included overseeing all of the drawings and specifications. Mr. DeQuattro further testified that the floor plans identified what types of flooring and finishes were to be installed in each room. He also testified that a dispute arose regarding the areas where the Maxxon products (both Dura-Cap and WearTop) were actually installed. Mr. DeQuattro further testified that he “assigned Mr. Beretta the responsibility to go out and verify condition as-built versus what’s on the plans as far as size and materials.”', '- 11 -', '6', 'The Testimony of Richard Beretta', 'Lastly, Richard Beretta testified on behalf of Bacon. He provided that he was a self- employed general contractor who was asked by Mr. DeQuattro to “measure[] as an as-built” the dormitory at RIC. Specifically, he testified that he was hired in June of 2017 to measure the square footage of the interior spaces of the building and to conduct a field survey of the Maxxon flooring system. Mr. Beretta testified that, after conducting the survey, he created a narrative report for Robinson Green Beretta reflecting the results. On cross-examination, Mr. Beretta testified that his report indicated that 89,250 square feet of Dura-Cap were installed and that 74,691 square feet of WearTop were installed.', 'C', 'The Verdict and Bacon’s Motion for a New Trial', 'On November 2, 2017, after both parties had rested, the trial justice instructed the jury on a variety of topics, including the apparent authority of an agent, the required elements of a contract, breach of contract, damages, and unjust enrichment. Neither party objected to these instructions. On the same date, the jury returned its verdict. In response to the first interrogatory (“Did the parties agree to the square footage of the flooring installation?”), the jury answered, “Yes.” In response to the second and third interrogatories (“What is the square footage that was agreed upon with respect to Duracap?” and “What is the square footage that was agreed upon with respect to Weartop?”), the jury answered “88,800” as to both. The jury awarded NESC $125,733.67 in damages.', 'On November 14, 2017, Bacon filed a “Motion for New Trial Pursuant to Rule 59, or in the Alternative, Remittitur,” asserting that the verdict “failed to respond truly to the merits of the', '- 12 - case or to administer substantial justice between the parties, and is against the fair preponderance of the evidence.” On December 18, 2017, after reviewing the written submissions of the parties and conducting a hearing, the trial justice rendered a bench decision denying Bacon’s motion for a new trial and its alternative request for a remittitur. An order entered to that effect on January 3, 2018, and Bacon appealed.

Ritacco, 204 A.3d 597, 602 (R.I. 2019).

However, on February 7, 2018, NESC filed a second notice of appeal, cross-appealing from Bacon’s appeal from the denial of its motion for a new trial. Thus, any defect in NESC’s first appeal was rectified by the filing of the second appeal.', 'We also note that, following an order from this Court remanding the case to Superior Court for entry of final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, NESC filed a motion for separate and final judgment as to all claims between NESC and Bacon. An order entered on February 11, 2019 granting NESC’s motion, and separate and final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) entered on March 18, 2019. At oral argument, the parties represented that NESC’s insurer bad faith claim is still pending before the Superior Court.

See Bajakian, 880 A.2d at 852. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial justice properly performed her role as a “super juror” by evaluating the evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and, accordingly, using those findings as a basis for concluding that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the parties agreed to use 88,800 square feet as a final quantity for the contract.', '- 15 -', 'The trial justice focused her review primarily on the testimony of Mr. Petronio and Mr. Reuter. She found that both witnesses offered “self-serving testimony that contradicted earlier positions taken by each of them.” As to Mr. Petronio, the trial justice noted that his testimony was inconsistent with NESC’s sworn answers to interrogatories which provided that it was Mr. Petronio who first suggested using an as-built measurement during the phone conversation with Mr. Reuter, and that there was “no meeting of the minds on square footage.” As to Mr. Reuter, the trial justice found that in Mr. Reuter’s deposition, unlike what he stated in his in-court testimony, he made no mention of his agreement to use the 88,800 square feet figure as being contingent upon approval from Mr. Agostini. The trial justice also noted that Mr. Reuter stated in his deposition that the measurement “ended up being 88,800 square feet,” which testimony was inconsistent with Bacon’s position at trial. Further, the trial justice found that both Mr. Petronio and Mr. Reuter “downplay[ed] the grant of authority from the principals of their respective companies.”', 'Despite finding neither witness fully credible, the trial justice stated that “what was unquestionable were two events which * * * tended to corroborate that there had been an agreement to use the 88,800 square foot figure as plaintiffs contend.” The first event noted by the trial justice was “Bacon’s request for a credit based on the 88,000 square feet of flooring * * * as set forth in a change order dated December 21, 2007 * * *.” The second event was the fact that “Bacon finally got an as-built survey completed ten years after the flooring was installed.”', 'In her decision, the trial justice found that “the meeting of the minds and the use of the 88,800 square foot figure was reached orally, in a phone call after Petronio rejected the use of Civil Takeoffs’[s] lower figure of 83,318.” The trial justice then found that “reasonable minds could differ in determining if it was more likely than not that there was an agreement to use 88,800', '- 16 - square feet as the actual number for calculating the contract price,” and she denied Bacon’s motion for a new trial on NESC’s breach of contract claim on that basis. Based on the same reasoning, the trial justice denied Bacon’s motion for a new trial on its own counterclaim for breach of contract.', 'We fail to perceive any basis for concluding that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.', 'The trial justice acknowledged inconsistencies within the testimonies of Mr. Petronio and Mr. Reuter, but ultimately concluded that the evidence supported the jury’s finding in favor of NESC. As we have previously recognized, inconsistencies within the testimony of a witness “do[] not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012). It is the duty of the fact-finder to take such inconsistencies into account without necessarily giving them dispositive weight. Moreover, the court is free to accept some but not all portions of a witness’s testimony. See King v. Huntress, 94 A.3d 467, 495 (R.I. 2014) (recognizing that a fact-finder has the right “to pick and choose from [a witness’s] testimony what portions he [or she] deems worthy of belief”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Rhode Island Consumers’ Council v. Smith, 111 R.I. 271, 295-96, 302 A.2d 757, 772 (1973).', 'Additionally, since it is our view that the trial justice did not err in finding that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the parties agreed to use 88,800 square feet as a firm quantity, it was appropriate for her to reject Bacon’s argument that the jury improperly converted a unit-price contract into a lump-sum contract. Similarly, we see no error in the trial justice’s finding that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Mr. Reuter had apparent authority to bind Bacon to the agreement to use the 88,800 square feet figure. Notably, Mr. Reuter, as executive manager for Bacon, signed the agreement faxed to Mr. Petronio on May 3, 2007, which replaced the 88,800 square footage figure with 83,318, and included a note on the fax cover sheet telling Mr. Petronio', '- 17 - to call him if he had any questions. Moreover, the trial justice found that Mr. Reuter’s testimony regarding his lack of authority to agree to use the 88,800 square feet figure was lacking in credibility. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not clearly err, nor did she overlook or misconceive material evidence in denying Bacon’s motion for a new trial.', 'With regard to Bacon’s request for a remittitur, the trial justice found that the damages award comported with the evidence presented at trial. Because the jury’s award was simply based on a calculation of the agreed-to price per square foot of $10.69 multiplied by the quantity that the jury found the parties had agreed upon (88,800 square feet), we agree with the trial justice’s conclusion that “[t]he award in no way shocks the conscience nor does it clearly appear to be excessive or represent the passion and prejudice of the jury.” Thus, the trial justice appropriately denied Bacon’s request for a remittitur.', 'B', 'NESC’s Motion to Amend and Motion to Reconsider', 'We begin by noting that NESC has not provided us with transcripts of hearings regarding its August 4, 2014 motion to amend or its September 9, 2016 motion to reconsider the denial of its motion to amend.

3,Esther Yanku : v. : Walgreen Co. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In this slip-and-fall case, the plaintiff, Esther Yanku, an eighty-three-year-old woman, tripped over a speed bump in the parking lot of a Walgreens Pharmacy, sustaining injuries. The plaintiff sued the defendants, Walgreen Co. and Walgreen Eastern Co., Inc. (Walgreens), the tenant of the property, and the owners and landlords, Jean Farmanian-Ricci and Joan Frattarelli, Co-Trustees of the Revocable Trust of Armen N. Farmanian (the landlords) (collectively defendants), alleging several counts, including negligence, premises liability, and vicarious liability.', 'The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on December 3, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and having reviewed the memoranda filed by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'At approximately 6 p.m. on December 31, 2013, plaintiff drove her vehicle into the parking lot of the Walgreens Pharmacy located at 1010 Park Avenue in Cranston, Rhode Island. Although plaintiff had a handicapped parking pass, the parking lot was busy, so she parked in the first available parking space and began walking toward the entrance. Before she reached the store, she tripped over a yellow speed bump in the parking lot. The plaintiff filed a six-count complaint against defendants, alleging two counts of negligence based on premises liability, one count of vicarious liability, one count of negligent training and supervision, one count of negligent hiring and retention, and one count of negligent failure to exercise ordinary care.', 'During discovery, defendants propounded interrogatories and deposed plaintiff. In her answers to interrogatories, plaintiff stated that she “saw a number of yellow lines on the parking lot surface[,]” but “did not realize that one of the yellow lines was the speed bump.” The plaintiff also stated: “I did not see anything that would have put me on notice that there was a speed bump or that the parking lot surface was raised in that area. There were too many yellow lines.”', 'During plaintiff’s deposition, she stated that she did not recall driving over a speed bump when she entered the parking lot, nor did she notice the speed bump before she fell. According to plaintiff, she “wasn’t sure it was a bump, because [she] thought it was one of those yellow parking spot lines, because it was yellow and [she] was just walking.” The plaintiff also stated that she had previously been to that Walgreens Pharmacy on numerous occasions. When asked if she had noticed the speed bump in the parking lot on any previous occasions, she responded: “I must have.”', '-2-', 'The defendants filed motions for summary judgment under Rule 56(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.1 After a hearing on the motions, the trial justice, in a bench decision, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants based on her finding that plaintiff “fail[ed] to provide any direct or circumstantial evidence that would give rise to a reasonable inference that a hazardous condition existed on the premises.”2 On October 20, 2018, the trial justice entered an order granting defendants’ motions for summary judgment as well as a final judgment in favor of defendants. The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal on November 1, 2018.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Ballard v. SVF Foundation, 181 A.3d 27, 34 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 1', 'Rule 56(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides: “A party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for summary judgment in the party’s favor as to all or any part thereof.” 2', 'We pause to note that, in July 2019, the General Assembly amended G.L. 1956 § 9-20-4 to provide that an open and obvious danger will no longer act as a complete bar to recovery for plaintiffs in personal injury actions. The amended provision is as follows:', '“In all actions hereafter brought for personal injuries, or where', 'personal injuries have resulted in death, or for injury to property,', 'the fact that the person injured, or the owner of the property or', 'person having control over the property, may not have been in the', 'exercise of due care or the fact that the danger or defect was open', 'and obvious shall not bar a recovery, but damages shall be', 'diminished by the finder of fact in proportion to the amount of', 'negligence attributable to the person injured, or the owner of the', 'property or the person having control over the property.” Section', '9-20-4 (emphasis added). The act also provided that “the ‘open and obvious’ amendment shall only apply to personal injuries or personal injuries that have resulted in death or injury to property that occur after [July 15, 2019].” Because plaintiff’s alleged injuries in the present case occurred before the amendment went into effect, it is not available to this litigant.', '-3- 2013)). “Examining the case from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the judgment.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Sullo, 68 A.3d at 406-07). “Although summary judgment is recognized as an extreme remedy, to avoid summary judgment the burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that proves the existence of a disputed issue of material fact.” Id. (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting Sullo, 68 A.3d at 407). “In the absence of a credible showing of the existence of material facts, summary judgment is warranted.” Id.', 'Analysis', 'The issue on appeal is whether the speed bump presented a dangerous condition on the premises or, in the alternative, was an “open and obvious” danger. The plaintiff posits a rather novel argument that a speed bump is a per se inherently dangerous condition and can only constitute an open and obvious danger if it is properly designed, maintained, and marked with warning signs. The plaintiff submits that the speed bump was negligently constructed and maintained because it was painted the same color as the lines for the individual parking spaces in the parking lot, and because the parking lot was not properly illuminated. In any event, plaintiff contends that the issue of whether the speed bump was a dangerous condition was a genuine issue of material fact that should have been resolved by a jury rather than by the trial justice.', 'The defendants counter that the trial justice did not err in granting summary judgment in their favor because plaintiff failed to produce competent evidence to establish that the speed bump presented an unreasonable danger or that it was negligently constructed and maintained. The landlords proffer an additional argument based on their status as the commercial landlords of', '-4- the property. The landlords acknowledge that commercial landlords in Rhode Island owe a duty of care to their tenant’s invitees in limited circumstances, but they argue that, because none of those circumstances apply in this case, they did not owe plaintiff a duty of care.', 'We begin with the landlords’ argument that, based on their status as commercial landlords of the property, they did not owe plaintiff a duty of care. In Rhode Island, it is well settled that “a commercial landlord owes a duty of care to an invitee of its tenant only under the narrowest of circumstances[.]” E.g., Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009)). A commercial landlord “is not liable for injuries that the tenant’s invitee suffers on the leased premises, unless the injury results from the landlord’s breach of a covenant to repair in the lease, or from a latent defect known to the landlord but not known to the tenant or guest, or because the landlord subsequently has assumed the duty to repair.” Id. (quoting Holley, 968 A.2d at 274).', 'The plaintiff failed to prove that any of the three exceptions apply in this case. The lease agreement between Walgreens and the landlords does not contain a covenant requiring the landlords to repair the parking lot.3 Rather, the tenant, Walgreens, is required to maintain and 3', 'Section 7(a) of the lease between Walgreens and the landlords, entitled “Parking,” provides, in part:', '“Tenant shall, from time to time during the Term of this Lease', 'maintain, repair, remove snow and ice from, stripe, light and clean', 'the above mentioned parking areas and other facilities.” Section 10(a) of the lease, entitled “Repairs, Conformity with the Law,” provides, in part:', '“Tenant shall repair and replace heating and cooling equipment', 'serving only the building on the Leased Premises, shall make plate', 'glass replacements unless required by fault of Landlord, and shall', 'make repairs to the interior of the Leased Premises all except as', 'provided below. Landlord shall maintain and make all repairs to', 'the exterior and structural portions of the building, roof, and to', '-5- repair the parking lot. The landlords are responsible only for repairing and maintaining the exterior and structural portions of the building and for repairs caused by either the fault of the landlords “or by fire, casualty or the elements, or by dry rot or termites.” Moreover, plaintiff did not produce any competent evidence to establish that the speed bump was a latent defect known to the landlords but unknown to plaintiff. See Bromaghim v. Furney, 808 A.2d 615, 617 (R.I. 2002) (“In cases involving a latent defect, the plaintiff must prove that ‘sufficient evidence existed to show that the [commercial landlords] knew or should have known of an unsafe condition on their premises.’”) (quoting Massart v. Toys R Us, Inc., 708 A.2d 187, 189 (R.I. 1998)). The plaintiff also failed to produce any competent evidence that the landlords assumed a duty to repair the parking lot. Thus, we conclude that the trial justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of the landlords because plaintiff did not produce competent evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the landlords owed plaintiff a duty of care. See Berard, 64 A.3d at 1219.', 'We now turn to whether the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Walgreens. In opposing a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must “produce competent evidence that establishes a genuine issue of material fact.” Voccola v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Company, LLC, 209 A.3d 558, 561 (R.I. 2019). In a slip-and-fall case, one of the threshold inquiries is whether the plaintiff produced evidence of a dangerous condition “on the premises of which the defendant was aware or should have been aware, and that the condition existed for a long enough time [that] the owner of the premises should have taken steps to correct the condition.” Id. at 560-61 (quoting Bromaghim, 808 A.2d at 617). So, at a summary judgment', 'pipes, ducts, wires and conduits leading to and from the building', 'on the Leased Premises. Landlord shall make all repairs required', 'by causes the fault of Landlord, or by fire, casualty or the', 'elements, or by dry rot or termites.”', '-6- hearing in a slip-and-fall case, the plaintiff must “present evidence that [his or] her fall was the result of an unseen danger[.]” Id. at 561.', 'The trial justice in this case determined that plaintiff failed to provide any direct or circumstantial evidence that would give rise to a reasonable inference that a dangerous condition existed on the premises. We review a trial justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine if the nonmoving party produced competent evidence of a disputed issue of material fact. Ballard, 181 A.3d at 34. Our task has been made more difficult in this case, however, due to plaintiff’s failure to order the transcript from the hearing on the motions for summary judgment.', 'Article I, Rule 10(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure requires the appellant to “order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant deems necessary for inclusion in the record.” We have stated that the deliberate decision to prosecute an appeal without providing the Court with a transcript of the trial court proceedings is risky business. Mills v. C.H.I.L.D., Inc., 837 A.2d 714, 719 (R.I. 2003). “Unless the appeal is limited to a challenge to rulings of law that appear sufficiently on the record and the party accepts the findings of the trial justice as correct, the appeal must fail.” Id. (quoting 731 Airport Associates, LP v. H & M Realty Associates, LLC, 799 A.2d 279, 282 (R.I. 2002)).', 'The plaintiff’s failure to order the transcript of the summary judgment hearing is fatal to her appeal because it is impossible to conduct a meaningful review of this case; the parties’ arguments at the summary judgment hearing are unknown, and the trial justice did not issue a written decision. Compare Mills, 837 A.2d at 719 (explaining that the plaintiff’s failure to order the transcript was fatal to her appeal because the trial justice’s reasoning was unknown); with', '-7- 731 Airport Associates, 799 A.2d at 282 (allowing the appeal to proceed despite the plaintiff’s failure to order the transcripts because the trial justice issued a written decision and the plaintiff accepted the factual findings of the trial justice on appeal).', 'Notwithstanding, the record is also devoid of any affidavits or expert testimony supporting plaintiff’s argument that the speed bump constituted a dangerous condition. The plaintiff’s allegation that the speed bump was a dangerous condition, without more, is not competent evidence of a dangerous condition on the premises; rather, it “is nothing more than ‘conjecture or speculation.’” Habershaw v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1277 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Santiago v. First Student, Inc., 839 A.2d 550, 552 (R.I. 2004)). Again, “[w]e reiterate that ‘the mere occurrence of an accident, without more, does not warrant an inference that a defendant has been negligent.’” Id. (quoting Santiago, 839 A.2d at 552).', 'Thus, after a careful review of the record and the papers submitted by the parties, and without the ability to review the transcript to determine what the parties argued at the summary judgment hearing, we are constrained to conclude that the trial justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of Walgreens.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, the Town of Barrington (the Town), appeals from the Providence County Superior Court’s entry of final judgment on August 16, 2018, pursuant to a bench decision granting the request for declaratory and injunctive relief on the part of the plaintiffs—namely, K&W Automotive, LLC and its owners, Wendy and Kenneth Wajda, and ECIG Shed, Inc. and its owner, Louis DelSesto (collectively plaintiffs). On appeal, the Town asserts that the hearing justice erred in ruling that it lacked authority under its Home Rule Charter to enact an ordinance banning the sale of flavored tobacco products and prohibiting the providing of any tobacco products to persons under the age of twenty-one. Additionally, the Town argues that the hearing justice erred in failing to address whether the ordinance at issue is preempted by state law. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties and after a thorough review of the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts relative to this matter are not in dispute and are set forth herein as provided in the parties’ agreed-to stipulation of facts. On June 5, 2017, the Barrington Town Council (town council) enacted Ordinance No. 2017-7 making it “unlawful to sell or to possess with the intention of selling tobacco products within the town without a tobacco dealer’s license,” with such license being required “in addition to any other license required by state and/or federal law” (Licensing Ordinance). The Licensing Ordinance also imposed various conditions upon license holders, including a prohibition on “sell[ing] any tobacco product to any individual under the age of twenty- one (21) years” as well as a prohibition on “sell[ing] any flavored tobacco product to a consumer.”', 'On November 6, 2017, in reaction to litigation, the town council repealed the Licensing Ordinance and enacted a new ordinance, Ordinance No. 2017-17 (Tobacco Ordinance). The Tobacco Ordinance omitted the licensing requirement, but it retained two primary components of the Licensing Ordinance: (1) a prohibition on the sale of flavored tobacco products by any person other than an “electronic smoking device establishment” as defined in the ordinance1; and (2) a prohibition against providing tobacco products in any way to any person under the age of twenty- one. The Tobacco Ordinance also stated that “[a] person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of $100 for each separate offense.” It further stated that a person who 1', 'Section 170-1 of the Tobacco Ordinance defines “electronic smoking device establishment” as follows:', '“Any business which does not sell food or beverages and for which', 'the principal or core business is selling electronic smoking devices,', 'as evidenced by any of the following: 33% or more of floor or', 'display area is devoted to electronic smoking devices; or 67% or', 'more of gross sales receipts are derived from electronic smoking', 'devices.” Town of Barrington Code of Ordinances § 170-1 (2018).', '-2- violates the minimum age provision would be subject to a $350 fine for the second offense and a $500 fine “for the third or any subsequent offense occurring within one year of the first offense.”', 'On January 25, 2018, plaintiffs, two businesses located in the Town and licensed by the State of Rhode Island to sell tobacco and electronic nicotine delivery systems (electronic cigarettes) and their respective owners, filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief so as to prevent the Town from enforcing the Tobacco Ordinance. The plaintiffs’ complaint also referenced as interested parties seven other businesses located in the Town that are licensed to sell tobacco and/or electronic cigarettes.2', 'On July 19, 2018, after considering the oral and written submissions of the parties, the hearing justice issued a bench decision, in which she concluded that the Tobacco Ordinance was null and void; accordingly, she granted plaintiffs’ request for declaratory and injunctive relief.3 The hearing justice first determined that the Tobacco Ordinance primarily concerned public health and safety and that, therefore, “the [state’s] police power [was not] implicated.” Having cleared that hurdle, the hearing justice moved on to apply the three-variable test set forth in Town of East Greenwich v. O’Neil, 617 A.2d 104 (R.I. 1992). The hearing justice found that, pursuant to the O’Neil test, the Town did indeed lack authority under its Home Rule Charter to enact the Tobacco Ordinance because the subject matter involves a matter of statewide concern. Based on this ruling, 2', 'The complaint named the following entities as interested parties: Regency Cigar Emporium, LLC; Maxi Drug South, L.P.; Rhode Island Country Club, Inc.; Sowams, A.M., Inc.; Colbea Enterprises, LLC; Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc.; and Grapes and Grains, Inc. 3', 'We note that the following entities, acting as amici curiae, filed a brief in Superior Court: the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network; the American Heart Association; the American Lung Association; the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; the Tobacco Control Legal Consortium; the Rhode Island Thoracic Society; the Truth Initiative; and the City of Providence, Rhode Island. The amici curiae argued in support of upholding the Tobacco Ordinance, asserting that it would serve to protect the Town’s residents, particularly its younger residents, from the health risks associated with tobacco use.', '-3- the hearing justice concluded that she did not need to determine if the Tobacco Ordinance is preempted by state law. Lastly, the hearing justice went on to address the issue of whether or not the Rhode Island General Assembly had delegated authority to the Town to legislate on this issue, and she found that the General Assembly had not provided the Town with such authority, either expressly or by necessary implication. An order and a final judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs on August 16, 2018, and the Town timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[A] decision to grant or deny declaratory or injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the [hearing] justice and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record demonstrates a clear abuse of discretion or the [hearing] justice committed an error of law.” La Gondola, Inc. v. City of Providence, 210 A.3d 1205, 1213 (R.I. 2019) (quoting Kayak Centre at Wickford Cove, LLC v. Town of Narragansett, 116 A.3d 250, 253 (R.I. 2015)). When deciding a case based on stipulated facts, “[t]he trial court does not play a fact-finding role, but is limited to applying the law to the agreed-upon facts.” Morse v.

Our review with respect to questions of law and statutory interpretation is de novo. Delbonis Sand & Gravel Co. v. Town of Richmond, 909 A.2d 922, 925 (R.I. 2006).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, the Town asserts that the hearing justice erred in finding that the Town did not have authority under its Home Rule Charter to enact the Tobacco Ordinance because, in the Town’s view, that ordinance addresses a matter of purely local concern. The Town further argues', '-4- that, because the Tobacco Ordinance addresses a matter of local concern, the hearing justice erred in failing to analyze whether the ordinance is preempted by state law. Such analysis, the Town argues, would have shown that the ordinance is consistent with state law and, thus, is not preempted. The Town also contends that, in conducting her analysis, the hearing justice did not give appropriate weight to State ex rel. Town of Westerly v. Bradley, 877 A.2d 601 (R.I. 2005).', 'The plaintiffs assert that the Tobacco Ordinance addresses a matter of statewide concern because it involves the regulation of business, over which they contend the state has exclusive power to legislate. The plaintiffs also assert that the Tobacco Ordinance involves a matter of statewide concern when analyzed under the three-part test set forth in O’Neil. Accordingly, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice correctly found that no preemption analysis was necessary because the Town did not have authority to enact the ordinance in the first instance, either through its authority with respect to local concerns or through any enabling legislation enacted by the General Assembly. The plaintiffs also contend that, even if preemption is applicable, the minimum age provision is preempted because state law occupies the field. Lastly, plaintiffs aver that the Town’s reliance on this Court’s holding in Bradley is misplaced.', 'A', 'Authority Under the Town’s Home Rule Charter', 'In analyzing the Town’s contentions on appeal, we first address whether the Town, under its constitutionally authorized Home Rule Charter, had the authority to enact the Tobacco Ordinance. In 1951, the General Assembly enacted the Home Rule Amendment to the Rhode Island Constitution, granting to municipalities “the right to self government in all local matters.” R.I. Const., art. 13, § 1. Specifically, article 13, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides:', '-5-', '“Every city and town shall have the power at any time to adopt a', 'charter, amend its charter, enact and amend local laws relating to its', 'property, affairs and government not inconsistent with this', 'Constitution and laws enacted by the general assembly in', 'conformity with the powers reserved to the general assembly.” R.I.', 'Const., art. 13, § 2; see Amico’s Inc. v. Mattos, 789 A.2d 899, 903', '(R.I. 2002). Pursuant to its authority under the Home Rule Amendment, the Town adopted the Barrington Town Charter (Home Rule Charter), which expressly vests the town council with the power “[t]o enact, amend or repeal ordinances for the preservation of the public peace, the health, safety, comfort and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town and for the protection of persons and property.” Barrington Town Charter, § 2-1-6(a).', 'This Court has repeatedly held that the Home Rule Amendment allows municipalities to legislate on matters of purely local concern. Amico’s Inc., 789 A.2d at 903; O’Neil, 617 A.2d at 111; Westerly Residents for Thoughtful Development, Inc. v. Brancato, 565 A.2d 1262, 1264 (R.I. 1989) (holding that a town’s decision to expand its sewer system was a matter of “purely local concern”). At the same time, however, we are mindful of the following pertinent principle: “Municipalities may not * * * legislate on matters of statewide concern. The power of the General Assembly remains exclusive in those areas.” O’Neil, 617 A.2d at 111 (quoting Brancato, 565 A.2d at 1264). We have consistently recognized that “the Legislature continues to exclusively occupy the fields of education, elections, and taxation, thereby precluding any municipality’s foray into these areas, absent specific legislative approval.” Amico’s Inc., 789 A.2d at 903; see Brancato, 565 A.2d at 1264 (recognizing that the General Assembly maintains exclusive power over “the regulation of police affairs, the conduct of business, licensing, education, and elections”) (quoting Bruckshaw v. Paolino, 557 A.2d 1221, 1223 (R.I. 1989)). In O’Neil, this Court, after recognizing the need for greater clarification with respect to matters that do not fall squarely within one of the', '-6- above-mentioned categories, identified three variables to be considered in discerning whether a matter is of local or statewide concern: (1) whether “uniform regulation throughout the state is necessary or desirable;” (2) “whether a particular matter is traditionally within the historical dominion of one entity;” and, most critically, (3) whether “the action of a municipality has a significant effect upon people outside the home rule town or city * * *.” O’Neil, 617 A.2d at 111.', 'It now becomes our duty to apply to the Tobacco Ordinance the three-variable test set forth in O’Neil. As to the first variable, it is our view that uniform regulation of tobacco throughout the state is desirable, if not necessary. In O’Neil, the Town of East Greenwich passed an ordinance creating a moratorium on the construction of power lines exceeding a specified voltage. Id. at 106. This Court noted that three nearby municipalities had enacted similar ordinances, and the Court proceeded to express concern that patchwork legislation would “handicap compliance with safety regulations and inhibit the efficient distribution of electrical power.” Id. at 111-12. Accordingly, the Court concluded that uniform regulation was necessary. Id. at 112. Similar to the situation which confronted the Court in O’Neil, at least four other Rhode Island municipalities have in recent years passed ordinances regulating the sale of flavored tobacco products. Moreover, the Rhode Island Department of Health, in response to an executive order issued by the Governor on September 25, 2019, promulgated an emergency regulation temporarily banning the sale of all flavored electronic cigarette products.4 216 RICR 50-15-6.9. Although patchwork legislation with 4', 'On October 23, 2019, several businesses filed an action in Superior Court challenging the validity of the emergency regulation. On November 5, 2019, the Superior Court issued a decision denying the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, finding that the Department of Health had provided a sufficient basis for enacting the emergency regulation but also finding that the Department had failed to comply with the publication requirement of G.L. 1956 § 45-35-2.10. Vapor Technology Association v. Raimondo, PC-2019-10370, 2019 WL 5865900, at *1, *10 (R.I. Super. Ct. Nov. 5, 2019). Accordingly, the hearing justice gave the Department until November 8, 2019 to properly issue a public statement. Id. at *10. On November 6, 2019, the Department filed a Notice of Compliance and supporting affidavit indicating that it had published the Reason', '-7- respect to tobacco products does not raise the same level of immediate safety concerns as did the issue of power lines that was before the Court in O’Neil, there is nonetheless a legitimate concern that inconsistent regulations respecting tobacco will lead to confusion and decrease compliance with various federal and state regulations. Additionally, in our judgment, a comprehensive approach is desirable because it will increase the effectiveness of tobacco regulations by preventing persons otherwise prohibited from obtaining a certain tobacco product in one municipality from simply traveling to the nearest municipality that does permit such a purchase.', 'Turning to the second variable in the O’Neil analytical process, it is clear to this Court that tobacco regulation has traditionally fallen within the purview of the state. It was in 1892 that the General Assembly first enacted a statute prohibiting the providing of “any tobacco in the form of cigarettes” to minors under the age of sixteen. 1892 Acts and Resolves, ch. 1053, § 1. Moreover, since 1939, the state has required persons seeking to sell tobacco products in Rhode Island to obtain a license from the state tax administrator and to comply with various conditions or be exposed to the imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties. P.L. 1939, ch. 663, § 2; G.L. 1956 §§ 44-20-1 through 44-20-55. In addition to the licensing scheme, in 1996, the General Assembly enacted legislation with the express intent being “to preserve and protect the health of children by (1) stopping the illegal sale of tobacco to children, and (2) by severely punishing those who disregard the laws relating to the illegal sale of tobacco products to children.” P.L. 1996, ch. 321, § 1 (entitled “An Act to Stop the Illegal Sale of Tobacco Products to Children”); G.L. 1956 § 11- 9-13.3. Among other things, the act prohibited the sale of tobacco products to persons under the for Finding Imminent Peril as well as the emergency regulation on the homepage of the Department’s website. On November 25, 2019, the defendants, Governor Gina Raimondo, the Department of Health, and the Director of the Department of Health, Nicole Alexander-Scott, M.D., filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint, which is currently pending before the Superior Court.', '-8- age of eighteen, imposed various conditions upon the sale of tobacco products, and required the Department of Health to investigate possible violations of the act and to impose penalties accordingly. See §§ 11-9-13 and 11-9-14. More recently, the General Assembly has established a licensing scheme for the sale of electronic cigarettes, which is administered by the Department of Health. General Laws 1956 §§ 23-1-55 through 23-1-58.5 While we are aware that some municipalities have in fact enacted ordinances relating to the regulation of tobacco, it nonetheless remains true that the state has historically been the entity largely responsible for the regulation of this matter.', 'With respect to the third O’Neil variable, the Town argues that the effect of this particular ordinance on persons outside the Town is relatively minor. As there are currently only nine businesses in the Town licensed to sell tobacco and electronic cigarettes, the effect of the Tobacco Ordinance is not significant and would appear to actually benefit those businesses outside the Town by increasing their business. Another apparent effect is that persons from outside the Town who may find themselves in the Town and wish to purchase tobacco products that are prohibited by Barrington’s Tobacco Ordinance would have to travel to another municipality to do so. We are in agreement with the Town that these effects do not qualify as significant. However, the potential impact of municipalities across the state enacting their own various regulations would have some significance. When addressing the third variable, the Court in O’Neil relied upon a case from the Supreme Court of New Jersey in reasoning that, if each municipality were to impose its own notion 5', 'In addition to regulating tobacco as a commodity, the General Assembly has further regulated tobacco by prohibiting smoking in public places, G.L. 1956 § 23-20.10-3, and in places of employment, § 23-20.10-4, as well as directing the local governing bodies of each school to develop procedures to enforce a prohibition on the use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes by any person utilizing school facilities and to provide smoking cessation programs for school employees, G.L. 1956 §§ 23-20.9-5 and 23-20.9-7.', '-9- as to how to transmit electric current, “nothing but chaos would result, and neither the utility nor the state agency vested with control could be assured of [the] ability to fulfill its obligations of furnishing safe, adequate and proper service to the public in all areas.” O’Neil, 617 A.2d at 112 (quoting In re Public Service Electric and Gas Co., 173 A.2d 233, 241 (N.J. 1961)). As was mentioned with respect to the first variable, if each municipality were to impose its own tobacco regulations, the state’s ability to efficiently enforce its own statutes and regulations relating to both tobacco and the conduct of business would be adversely affected.', 'Because the effect of inconsistent regulations on the state’s ability to foster public safety is significant, we conclude that third variable also supports the conclusion that the Tobacco Ordinance regulates a matter of statewide concern.6', 'Although the Tobacco Ordinance was enacted to protect public health and safety, our review of the three O’Neil variables leads us to conclude that the Tobacco Ordinance constitutes legislation concerning a matter of statewide concern and that it, therefore, infringes upon the power of the state. Accordingly, we are in agreement with the hearing justice’s conclusion that the Town lacked authority under its Home Rule Charter to enact the Tobacco Ordinance.7 6', 'The Town also contends on appeal that the hearing justice did not give proper weight to this Court’s decision in State ex rel. Town of Westerly v. Bradley, 877 A.2d 601 (R.I. 2005), when deciding whether the Tobacco Ordinance involves a matter of statewide rather than purely local concern. We deem this argument to be without merit, and we shall address it no further. 7', 'In its briefing and oral arguments before the Superior Court, the Town also argued that the General Assembly delegated authority to the Town to pass the Tobacco Ordinance through various statutes, including: G.L. 1956 § 45-6-1, chapter 20.10 of title 23, G.L. 1956 chapter 9 of title 11, and G.L. 1956 chapter 20.1 of title 44. The Town briefly makes reference to this argument in one sentence of its statement filed pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. However, this argument has not been adequately developed; and, therefore, we deem it waived on appeal. See Broccoli v. Manning, 208 A.3d 1146, 1149 (R.I. 2019) (“This Court generally deems an issue waived when a party simply states an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 10 -', 'B', 'Preemption', 'We now turn to the Town’s argument that the hearing justice erred in failing to conduct a preemption analysis.', 'Relying upon this Court’s decision in Town of Warren v. Thornton- Whitehouse, 740 A.2d 1255 (R.I. 1999), the hearing justice in this case found that she did not need to engage in a preemption analysis because she had already concluded that the Tobacco Ordinance involved a matter of statewide concern. In Town of Warren, we stated that “preemption only exists in circumstances in which the municipality would have the authority to regulate a particular subject in the absence of state action.” Town of Warren, 740 A.2d at 1261. As we have similarly concluded in this case that the Town lacked the authority under its Home Rule Charter to enact the Tobacco Ordinance, it is our view that the hearing justice did not err in refraining from deciding whether the ordinance was preempted by state law.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff, Raymond Ted Boschetto (Ted), appeals from an amended decision pending entry of final judgment terminating his marriage to the defendant, Cindy Boschetto (Cindy), on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.1 On appeal, Ted challenges the trial justice’s assignment of certain marital assets as well as her determination of the amount of his child support obligation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Ted and Cindy married in September 2007. The month before the wedding, they executed a premarital agreement in which they agreed, inter alia, that, in the event of termination of the 1', 'We refer to the parties by their first names for clarity. In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '-1- marriage, they would evenly divide all jointly-owned assets except for certain assets specifically identified in the agreement; they also agreed to waive alimony. Ted and Cindy have one daughter, born in November 2009.', 'In June 2015, Ted filed a complaint for divorce in the Newport County Family Court, citing irreconcilable differences that had caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage as grounds therefor, and requesting joint custody of their daughter with physical placement assigned to him, alimony and child support awarded to him, and an equitable distribution of the marital assets. Cindy filed a counterclaim requesting sole custody of their daughter with reasonable visitation rights for Ted and permission to relocate to Massachusetts with their daughter. Cindy also sought child support, reimbursement for money borrowed by Ted during the marriage, and an equitable distribution of the marital assets.', 'A trial in the Family Court began in June 2016, with Cindy represented by counsel and Ted representing himself, pro se. The trial justice heard testimony from several witnesses, including Cindy, Ted, the two guardians ad litem assigned to represent their daughter’s interest, and others.2 Most of the testimony by Cindy and Ted recounted the rise and fall of their marriage, specifically testifying about their own—and each other’s—employment schedules and work habits as well as the division of labor in raising their daughter, especially the ways in which they had handled, or mishandled, sharing the time with their daughter as they proceeded through the latter years of their marriage, their separation, and the pendency of their divorce proceedings. Most of the details of 2', 'Ted ordered excerpts from the trial testimony but not full transcripts of the entire trial. As a result, we have reviewed only these excerpted portions of the trial testimony, in which Cindy and Ted were the only two witnesses to testify.

Initially, she worked out of Boston, then from her home, also traveling frequently for work. For his part, Ted was self-employed, managing his own business.', 'Shortly before the parties filed for divorce, Ted signed a contract to purchase property in Middletown, which he intended as either an investment or a residence, using money from a joint account he held with Cindy for the initial deposit. Cindy testified that she had never been interested in acquiring this property with Ted, in part because she knew the marriage was over and in part because she did not want to continue living in Rhode Island. The real estate deal fell through, and the parties lost the $10,000 deposit. With respect to other spending, Cindy testified that she had withdrawn approximately $33,600 from her Morgan Stanley retirement investment accounts during the divorce proceedings to cover rental payments for multiple properties as well as to pay legal fees for both herself and Ted.', 'On September 26, 2016, the trial justice filed a written decision. She awarded the parties joint custody of their daughter, with primary placement awarded to Cindy. Their daughter would spend every other weekend and one weekday evening per week with Ted, with the opportunity for additional time during the summer and a set schedule for annual holidays. The trial justice ordered Ted to pay $250 per week to Cindy for child support, and the trial justice determined specific allocations of the parties’ assets for equitable distribution.', 'Relevant to the issues on appeal, the trial justice found that Cindy commuted “five (5) plus hours” to Boston each day, while Ted “was doing martial arts and enjoying the Newport lifestyle,', '-3- which included what had long been a weekly routine—Thursday and Saturday nights out drinking.” She further found that Ted “ha[d] no qualms about verbally abusing” Cindy in the presence of their child. The trial justice ordered that: (1) Ted and Cindy were to keep the rights and title to their individual bank accounts at BankNewport and Citizens Bank, respectively; (2) the parties’ joint account at California Republic Bank was to be equitably divided after taking into account Ted’s unilateral decision to withdraw $10,000 for the deposit on the Middletown property, to which Cindy had not agreed; (3) the contributions made to Cindy’s 401K account by Cindy and her employer since the date of the marriage were to be equitably divided between the parties; (4) the appreciation of the value of Cindy’s account with Morgan Stanley was to be subject to equitable distribution, and Cindy’s unilateral decision to withdraw $33,600 from the account to cover costs of “prosecution of th[e] divorce * * * [would] not be added back into the value of the Morgan Stanley accounts”; and (5) Ted would pay Cindy $250 per week as child support.', 'An Amended Decision Pending Entry of Final Judgment entered in November 2016.

See Wright v. Zielinski, 824 A.2d 494, 497, 497-98 n.2 (R.I. 2003) (the Family Court has jurisdiction to hear breach-of-premarital-contract claims).

The relevant provision stated that “all future contributions to Cindy’s investment accounts in excess of the amounts shown [in the agreement', '-5- as the value of the accounts at that time] shall be treated as if jointly owned by the parties” and divided equally between the parties in the event of termination of the marriage. The agreement listed two investment accounts for Cindy: a 401K account through her employer and an account with Morgan Stanley.', '1', '401K Account', 'The value of Cindy’s 401K account at the time the parties executed the premarital agreement was $256,000. At the time of trial, the undisputed value of the 401K account was $629,400. The trial justice concluded that, pursuant to the premarital agreement, the sum of $158,950.05, which represented the total contributions to Cindy’s 401K account made by Cindy and her employer during the marriage, was subject to equitable distribution.', 'On appeal, Ted argues that the trial justice erred by failing to include interest and appreciation and by not assigning half of the total increase in value of the 401K account during the marriage for distribution.', 'According to Ted, the relevant paragraph in the premarital agreement—stating “all future contributions to [the] investment accounts”—means that the accrued interest and the total value of the account from the date of marriage until the date of divorce, in addition to the contributions made by Cindy and her employer during the marriage, should have been divided evenly between him and Cindy. If the trial justice had considered the total increase in value of the account during the marriage, then $373,400 would have been the amount to be divided evenly between the parties.', 'It is well established that the terms of a premarital agreement are to be enforced unless a party can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the agreement is not enforceable. General Laws 1956 § 15-17-6; see Rubino v. Rubino, 765 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 2001). We note, however,', '-6- that Ted has not challenged the enforceability of the premarital agreement, and on appeal he is disputing only the trial justice’s application of the relevant provisions of it. Therefore, we look to the language of the agreement. This Court will consider the “usual and ordinary meaning” of the terms in a “clear and unambiguous” contract. Management Capital, L.L.C. v. F.A.F., Inc., 209 A.3d 1162, 1173 (R.I. 2019) (quoting Andrukiewicz v. Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d 235, 238 (R.I. 2004)). In our opinion, the phrase “all future contributions” is unambiguous; its plain meaning refers to the active deposits made to the 401K account by Cindy and by her employer. The appreciation in the value of an investment account based on interest or growth in value of the investment funds to which an individual allocates contributions is distinct from the actual deposits, or contributions, made by the account holder. Here, the section of the premarital agreement providing Ted with half of the contributions to the investment accounts clearly states “contributions” and is silent about the appreciation of the value of the account or interest added to it. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the trial justice did not err in determining that the amount of Cindy’s 401K account subject to equitable distribution was $158,950.05.', 'In the alternative, Ted argues that the appreciation of the 401K account during the marriage was a marital asset, the entirety of which should have been subject to equitable distribution pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1. Ted contends that, if this Court determines that the premarital agreement was silent about the appreciation of the 401K account, then the trial justice had the discretion to consider the entire amount of appreciation as an asset to be equitably divided but erred by failing to consider any of the factors enumerated in § 15-5-16.1.', 'The appreciation of the value of an investment account may be subject to equitable distribution pursuant to § 15-5-16.1(b). See Marsocci v. Marsocci, 911 A.2d 690, 699 (R.I. 2006). Section 15-5-16.1(b) states, in pertinent part, that “the court may assign the appreciation of value', '-7- from the date of the marriage of property or an interest in property which was held in the name of one party prior to the marriage which increased in value as a result of the efforts of either spouse during the marriage.” As noted previously, however, the trial justice clearly considered Cindy’s 401K account to be governed by the plain language of the parties’ premarital agreement. Moreover, the record before us does not contain any evidence to demonstrate how the total appreciation in value of Cindy’s 401K account could be attributed to the $256,000 in the account at the time of the marriage as compared to the contributions made after the date of the marriage. Nor does the record provide any insight into the “efforts” made by either spouse to increase the value of the 401K account. The appreciation or depreciation of an investment account is generally attributable to market forces and not to the individual efforts of either spouse. We discern no cause therefore to disturb the trial justice’s allocation of the 401K account.3', '2', 'Morgan Stanley Account', 'Cindy’s Morgan Stanley investment account was also included in the premarital agreement; contributions made to this account during the marriage, in the event of termination of the marriage, were to be divided equally between Cindy and Ted. At the time of the execution of the premarital agreement, Cindy’s Morgan Stanley account value was $200,000. The trial justice 3', 'We acknowledge that we have previously affirmed a trial justice’s division of the appreciation in value of an asset that had been designated as solely owned by one spouse in the parties’ premarital agreement when the premarital agreement was silent about how or whether to divide the appreciation in value of this asset. Ryan-Gamron v. Gamron, 47 A.3d 333, 334, 335 (R.I. 2012) (mem.). In that case, the parties agreed that their premarital agreement was silent as to the appreciation in value of the asset—real estate owned solely by the husband at the time of the marriage. Id. at 334. The wife had used the property in the day-to-day operations of her daycare business during the marriage, and she challenged the trial justice’s determination of the appreciated value of the property that had been used to divide the asset between the parties. Id. at 333, 334, 335. The facts of the case are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar.', '-8- allocated the entire increase in value of the account as the sum to be divided between Cindy and Ted because Cindy had been unable to provide documentation to show the total contributions to the account during the marriage. Ted does not dispute the trial justice’s decision to allocate the entire increase in value of the account, but he does challenge the trial justice’s decision not to offset Cindy’s half by the $33,600 that she withdrew from the account during the divorce proceedings to cover some housing costs and attorneys’ fees for herself and for Ted. The trial justice concluded that “[a]ny monies withdrawn from the [account] in violation of the automatic [o]rders are determined as monies needed by Cindy in the prosecution of this divorce and need not be added back into the value of the Morgan Stanley accounts.” Ted contends that this resulted in the assignment of a portion of Cindy’s attorneys’ fees to Ted without first making a determination whether she was entitled to a contribution from him for the attorneys’ fees. Ted emphasizes that the trial justice ordered him to repay the $6,000 he had withdrawn from one of Cindy’s accounts to pay for his attorneys’ fees.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the excerpted trial testimony and the trial justice’s decision in this matter, it is our opinion that she did not abuse her discretion by choosing not to offset Cindy’s withdrawals from the Morgan Stanley account. As previously stated, we accord great deference to the trial justice’s findings of fact. She found that this withdrawal was “needed by Cindy in the prosecution of this divorce[,]” and we have no reason to second-guess this finding, especially in light of Cindy’s testimony that she spent this money on rent to sustain housing for Ted in Newport and for herself in Hingham, Massachusetts, and in Middletown, as well as to pay attorneys’ fees for herself and Ted. See Bober v. Bober, 92 A.3d 152, 161 (R.I. 2014). A trial justice is imbued with “wide discretion to divide the marital property justly and fairly between the parties.” Wu- Carter v.

We are well satisfied that the trial justice was acting within her discretion in distributing Cindy’s Morgan Stanley account.', 'B', 'Middletown Property Expenses', 'The trial justice determined that Ted’s liabilities to Cindy included a $10,000 withdrawal from the parties’ joint California Republic Bank account to use as a deposit for an ultimately unsuccessful property acquisition in Middletown. Ted argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she included this amount as part of Ted’s liabilities to Cindy and that the trial justice should have ordered Ted to return the $10,000 to the joint account to be divided equally between them.', 'The trial justice also concluded that Ted incurred an additional $7,500 for expenses in connection with the purchase and sale agreement for this property. Ted argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she did not consider the $7,500 Ted claimed for what he spent on attorneys’ fees and on an architect employed during the unsuccessful property acquisition as part of the liabilities to be equitably divided between the parties. Ted asserts that he invested in the property for the benefit of the entire family.', 'In considering the distribution of the California Republic Bank account, the trial justice determined that Ted withdrew $10,000 in conjunction with his execution of the purchase and sale agreement for the Middletown property. She further found that, at that time, “Ted was looking to ‘invest’ in property on Aquidneck Island” and was aware that Cindy was no longer interested in living in Newport because “the marriage had failed.” Moreover, Cindy never signed or approved the purchase and sale agreement. The trial justice further found that the $7,500 for expenses incurred by Ted in connection with the agreement were “his and his alone.”', '- 10 -', 'Given the trial justice’s wide discretion to decide how to allocate or offset spending from marital assets by one spouse during the marriage, we find no error in the trial justice’s decision in this case to consider Ted’s spending on the property as a unilateral decision which should be offset in the calculation of Ted’s liabilities owed to Cindy. See Bober, 92 A.3d at 161.', 'C', 'Individual Bank Accounts', 'The trial justice found that Cindy and Ted each had a bank account in their individual names and awarded Cindy the entire balance of her bank account with Citizens Bank (approximately $10,000) and Ted the entire balance of his bank account with BankNewport (approximately $2,000). Ted argues that the trial justice erred when she awarded Cindy the entire balance of the Citizens Bank account and did not include the value of this account in the assets to be equitably divided between the parties. The trial justice offered no explanation with respect to the distribution of these two accounts. Neither account is specified in the premarital agreement, nor are they “assets owned jointly by the parties” that must be divided equally under the terms of the agreement. In light of the trial justice’s overall findings and the fact that these two accounts were held in individual names, we are hard-pressed to conclude that the trial justice abused her discretion. “Marital assets are to be divided equitably, though not necessarily equally.” Bober, 92 A.3d at 162 (brackets omitted) (quoting Ruffel v.

Ted refers to the portions of the trial testimony in which he was not allowed to explore a rekindled relationship Cindy may have had during the marriage with an old beau or a conversation Cindy may have had with an attorney about the distribution of their assets pursuant to the premarital agreement prior to the start of the divorce proceedings. Cindy counterargues that the reason Ted gave during trial for proceeding with his inquiry into these topics was to challenge Cindy’s credibility, therefore he has waived his argument on appeal about the relevance of these lines of inquiry for the statutory distribution of assets.

6,State ex rel. Coventry Police Department : v. : Zachary Charlwood. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Is a motorist, who had been charged with a first violation of operating a motor vehicle after his license has been suspended, entitled to have his records sealed under the provisions of Rhode Island General Laws § 12-1-12? We granted the petition of Zachary Charlwood (Charlwood or defendant) for a writ of certiorari seeking review of an order of the District Court denying his motion to seal his record. This case came before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause as to why the issues raised by this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we quash the order of the District Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In October 2017, a Coventry police officer stopped Charlwood for driving a motor vehicle after his license had been suspended. Thereafter, Charlwood was charged in District Court with a violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18, specifically that he “did * * * operate a motor vehicle * * *', '-1- after his license to operate had been suspended[,]” first violation. The charge was later dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure because defendant’s license had been reinstated. Charlwood then moved to seal his court records under G.L. 1956 § 12-1-12. The trial judge granted this motion in an order dated October 24, 2017 (October Order). On November 1, 2017, however, the trial judge sua sponte denied the same motion by handwriting “DENIED” on the original order (November Order).', 'Charlwood filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking this Court to review the denial of his motion. On September 25, 2018, we granted defendant’s petition, summarily vacated the order denying defendant’s motion to seal, and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to “conduct a hearing forthwith on the petitioner’s motion to seal with all parties present.” We also ordered that the papers be returned to this Court, subsequent to the “entry of an order granting or denying petitioner’s motion to seal.”', 'On remand before the trial judge, Charlwood made both procedural and substantive arguments. He argued that, because this Court had vacated the November Order denying his motion, the October Order granting his motion was still in effect. Thus, he asserted, the trial judge did not have the authority to vacate the October Order because there was no motion pending before her to do so. With respect to the merits of his motion, Charlwood contended that, under the provisions of § 12-1-12(b), the sealing statute applies to persons “detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense,” precisely the situation in which, Charlwood maintained, he found himself. The state did not object to defendant’s motion.1 1', 'The state made an additional argument as to why defendant’s motion to seal should be granted and referred the trial judge to G.L. 1956 § 12-1.3-2(g): “[A] person may file a motion for the expungement of records related to an offense that has been decriminalized subsequent to the date of their conviction[.]”', '-2-', 'The trial judge denied Charlwood’s motion to seal and determined that “the language of the sealing and expungement statute makes it clear that that statute is for criminal offenses only, not civil.”2 Because defendant was charged with a first violation of driving with a suspended license, a civil violation, the trial judge found that no relief was provided to defendant by the plain and ordinary meaning of § 12-1-12. The trial judge looked to the language of the statute and noted that the statute speaks only to criminal cases and is silent with respect to civil violations; therefore, she concluded that the Legislature had not provided a mechanism to seal or expunge civil violations. Thus, the trial judge denied the motion. The papers were then returned to this Court in accordance with our order of September 25, 2018.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that this Court’s “review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” Sandy Point Farms, Inc. v.

Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392 (1979)).', 'We begin our analysis of § 12-1-12(b)’s application to the facts of this case by noting that the charging document was entitled “State of Rhode Island District Court Criminal Complaint” and assigned a criminal docket number. Moreover, the ultimate disposition of the case was a dismissal under Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. It would appear, therefore, that Charlwood was charged with a criminal offense, and thus clearly the provisions of § 12-1-12(b) would not apply to him. A closer analysis, however, reveals several anomalies in the statutory framework at play in the case.', '-5-', 'The “criminal complaint” charges Charlwood with a violation of § 31-11-18, specifically stating that he did “operate a motor vehicle * * * after his license to operate had been suspended.” Further, it indicates that this was Charlwood’s first violation. The complaint also contains a series of four boxes indicating the nature of the illegal act with which Charlwood has been charged; the boxes are designated: felony, misdemeanor, violation, and ordinance. The only box checked on Charlwood’s complaint was “violation[.]” Indeed, § 31-11-18(b) provides that “[u]pon a first violation under this section, a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), shall be imposed.” In light of these circumstances, we conclude that Charlwood was not “charged with an offense” within the meaning of § 12-1-12(b). Although procedurally the charge against Charlwood had the trappings of a criminal complaint, it is clear that he was liable only for a civil penalty.', 'Our analysis is further informed by the statutory language of § 31-11-18, as well as by its statutory history. Subsection (a) provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ny person who drives a motor vehicle on any highway of this state * * * at a time when his or her license to operate is suspended * * * may be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Significantly, the statute was amended in 2016 to enact the current language that any such person “may be guilty of a misdemeanor.” The previous version provided that any such person “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Subsection 31-11-18(b) clarifies, however, that first and second violations are subject to a civil penalty only. It is clear to us, therefore, that Charlwood was charged with a civil violation and not a criminal offense.', 'Section 12-1-12(b) extends the requirements of § 12-1-12(a) “to persons detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense, or to persons against whom charges have been filed by the court, and the period of such filing has expired.” Charlwood was in fact detained by police, but he neither was charged with a criminal offense nor were charges against him filed by', '-6- the court in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-10-12.3 Accordingly, under the facts of this case we are of the opinion that the defendant falls squarely within the purview of § 12-1-12(b) as a person “detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense,” and we hold that the defendant is entitled to the benefits of § 12-1-12(a) with respect to the destruction and sealing of his records.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, this Court quashes the order of the District Court and remands the case for entry of an order consistent with this opinion. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-10-12 contains provisions related to the filing of a criminal complaint “other than a complaint for the commission of a felony or a complaint against a person who has been convicted of a felony or a private complaint.” If such a complaint is filed, the court has discretion to place conditions on such filing, for example, “performance of services for the public good.” Section 12-10-12(a).', '-7- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'State ex rel.

7,Benjamin Zanni : v. : Town of Johnston. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Court on November 7, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, Benjamin Zanni (plaintiff), appeals from the entry of summary judgment in the Superior Court in favor of the defendant, the Town of Johnston (the town).1 After reviewing the parties’ memoranda and considering their oral arguments, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case concerns an ordinance enacted by the Johnston Town Council (the town council) in 1989, which established various benefits for certain town officials, and the quest by a former member of that town council to collect those benefits. The plaintiff served on the town council from 1981 until 1994. 1', 'The plaintiff named the “Employment Retirement System of Rhode Island” as an interested party in the case, but the town is the sole defendant in the case.', '-1-', 'On April 10, 1989, the town passed and adopted Ordinance 767, entitled “Retirement Credit Benefits.” In pertinent part, Ordinance 767 provided that “[e]very elected or appointed full time paid official who has accumulated at least ten (10) years consecutive combined service shall receive the following benefits upon retirement at age 60[.]” The ordinance also provided that an official covered by the ordinance would receive whatever medical and dental insurance plans that were provided to regular town employees, and that the ordinance “shall take effect upon passage.” It was short-lived.', 'In 1993, Ordinance 767 was repealed by Ordinance 913, which was also entitled “Retirement Credit Benefits.” Ordinance 913 provided:', '“Ordinance numbered 767 is repealed in its entirety. Only those', 'elected or full time appointed officials who have already vested', 'their benefits under Ordinance 767 will be allowed to receive', 'them.', '“This ordinance shall take [e]ffect upon passage.” In 1994, plaintiff entered a plea of guilty in federal court to one felony count of “Extortion Under Color of Official Right” for acts of bribery while in office, from 1991 to 1994. He was sentenced to thirty-three months in prison and fined $20,000.', 'Beginning in the early 2000s, plaintiff made several demands on the town for the health benefits set forth in Ordinance 767, based on his belief that, as of 1991, his entitlement to those benefits had vested. The town consistently denied those requests on the grounds that, as a town council member, he was not a full-time official or employee and, additionally, because of his misconduct in office.', 'On September 30, 2015, plaintiff filed suit, alleging claims of governmental promissory estoppel and deprivation of property rights, and seeking compensatory damages, costs of suit, and attorneys’ fees. The plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment. On November 10, 2015,', '-2- the town filed a petition for removal to federal court; plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island on November 16, 2015. The action was remanded to the Superior Court from the District Court on November 24, 2015.', 'On May 29, 2018, the town moved for summary judgment in the Superior Court on the ground that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, Ordinance 767 operated prospectively rather than retroactively, and, therefore, plaintiff was not eligible for the benefits he claimed he was entitled to. The town also argued that a plain reading of Ordinance 767 revealed that an individual must be a full-time paid official―either appointed or elected―to be eligible under the ordinance, and plaintiff was not a full-time official.', 'The plaintiff opposed the town’s motion and also moved for declaratory judgment.2 He argued that Ordinance 767 was vague and ambiguous, and thus required the court to determine the legislative intent behind the enactment. He argued that the members of the town council and other elected officials were the intended beneficiaries of Ordinance 767, whether or not they were full-time employees of the town, and that any interpretation that does not include them as beneficiaries would constitute an absurd result. The plaintiff also argued that Ordinance 767 is remedial in nature, as opposed to creating a substantive legal right, and, therefore, must be applied retroactively and not prospectively.3 Finally, plaintiff argued that, under the state Public 2', 'The parties ultimately agreed that the issue of the declaratory judgment was no longer applicable in the case. Therefore, that issue is not before us. 3', 'We note that plaintiff submitted an affidavit to the lower court on September 4, 2018, opining on the legislative intent behind Ordinance 767. He asserted, under oath, that he presided over the promulgation of Ordinance 767, that Ordinance 767 was intended to benefit town council officials, and that it was the intent of the town council that Ordinance 767 would be applied retroactively. In our de novo review, we decline to accord any weight to this self-serving affidavit.', '-3- Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act, chapter 10.1 of title 36 of the general laws, the town lacked standing to revoke or reduce his benefits based on his dishonorable service. The plaintiff also moved for declaratory judgment and demanded judgment against the town with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties arising out of Ordinance 767.', 'On September 19, 2018, the trial justice granted the town’s motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the trial justice decided that Ordinance 767 created a substantive rather than remedial right, and that Ordinance 767 therefore applied prospectively and not retroactively. As such, because plaintiff did not accrue the ten years of consecutive service component necessary to be eligible for benefits under Ordinance 767, there was no genuine issue of material fact and plaintiff was not entitled to benefits under the ordinance. The plaintiff appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“‘This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.’” Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013) (brackets omitted) (quoting Sacco v.

Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, plaintiff advances several arguments in support of his contention that the town’s motion for summary judgment was improperly granted. The plaintiff argues that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the trial justice should have considered Ordinance 913 to determine the legislative intent of the town in enacting Ordinance 767 and should have then concluded that the ordinance was intended to be applied retroactively. The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice erred in finding that Ordinance 767 applied prospectively rather than retroactively, because, according to plaintiff, the ordinance is remedial in nature as opposed to creating a substantive legal right.', 'The town contends that the trial justice properly refused to consider Ordinance 913 because, the town argues, there is no relevant caselaw suggesting that a repealing ordinance is controlling or even relevant to a determination of the legislative intent behind the repealed ordinance. Rather, the town argues, when legislation does not specifically state whether it applies retroactively or prospectively, the test is simply whether the ordinance is remedial in nature or creates a substantive legal right. The town contends that legislation that is remedial in nature is to be applied retroactively; and, where legislation creates a substantive legal right, as', '-5- Ordinance 767 does, the legislative intent was to apply the ordinance on a prospective basis. The town argues that the trial justice correctly found that Ordinance 767 applied prospectively because it created a substantive legal right―namely, a vested right to medical benefits―rather than being a remedial measure.', 'The town alternatively argues that, however Ordinance 767 is to be applied, plaintiff was not covered by the ordinance because he was never a “full time paid official” with the town, as required under the ordinance. Finally, the town argues that it had the right to exercise discretion in denying plaintiff benefits based on his dishonorable service to the town in relation to his 1994 felony conviction for extortion under federal law.', 'The Clear and Unambiguous Language of Ordinance 767', 'We begin our analysis by examining the language of Ordinance 767. Although the trial justice decided the motion for summary judgment on different grounds, we are of the opinion that, based on the clear and unambiguous language of Ordinance 767, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff is entitled to benefits under the ordinance, and therefore summary judgment was properly granted. Ordinance 767 clearly and unambiguously states that only “full time paid official[s]” may receive benefits under the ordinance. (Emphasis added.) A “full-time” employee is “[o]ne who is hired to work at least the normal number of hours in a workweek as defined by an employer or a statute, usu[ally] 35 to 40 hours.” Black’s Law Dictionary 662 (11th ed. 2019).4 4', 'An example of the number of hours in the workweek of a full-time employee is forty hours. See G.L. 1956 § 28-12-4.1(a) (providing Rhode Island’s overtime-pay laws, which state, in part: “Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no employer shall employ any employee for a workweek longer than forty (40) hours unless the employee is compensated at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate at which he or she is employed for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week”).', '-6-', 'Clearly, plaintiff’s employment as a member of the town council cannot be categorized as “full-time” employment. The Charter of the Town of Johnston and its provisions related to the duties of the town council make no provision for a standard number of hours of working time. Rather, the Charter merely provides, in part, as follows, in Article III:', '“Sec. 3-7 Meetings.', '“The first meeting of each newly elected town council shall be', 'held following the swearing into office of its members pursuant to', 'section 2-4 of this Charter. Thereafter the town council shall meet', 'regularly at such time and at such place as may be prescribed by', 'its rules but not less frequently than once each month.” (Emphasis', 'added.) Therefore, rather than providing a normal number of hours in a workweek for members of the town council, the Charter merely provides a minimum number of meetings to be held each month.', 'Furthermore, the town submitted an affidavit of Vincent Baccari, who served as the Town Clerk for the town. Mr. Baccari averred that he was “aware of the duties, responsibilities, composition, and characterization of employment of the Johnston Town Council since 1981” and that, since 1981, members of the town council have been considered part-time elected officials and employees. He also declared that, since 1981, members of the town council have been compensated as part-time employees and worked, on average, less than thirty hours per week.5 Finally, he stated that: “Benjamin Zanni’s employment with the Town of Johnston as a Town Councilman from 1981–1994 was considered part-time employment.”', 'Ordinance 767 clearly and unambiguously states that only “full time paid official[s]” may 5', 'Section 3-5 of the Charter provides that: “The annual salary of members of the town council shall be five hundred dollars except that of the president of the town council who shall receive annually seven hundred and fifty dollars.”', '-7- receive benefits under the ordinance. The record in this case unequivocally establishes that plaintiff was not a “full time” official in his capacity as a member of the town council and that he, therefore, was not eligible to receive benefits under Ordinance 767.6 Pursuant to the town Charter, he received only $500 per year as compensation as a councilmember. Because the clear and unambiguous language of Ordinance 767 indicates that plaintiff was not eligible to receive benefits under the ordinance, we affirm the grant of summary judgment, but we do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice.', 'Prospective Application of Ordinance 767', 'Nonetheless, we deem it appropriate to address plaintiff’s argument that Ordinance 767 was intended to be applied retroactively from the time it was enacted, rather than prospectively. Although he relies on this Court’s decision in Prew v. Employee Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 556 (R.I. 2016), to advance his argument that Ordinance 767 is remedial in nature and, therefore, is to be applied retroactively, plaintiff’s reliance on Prew is misplaced.', '“When interpreting an ordinance, we employ the same rules of construction that we apply when interpreting statutes.” Ruggiero v. City of Providence, 893 A.2d 235, 237 (R.I. 2006). “In general, statutes and their amendments are presumed to operate prospectively unless it appears by clear, strong language or by necessary implication that the Legislature intended to give the statute retroactive effect.” VanMarter v. Royal Indemnity Co., 556 A.2d 41, 44 (R.I. 1989).', 'When a statute or ordinance “lacks the requisite specificity or necessary implication” regarding retroactive application, the distinction between a statute that is remedial in nature and one that creates a substantive legal right guides the analysis. Lawrence v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 523 A.2d 6', 'We also note that Ordinance 767 mandates that beneficiaries receive their benefits only “upon retirement at age 60[.]” The plaintiff did not retire from service and did not reach the age of sixty until 2010, roughly seventeen years after Ordinance 767 was repealed.', '-8- 864, 869 (R.I. 1987). A statute is remedial or procedural in nature if it “neither enlarges nor impairs substantive rights but prescribes the methods and procedures for enforcing such rights”; in that event, “it may be construed to apply retroactively.” Id. (quoting Norton v. Paolino, 113 R.I. 728, 733, 327 A.2d 275, 278 (1974)).', '“If, however, it creates, defines, or regulates substantive legal rights, it must be construed to operate prospectively.” Id.', 'In the case before us, Ordinance 767 simply declared that it shall take effect upon passage and does not include any express language or necessary implication that the town intended for it to apply retroactively. We therefore look to whether the enactment was remedial in nature, or if it created substantive legal rights. Clearly, Ordinance 767 sought to create a legal entitlement to retirement benefits for appointed or elected town officials that did not previously exist, and, therefore, the enactment cannot be deemed a remedial ordinance.', 'When Ordinance 767 took effect in 1989, plaintiff was serving as a member of the town council. On December 27, 1993, the ordinance was repealed, apparently before anyone in town employ became entitled to the benefits. Therefore, from the time Ordinance 767 was enacted until it was repealed by Ordinance 913, plaintiff had accrued, at most, four years of consecutive service as a member of the town council, six years short of the ten years required to vest. Thus, even setting aside the analysis of the plain language of Ordinance 767 mandating full-time service, plaintiff is not eligible for the benefits he seeks under Ordinance 767.', 'We are of the opinion that Ordinance 767 sought to create a right to health benefits that did not previously exist, and it did not provide any type of remedy as plaintiff suggests.

The plaintiffs, Mohammad Banki, M.D., D.M.D., and Frank Paletta, M.D., D.M.D., 2 filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of an order and judgment of the Superior Court granting the motion of the defendant, the Rhode Island Department of Health, 3 to dismiss their complaint. We granted the petition on December 18, 2015, and ordered that the case remain in the Superior Court for a hearing to determine a limited issue. While the case was in the Superior Court, the department filed a petition for writ of certiorari of its own, in which it sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court that entered default judgment against it. We granted that petition as well and consolidated the two cases.

A hearing officer agreed, and on May 9, 2014, she entered a conditional order of dismissal against the department and ordered it to fully comply with the physicians’ discovery requests by May 14, 2014. The department provided additional responses on that day, but the physicians alleged that the responses were inadequate. On May 21, 2014, the physicians moved to dismiss the charges that had been filed against them, based on the conditional order of dismissal. The next day, a hearing was held on the motion to dismiss.

The physicians alleged in their complaint that the Order was final and therefore appealable under § 42-35-15. The department filed an answer to the complaint and moved to dismiss the complaint.', 'In its memorandum of law accompanying its motion to dismiss, the department argued that the physicians had appealed from an order that was interlocutory in nature and not a final order. Therefore, the department urged that the complaint should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because the complaint did not meet the requirements of § 42-35-15(a). In response, the physicians argued that, because they had alleged all the required elements under § 42-35-15(a), and because the Order was final, the complaint was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.', 'After considering the positions of the parties, the first hearing justice 7 held that the Order was interlocutory and therefore not subject to appeal unless the physicians satisfied the exception set forth in § 42-35-15(a), which provides that “[a]ny preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency act or ruling is immediately reviewable in any case in which review of the final agency order would not provide an adequate remedy.” The first hearing justice further held that the physicians had failed to provide any argument or allege any facts to indicate why their complaint fell within this exception.

The record reflects that the department failed to comply with that deadline. As a result, the second hearing justice entered a conditional order of dismissal and ordered the department to produce the original administrative record by August 3, 2016. On that day, the department submitted a certified administrative record entitled “Amended Administrative Hearing Record.” The department also informed the second hearing justice that the original administrative record had been lost.', 'The second hearing justice rejected the “Amended Administrative Hearing Record” and ruled that what had been submitted was not the certified administrative record of the appeal. The second hearing justice therefore granted the physicians’ motion to enter default judgment, denied the department’s motion to vacate the order of default, and dismissed the underlying charges against the physicians that were then pending before the board.

However, in the order and judgment, the first hearing justice referred to the department’s argument that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction.', 'Because there is some confusion over whether the first hearing justice in fact held that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the physicians’ administrative appeal, we deem it necessary to elucidate the law governing jurisdiction and the Administrative Procedures Act.', '-7-', '“The Superior Court of Rhode Island is a trial court of general jurisdiction.” Chase v.

Similarly, the question in this case is whether judicial intervention was proper, and not whether the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction. See Narragansett Electric Company v. Saccoccio, 43 A.3d 40, 44 (R.I. 2012) (holding that the failure to comply with the statutory requirements of challenging tax assessments raised the issue of the appropriateness of judicial intervention and not whether the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction).', 'We are of the firm opinion that the Superior Court did have subject-matter jurisdiction over the physicians’ administrative appeal.', 'However, we still must address whether judicial intervention in this case was appropriate. Notwithstanding the Superior Court’s equitable jurisdiction, which the physicians did not invoke, the Administrative Procedures Act, at § 42-35-15, makes judicial intervention appropriate in two circumstances. See § 42-35-15(a). First, the Superior Court may review a “final order” of an agency in a contested case after the plaintiff has “exhausted all administrative remedies available to him or her within the agency[.]” Section 42-35-15(a).

We have held that a denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order. E.g., Fayle v. Traudt, 813 A.2d 58, 61 (R.I. 2003). Additionally, the United States Supreme Court, in its definition of a “final” order in the analogous federal Administrative Procedures Act, has held that:', '“As a general matter, two conditions must be satisfied for agency', 'action to be ‘final’: First, the action must mark the ‘consummation’', 'of the agency’s decision[-]making process—it must not be of a', 'merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action', 'must be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’', 'or from which ‘legal consequences will flow[.]’” Bennett v. Spear,', '520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal citations omitted). It is crystal clear to us that an agency’s denial of a motion to dismiss neither determines the rights or obligations of the parties nor results in the “consummation” of the agency’s decision-making process. Instead, a denial of a motion to dismiss establishes only that the case will proceed to a hearing on the merits, and nothing more. Therefore, for judicial intervention to have been appropriate in the present case, the physicians would have been required to meet the exception laid out in § 42-35-15(a) concerning the appealability of interlocutory orders.', 'We are in complete disagreement with the physicians’ position that an interlocutory order can be a “final” order under the Administrative Procedures Act. By just reviewing the definition of the two words “final” and “interlocutory,” it is clear they mean the polar opposite. Additionally, the definition of a final order in the federal context indicates that a final order “must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178 (emphasis added).', '- 10 -', 'As part of their argument, the physicians construe § 42-35-12 as providing a definition of a final order. This argument is wholly without merit. Section 42-35-12 10 lists the requirements that must be embodied in a final order, including, but not limited to, the requirement that it be in writing or stated in the record, contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, and include a notice that judicial review is available. However, we do not agree that § 45-35-12 provides a definition of a final order. The mere fact that the Order contains all the elements required by § 42-35-12 indicates that the hearing officer may have believed the Order to be final. However, we are not bound by those conclusions.', '3', 'Exception to the Finality Rule', 'As to whether the physicians meet the exception laid out in § 42-35-15(a), they argue that they alleged futility in that their complaint alleged that they would be forced to proceed through the administrative process with inadequate discovery to challenge the department’s jurisdiction.', 'We have never been called upon to delineate what facts fulfill the requirement to review an interlocutory order under § 42-35-15(a). The physicians agree with the first hearing justice that review of an interlocutory order is appropriate only where further agency review “would be futile or would destroy the effectiveness of the relief sought[.]” See Almeida v. Plasters’ and Cement Masons’ Local 40 Pension Fund, 722 A.2d 257, 259 (R.I. 1998). We observe that this rule governs the exception to the requirement that all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a court 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-35-12 provides in part: “Any final order adverse to a party in a contested case shall be in writing or stated in the record. Any final order shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings. * * * Included with the final order shall be a separate notice advising the parties of the availability of judicial review[.]”', '- 11 - reviews a final order. Id. Because the physicians do not challenge the standard that the first hearing justice used, we therefore assume without deciding that that standard governs this inquiry.', 'From our review of the record, the physicians have not demonstrated how being forced to proceed through an administrative proceeding without possessing all the discovery that they sought would make review of any final order of the department futile or would destroy the effectiveness of appellate review of any final order of the department.', 'Without doubt, the physicians would have been well within their rights to raise this issue before the department, or before the Superior Court if they lost the underlying administrative action and appealed the final order. Even though interlocutory orders, subject to narrow exceptions, are not immediately appealable, this rule does not foreclose the possibility of review of the correctness of the order after a final order or judgment has been entered. In the context of interlocutory orders in the Superior Court, as a general rule those orders can be reviewed as part of a party’s appeal of the final judgment. See Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 291 (R.I. 2007) (holding that an appeal from final judgment that disposes of all remaining claims and encompassed all prior orders was sufficient under appellate rules to review a prior order); State v. Piedmont Funding Corporation, 121 R.I. 27, 29, 394 A.2d 694, 695 (1978) (“[A] final judgment or order for purposes of appealability is one that terminates all the litigation arising out of the action between the parties on the merits.”). In other words, any defendant who is aggrieved by a final judgment in a plaintiff’s favor may argue on appeal that the trial justice should have granted its earlier motion to dismiss. Additionally, the hearing officer’s belief that the Order was final and her inclusion of a notice of a right to appeal along with the Order does not bind this Court, nor does it bind the Superior Court.', 'Second, it cannot be gainsaid that the physicians may well be successful in the administrative proceeding. Although their ability to attack the jurisdiction of the department over', '- 12 - the merits of the charges brought against the physicians arguably could have been affected by a lack of discovery, the physicians may have in the end prevailed either on the merits of the charges against them or on the alleged jurisdictional issue.', 'We are of the opinion that the intervention of the Superior Court would have been inappropriate in this case and we agree with the first hearing justice that what was before him was interlocutory and therefore premature.

We agree.', 'As we have said in the context of our remand orders, “this Court has been clear that ‘lower courts that receive our remand orders may not exceed the scope of the remand or open up the proceeding to legal issues beyond the remand.’” State v. Arciliares, 194 A.3d 1159, 1162 (R.I. 2018) (deletion omitted) (quoting Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 93 A.3d 1022, 1031-32 (R.I. 2014)). This principle applies equally to our orders to the Superior Court. In our opinion, the second hearing justice exceeded the scope of our order.', '- 13 -', 'We ordered that the Superior Court retain this case for the sole purpose of determining “whether respondent DOH complied with the Hearing Officer’s conditional dismissal order of May 9, 2014 and, if not, * * * whether the said order was self-executing.” Thereafter, the second hearing justice ordered the department to return the original record, that had been submitted to the first hearing justice. We certainly appreciate the dilemma in which the second hearing justice found himself when he was informed that the record that he was ordered to review had been lost. The second hearing justice decided to resolve that dilemma by entering a default judgment against the department.', 'It is our opinion, however, that that action exceeded our mandate. We therefore are constrained to quash the judgment of the Superior Court. Although the second hearing justice was unable to fulfill our mandate because of the lost records, the case was before him for a limited purpose with a very specific mandate. In our opinion, the second hearing justice should have transmitted the case to this Court either without resolving the issue or resolved the issue himself on the basis of the record before the Superior Court at that time.', 'In any event, we are of the opinion that, under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, a default judgment against an agency in this instance was inappropriate. This unique issue is one of first impression because we have been unable to find any caselaw, either in our own or federal jurisprudence, where an agency has been subject to a default judgment for having lost the original administrative record. To the contrary, caselaw abounds that remand to the agency is the appropriate remedy for curing deficiencies in the record. See Champlin’s Realty Associates v.

9,"Patrick T. Conley : v. : Crown Realty, LLC, et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Crown Realty, LLC, appeals from a decree foreclosing its right of redemption to real property in North Providence that was the subject of a tax sale in 2017. The appeal came before the Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and after thoroughly examining the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Superior Court foreclosing Crown Realty’s right of redemption.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this case leave little room for dispute. Crown Realty was the owner of real property located at 2 Tag Drive in North Providence (the property). The property was used as a garage at which Crown Realty stored automobiles in connection with its towing business. On May', '-1- 18, 2017, the property was sold to the plaintiff, Patrick Conley, at a tax sale that was conducted by the Town of North Providence. On June 6, 2018, Mr. Conley, citing a failure of any interested party to redeem the property, filed a petition to foreclose the right of redemption. 1 One month later, on July 6, 2018, Duane Souza, the owner of Crown Realty, received a citation sent by Mr. Conley via certified mail which explained that all concerned parties would have twenty days after receipt of the citation to respond to the petition filed by Mr. Conley. The citation also explained that should there be a failure to respond to the petition within twenty days of the receipt of the citation, the petition would “be taken as confessed[,]” and Crown Realty would “be forever barred from contesting said petition or any decree entered thereon.” The parties agree that Crown Realty did not file an answer or otherwise object within the twenty-day period.', 'On August 3, 2018, Mr. Conley filed a motion seeking a decree pro confesso. 2 Then, on August 9, Mr. Souza called Mr. Conley’s office to inquire into the cost of redeeming the property. In response, a paralegal at Mr. Conley’s office sent an e-mail to Mr. Souza with a redemption statement indicating that $11,676.72 would be required to redeem the property, and noting: “INTEREST GOOD UNTIL August 18, 2018.” The statement also warned that “Suit Will Continue, and Judgment May Enter Against You, Unless Full Payment is Received[.]” Interestingly, Mr. Souza paid $7,995 to the Town of North Providence on August 10, 2018, which had the effect of paying the unpaid taxes on the property from the year 2017, to which Mr. Conley’s petition to foreclose did not relate. 1', 'The plaintiff also named Brenco Realty, LLC and the Town of North Providence as parties to the petition; those parties are not before the Court in this appeal. 2', 'Pro confesso means “having confessed or admitted liability, as by failing to appear when required.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1459 (11th ed. 2019).', '-2-', 'Then, on August 16, perhaps realizing his predicament, Mr. Souza obtained a cashier’s check for $11,676.72, the amount indicated in the redemption statement form that he had received via e-mail from Mr. Conley’s office. However, Mr. Souza did not deliver the check to Mr. Conley’s office until August 20, he asserts, due to a death in the family. The check, however, was not accepted when it was proffered on August 20. Thereafter, on August 28, Crown Realty filed a response to Mr. Conley’s petition to foreclose, along with a memorandum objecting to Mr. Conley’s motion for a decree pro confesso.', 'A justice of the Superior Court heard argument in September 2018 regarding Mr. Conley’s motion and Crown Realty’s objection. After allowing the parties to submit supplemental briefs, the justice issued a bench decision in November 2018, in which she determined that Crown Realty’s right of redemption was barred. In that decision, she determined that this Court’s decision in Conley v. Fontaine, 138 A.3d 756 (R.I. 2016), was largely controlling and did not favor Crown Realty’s request to redeem after the twenty-day period had elapsed. She also determined that she was unable to rule on whether the e-mail containing the redemption statement sent by Mr. Conley’s paralegal had created contractual rights between the parties, because the petition before her was filed pursuant to the tax-sale statute. One week later, a final decree was entered foreclosing the right of Crown Realty to redeem the property. Crown Realty timely appealed.', 'On appeal before this Court, Crown Realty makes two arguments. 3 It argues that this Court’s holding in Fontaine should not apply to this case because of the redemption statement that Mr. Conley’s paralegal sent to Mr. Souza. This, says Crown Realty, amounts to “a misleading 3', 'We note that Crown Realty makes a third argument, that Mr. Conley should be estopped from his right to a decree pro confesso due to, in Crown Realty’s words, “Conley’s intentional or negligent misrepresentation.” Because we find this argument to be wholly without merit, we do not address it.', '-3- representation as to when the property owner must redeem the tax title.” Crown Realty also argues that, even if Mr. Conley was entitled to a decree pro confesso, an implied contract existed obligating Mr. Conley to convey the property back to Crown Realty.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'At the core of this appeal is this Court’s decision in Fontaine. In that case, we explained certain aspects of chapter 9 of title 44 of the general laws related to tax sales. Fontaine, 138 A.3d at 760. We said in that case that, under that chapter, after the appropriate amount of time has passed since a purchaser acquired property at a tax sale, the purchaser “may file a petition in Superior Court to foreclose upon any interested party’s right of redemption.” Id. (quoting Izzo v. Victor Realty, 132 A.3d 680, 685 (R.I. 2016); citing § 44-9-25(a)). We further explained that, if the purchaser chooses to foreclose on the right of redemption, he must “send notice to all interested parties[.]” Id. (quoting Izzo, 132 A.3d at 685; citing § 44-9-27). Moreover, “[o]nce notice of the petition has been provided, ‘any interested party may redeem the property by filing an answer to the petition along with an offer to redeem on or before the specified return day, which may be fixed no sooner than twenty days after the issuance of the notice.’” Id. (quoting Johnson v. QBAR Associates, 78 A.3d 48, 52 (R.I. 2013); citing § 44-9-29). And finally, we explained that “if an ‘interested party fails to do so, a decree shall be entered which shall forever bar all rights of redemption.’” Id. (quoting Izzo, 132 A.3d at 685; citing § 44-9-30).', 'After spelling out the statutory framework in Fontaine, we evaluated whether it was proper for a justice of the Superior Court to grant a motion by a bank whose interest was being foreclosed to file an answer outside the twenty-day return period. Fontaine, 138 A.3d at 760. We assumed without deciding that the motion could be considered by the trial justice and concluded that,', '-4- because the bank did not show good cause as to why it had failed to comply with the deadline, the justice of the Superior Court should not have granted the bank’s motion. Id. at 760-61. Moreover, we considered whether the trial justice erred in ultimately allowing the bank to redeem the property and concluded that, because the bank failed to file a timely answer, and because its motion to file a late answer should not have been granted, the bank was in default pursuant to § 44-9-29. Id. at 761. We held that, because § 44-9-30 “provides that, if an interested party fails to file an answer along with an offer to redeem on or before the specified return day, * * * a decree should have been entered barring the [b]ank’s right of redemption.” Id.', 'In this case, despite the fact that Crown Realty does not contest that it did not respond within twenty days of receiving the notification that Mr. Conley sent, and further that Crown Realty acknowledged that there was no good reason for its failure to comply with that twenty-day deadline, Crown Realty nonetheless urges us not to apply what it terms “the draconian consequences of Conley v. Fontaine” to its case.', 'A', 'The Application of Fontaine', 'Crown Realty argues that Fontaine should not apply in this case because Mr. Conley, in the words of Crown Realty, “made a misleading representation as to when the property owner must redeem the tax title.” Crown Realty also relies on that argument to support its claim that it should be excused from the consequences of its failure to comply with the twenty-day return period because of excusable neglect.', 'Whether our precedent is applicable to the facts before us is a question of law and, as such, we review it de novo. Votolato v. Merandi, 747 A.2d 455, 460 (R.I. 2000).', '-5-', 'First, we reiterate that it is undisputed that Crown Realty did not respond within the twenty-day period to the notice it received from Mr. Conley on July 6, 2018. Second, Crown Realty acknowledged that there was no good reason for its failure to respond within that time period. In fact, Crown Realty’s attorney stated below: “There’s no question that my client did not comply with that part of the law.” Rather, the “misleading representation” Crown Realty takes issue with was the redemption statement sent by a paralegal to Mr. Souza via e-mail on August 9, two weeks after the twenty-day period had expired. And third, Crown Realty’s allusion to excusable neglect refers to its failure to respond to the redemption statement attached to the paralegal’s e-mail by the August 18 date stated thereon, which has nothing to do with the original citation.', 'In light of these facts, we are satisfied that Crown Realty’s request that an exception to Fontaine be applied in this case is misplaced. In Fontaine, we merely explained the relevant statutory framework and “interpret[ed] the statute literally and * * * g[a]ve the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Fontaine, 138 A.3d at 760 (quoting Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 9 (R.I. 2015)). While the tax-sale statute itself may be draconian, this Court merely applies the law—it does not make it. And, moreover, the tax-sale statute is as clear today as it was when we decided Fontaine. 4 Crown Realty had twenty days to respond to the citation it received from Mr. Conley on July 6, 2018. It failed to do so and provided no justification for this failure. 5 As we 4', 'We observe that Mr. Conley purchased the property in May 2017, and Mr. Conley’s petition to foreclose was filed in June 2018. In July 2018, various changes to the statutory framework were made by the Legislature. See P.L. 2018, ch. 351, § 1. Nevertheless, we do not view any of those changes as affecting the outcome of this case, and the parties did not argue that the outcome was dependent upon which version of the statute applied. 5', 'Under the updated version of the law, it is unlikely that even adequate justification would suffice; G.L. 1956 § 44-9-29 now reads, in pertinent part:', '-6- stated in Fontaine, when an entity fails to provide adequate justification for a failure to respond by the return date, that entity is “in default under § 44-9-29 because of its failure to file an answer setting forth its right to the [p]roperty on or before the return date[.]” Id. at 761. Because Crown Realty was “in default under § 44-9-29[,]” it was proper for the justice of the Superior Court to enter a decree forever barring Crown Realty’s right of redemption. Id.; see § 44-9-30. 6', 'B', 'The Effect of the August 9 Redemption Statement', 'Crown Realty also argues that the e-mail it received from a paralegal in Mr. Conley’s office on August 9, which contained a redemption statement stating “INTEREST GOOD UNTIL August 18, 2018” and that “Judgment May Enter Against You, Unless Full Payment is Received[,]” created an implied-in-fact contract between Crown Realty and Mr. Conley, obligating Mr. Conley to allow redemption of the property. Crown Realty asserts that, even though it did not tender the payment until August 20, this does not defeat its claim of an implied contract', '“Any person claiming an interest, on or before the return day or', 'within that further time as may on motion be allowed by the court,', 'providing the motion is made prior to the fixed return day, shall, if', 'he or she desires to redeem, file an answer setting forth his or her', 'right in the land, and an offer to redeem upon the terms as may be', 'fixed by the court.” (Emphasis added.) 6', 'It is also noteworthy that, while the justice of the Superior Court clothed her ruling in terms of the Fontaine case, § 44-9-28, which was not directly discussed in Fontaine, is the provision entitling a petitioner to a decree pro confesso. That section states: “After the fixed return day, to be at least twenty (20) days after the time of the actual issuance of notice, the court * * * on motion of the petitioner shall enter an order defaulting all persons failing to file a timely answer, and decreeing that the petition as to them be taken as confessed[.]” Section 44-9-28. Moreover, § 44- 9-30, in addition to directing the Superior Court to enter a decree forever barring the right of redemption when “redemption is not made within the time and upon the terms fixed by the court under § 44-9-29,” also states that the court shall enter a decree forever barring the right of redemption “[i]f a default is entered under § 44-9-28[.]”', '-7- because August 18 was a Saturday and Mr. Souza made the payment on the next business day. Crown Realty also argues that its failure to comply with the deadline should not defeat its claim because the redemption statement, in Crown Realty’s words, “allowed Crown to make the payment until judgment was entered.” Moreover, Crown Realty argues that the delay should be forgiven because there was no indication that time was of the essence, and because performance within two days was reasonable. For his part, Mr. Conley argues that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the contract claim and that, even if it did, the redemption statement did not create contractual rights.', 'Generally, when we pass on whether an implied contract existed between parties in a non- jury case, we evaluate whether “the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.” Cote v. Aiello, 148 A.3d 537, 544 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Lamarque v. Centreville Savings Bank, 22 A.3d 1136, 1139-40 (R.I. 2011)). Nevertheless, in this case, the trial justice below did not make extensive findings of fact because she determined that she was without jurisdiction to rule on the question. The only finding she made related to the question was that “someone on [Mr. Conley’s] behalf[] had extended an offer to representatives of Crown Realty” beyond the original twenty day deadline and that offer “indicated that they would be willing to accept payment of [the] redemption figure, and that representatives of Crown Realty replied [sic] upon that; that they went out and got the check[.]”', 'Despite the dearth of factual findings on the particular issue, we are of the opinion that we have all the information we need to pass on this issue. That is so because we decline Crown Realty’s invitation to graft contract principles onto the strict and complex statutory framework governing tax sales and foreclosures, and we are not inclined to declare that the issuance of a redemption statement is an offer to allow a late redemption. Additionally, even if the redemption', '-8- statement constituted an offer, there existed no indication of mutual agreement. See Cote, 148 A.3d at 545 (explaining that mutual agreement must be found in order for an implied-in-fact contract to exist). This is demonstrated not only by Crown Realty’s payment to the Town of North Providence on August 10, one day after Mr. Conley’s office sent Mr. Souza the redemption statement, see Bailey v. West, 105 R.I. 61, 65, 249 A.2d 414, 416-17 (1969) (determining that there was no mutual agreement because, in part, the party asserting contract sent relevant bills to a third party), but also by Crown Realty’s failure to tender the check of $11,676.72 to Mr. Conley’s office until two days after the date listed on the redemption statement. In any event, we need say no more on the matter. No implied-in-fact contract existed between the parties.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, the decree of the Superior Court foreclosing Crown Realty’s right of redemption is affirmed.

According to Veronica, she sat on defendant’s left leg with her legs inside defendant’s legs and defendant’s left hand against her back. When her father went to look at defendant’s Chevrolet El Camino, which was parked in his driveway, out of defendant’s sight, defendant put his right hand under Veronica’s skirt and touched her vagina, over her underwear.

That is no mistake there.” (Emphasis added.) The defendant immediately objected. The trial justice reserved ruling on the objection. The prosecutor continued: “You know there is no mistake there. He knew what he was doing.” After the prosecutor concluded his closing argument, the trial justice called for a sidebar, and defendant moved to pass the case, arguing that the prosecutor was “basically testifying[,]” and making an “absolutely a hundred percent improper argument.” The defendant contended that the prosecutor improperly referred to that which he had personally observed, rather than to facts that were in the trial record. The defendant also argued that the prejudice caused by the statements was so significant that it could not be cured by an instruction. The state responded that the prosecutor’s remarks stemmed from defendant’s conduct and demeanor when Veronica left the stand—all of which occurred in the presence of the jury. The state further argued that, even if the remarks were inappropriate: “It’s only argument. I think the [c]ourt can instruct on that. I think a curative instruction would be fine. The [c]ourt is going to give an instruction that it’s only an argument. It’s not to be considered as evidence.”', 'The trial justice made the following ruling:', '“First of all, the [c]ourt finds that it was improper. The jury is', 'instructed from the beginning they can only consider answers to', 'questions from the witness stand and the exhibits. They cannot', 'consider anything else. Clearly, the prosecutor bringing up what', 'he observed or his observations is improper. The [c]ourt declines', 'to grant a mistrial. The [c]ourt will give a curative instruction to', 'the jury. The jury is aware closing arguments are not evidence.', 'The [c]ourt will instruct the jury to disregard. The [c]ourt', 'disagrees with defense counsel there is no other way to cure this.', '-7-', 'The [c]ourt has dealt with this exact issue and the [c]ourt will give', 'a curative instruction.” The trial justice proceeded to give the following curative instruction to the jury:', '“Members of the jury, before we take a brief break and come back', 'and give you the instructions, there was a comment made by the', 'prosecutor during the closing argument that dealt with an', 'observation of staring down or something to that [e]ffect. You', 'know what I’m referring to. First of all, as I told you before the', 'closings are not evidence. The defense closing is not evidence and', 'the [s]tate’s is not evidence. It’s what you heard from the witness', 'stand. I have also told you that the evidence is what you heard', 'from the witness stand and the statements. It’s not nothing [sic]', 'else that occurs in the courtroom itself. So I am going to instruct', 'you specifically that you must disregard that statement. Now as I', 'said, you wouldn’t be considering it as evidence anyway because', 'the closing is not evidence. But I am specifically going to instruct', 'you that you must disregard that statement. It’s up to you, the jury,', 'in terms of the witnesses, the evidence, the weight that you give', 'that and so I give you that instruction.” The defendant did not object to the instruction.', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant submits that the trial justice abused his discretion in failing to pass the case after the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument about defendant’s courtroom demeanor and behavior toward Veronica. The defendant argues that there is no evidence in the record to support the prosecutor’s representation that defendant glared at Veronica when she left the witness stand, and that the prosecutor inserted his personal observations into the record, which deprived defendant of his right to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the evidence presented at trial. Moreover, defendant argues that the instruction that was given could not cure the prejudice that this remark generated. We agree.', 'A criminal trial is a search for the truth. State v. Pacheco, 161 A.3d 1166, 1177 (R.I. 2017). “The purpose of closing argument is ‘to sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by', '-8- the trier of fact in a criminal case.’” State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975)). “Only after all the evidence has been presented are counsel for the parties in a position to present their respective versions of the case as a whole.” Id. “Only then can they argue the inferences to be drawn from all the testimony and point out the weaknesses of their adversaries’ positions.” Id.

(brackets omitted) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). “The probable effect of the prosecutorial statements on the outcome of the case must be evaluated by examining the remarks in the context in which they were made.” Id. (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885).', 'On numerous occasions, this Court has been called upon to examine purportedly improper statements by a prosecutor during closing argument. See, e.g., Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165; State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 561 (R.I. 2014); State v. Vieira, 38 A.3d 18, 21 (R.I. 2012); Boillard, 789 A.2d at 884. In Boillard, the defendant was convicted of first-degree and second-degree child molestation. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 882. One of the victims testified that she had witnessed the defendant’s daughter performing a sexual act on the defendant. Id. at 884. The victim also testified that, when she confronted the defendant’s daughter about what she had seen and whether it happened often, the daughter responded, “only when I see my [d]ad.” Id. During', '-9- the daughter’s testimony, however, she denied ever having sexual contact with her father. Id. In closing argument, the prosecutor specifically addressed the daughter’s testimony and suggested that she may have “repressed” the memories or did not remember them. Id. The defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Id. The prosecutor proceeded to discuss the inconsistencies in the testimony of the victim and the defendant’s daughter. Id. at 884-85. Once again, the defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Id. at 885. We held that the trial justice did not err in overruling the defendant’s objections because the prosecutor’s statements suggesting possible explanations for the obvious inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses, “though conjectural, were within the array of reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the facts presented at trial, and they were neither extraneous nor inflammatory.” Id. at 885-86.', 'More recently, in Lastarza, we examined the issue of allegedly improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165. There, the prosecutor made several statements during closing argument related to the defendant’s acts of dishonesty and criminal history; the prosecutor called the defendant a “thief,” a “career thief,” a “scam artist,” and a “con artist.” Id. This Court concluded that the statements did not warrant a mistrial because they “were based in large part upon the evidence and testimony adduced at trial.” Id. In that case, the defendant took the stand at trial, placing his credibility before the jury, and volunteered information about his past crimes and acts of dishonesty. Id. at 1166. Thus, we determined that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion to pass the case because the prosecutor’s statements were not “totally extraneous to the issues in the case,” and because the “remarks specifically addressed defendant’s performance on the witness stand[.]” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885).', '- 10 -', 'In both Boillard and Lastarza, the prosecutor’s remarks were directed to information and facts that had been revealed on the witness stand in the presence of the jury. The prosecutor’s statements in the case at bar diverge from our holdings in the Boillard line of cases because they were not based on the evidence or testimony at trial. Indeed, the prosecutor’s remarks about defendant’s demeanor have no support in the record, because defendant did not place his credibility at issue by testifying at trial. Cf. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1166 (where the prosecutor’s remarks “specifically addressed the defendant’s performance on the witness stand”). Nor did defendant have an opportunity to refute the prosecutor’s allegation that defendant “stared her down” as she was walking out of the courtroom. Moreover, the prosecutor’s statements were not “within the array of reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the facts presented at trial”; rather, the statements were based solely on the prosecutor’s own observations. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 886. As a result, the prosecutor’s statements—which placed the purported conduct of defendant before the jury without any evidentiary support—impacted defendant’s Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial and may have influenced the jury’s verdict. Additionally, the context in which the remarks were made is notable because the prosecutor’s comments struck at the heart of the defense’s theory at trial—that the alleged assault was an accident. The prosecutor pointed to defendant’s courtroom demeanor as evidence that defendant’s actions were not accidental or mistaken. This is simply not allowed.', 'We are of the opinion that the prosecutor’s statements exceeded the “considerable latitude” he was allowed because his statements were not based on evidence or testimony adduced at trial, were extraneous to the issues in the case, and had the potential for unfair prejudice. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1166. We are also satisfied that a curative instruction could not', '- 11 - overcome the prejudice in this case. Thus, we conclude that the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'Rule 404(b) Evidence', 'After the police raid and child pornography investigation, defendant was charged with one count of possession of child pornography. On May 9, 2016, he entered a plea of nolo contendere to that charge and received a four-year suspended sentence.', 'Before the trial in the present case, defendant filed motions in limine to preclude the state from introducing evidence or testimony concerning the child pornography case against defendant in accordance with Rule 403, Rule 404, and Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and, further, to preclude the state from introducing the statements made by defendant to Det. Petit in the course of the child pornography investigation. The state countered that statements made by the accused were admissible because they were admissions, and that the child pornography evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b) to establish intent, absence of mistake, and defendant’s lewd disposition toward Veronica. The trial justice ruled that defendant’s prior conviction of possession of child pornography was admissible to show intent under Rule 404(b), but reserved ruling on the remaining evidence in defendant’s motions in limine.', 'The parties thereafter filed a written stipulation concerning defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to the possession of child pornography charge. During trial, the trial justice read the stipulation to the jury:', '“So the stipulation is: ‘The parties hereby stipulate to the', 'following:', '“‘(1.) That on May 9, 2016, Henry Bozzo before a justice', 'of the Superior Court pled nolo contendere to one count of', 'possession of child pornography and was sentenced to four years', 'suspended sentence and four years of probation with specific', 'conditions of the sentence and probation.’', '- 12 -', '“It also states, ‘Agreed to by the parties on 10/26/16,’ and', 'it’s signed by both the [s]tate and the defense attorneys. Also', 'attached to that stipulation is a document referred to as a judgment', 'of conviction and commitment, which basically just goes through', 'what I read to you here.” The trial justice then instructed the jury to consider the stipulated evidence only for determining the element of intent. The instruction was as follows:', '“Now, in certain cases the jury is allowed to hear and consider', '[evidence] about a prior conviction of the defendant on trial, but I', 'specifically inform you that you cannot use the fact that someone', 'was convicted on a prior occasion as evidence of what we call', 'propensity, and what that basically means is for the jury to say', 'because someone did something one time, they m[u]st have done it', 'this time as well. So you cannot use it for that purpose. However,', 'the law does allow the jury to use it to make certain determinations', 'in the case. In this case the jury is going to need to determine what', 'is referred to as intent. Intent to commit a crime or intent to', 'commit the acts charged. The jury is permitted to take this into', 'consideration when making their determination in terms of', 'intent[.]”', 'Later at trial, Det. Petit gave lengthy testimony about the child pornography investigation, including the statements made by defendant and the nature of the evidence obtained in the course of the investigation. Detective Petit testified that, at the time of the assault on Veronica, he was assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC), an agency made up of local, state, and federal law-enforcement officers charged with investigating crimes against children. He then described how the ICAC investigates child pornography cases.', 'At that point, the trial justice called the parties to sidebar. The defendant objected to the admission of any child pornography evidence, stating:', '“We want to have excluded the fact of exactly that it was not the', 'nature of a video that was found on Mr. Bozzo’s computer. We', 'stipulated to the fact that he admitted to possessing child', 'pornography, but we never said what that child pornography was.” The trial justice disagreed and ruled that the evidence was admissible under Rule 404.', '- 13 -', 'The state proceeded to present detailed and highly prejudicial testimony about this unrelated case. Detective Petit indicated that the ICAC received four tips about a certain IP address that was linked to child pornography, and that they determined that the IP address was linked to defendant, which led to the search of defendant’s residence on September 2, 2015.2 Detective Petit testified that the first interview of defendant occurred at his home after his arrest. Detective Petit then discussed the statements about child pornography made by defendant during that interview. According to Det. Petit, defendant admitted that he was familiar with the child pornography video that led to the tip, which depicted “a little girl in there masturbating[.]” He also testified that defendant admitted that he had watched videos of preteen girls having sex and that he “viewed [child pornography] everyday[.]”', 'When Det. Petit asked him if child pornography was sexually gratifying, defendant responded: “It’s not like I’m masturbating to it every time.” Detective Petit testified that defendant informed him that he frequented illicit websites containing graphic videos and images of minors, and that defendant admitted that he “searches whatever he can for [child pornography].” 2', 'The prosecutor and Det. Petit engaged in the following colloquy:', '“[PROSECUTOR]: What lead you to speak to Mr. Bozzo?', '“[DET.

PETIT]: That’s correct.”', '- 14 -', 'At that point, the trial justice provided another cautionary instruction to the jury, and the prosecutor then continued his direct examination of Det. Petit, who proceeded to describe his second interview with defendant. Detective Petit testified that, during that interview, defendant admitted to downloading about a hundred videos of child pornography on his computer and that he had “a lot of fantasies” about those videos. Detective Petit later confirmed the existence of those videos on defendant’s hard drive, including more than one video of girls under the age of ten. According to Det. Petit, defendant stated that he was attracted to girls between seven and fifteen years old.', 'Although these interviews took place before Veronica’s father had reported the incident to law enforcement, Det. Petit testified that defendant talked about Veronica during the second meeting. According to Det. Petit, defendant stated that Veronica “was a beautiful girl[,]” that he was attracted to her, and that he enjoyed when Veronica sat on his lap.

The stipulation made clear that defendant was not contesting the issue. This evidence therefore had no bearing on the remaining issues in the case. By contrast, the evidence that was admitted about the child pornography case was highly prejudicial and created a real risk of juror confusion.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On May 11, 2011, Michael DiRaimo’s throat was slashed and his dwelling burned. On May 25, 2012, defendant was charged by indictment with murder and arson. A jury trial was held over three days in June 2016. At trial, the state presented testimony from six individuals. The testimony revealed the following.', 'On May 11, 2011, at 10:01 p.m., the fire department was called to 39 Sophia Street in Providence. Sean Reddy, who was an arson investigator in the Providence fire department, arrived at the scene at about 10:30 p.m. Reddy responded to that address to conduct “an origin cause', '-1- investigation to the fire.” Upon viewing the interior of the burned structure, he observed a “male deceased victim lying on the floor.” The victim was positioned face down. In accordance with protocol, the Office of the State Fire Marshal and the Office of the Medical Examiner were notified.', 'As part of his investigation, Reddy began “removing [the] debris from the fire scene[.]” During that process, Reddy noticed a laceration on the victim’s neck and a “substantial amount of blood” underneath him. At that point, Reddy “immediately stop[ped,] * * * removed [himself] from the scene[,] and made the appropriate notifications to make sure everyone was aware of what [he] just observed[.]”', 'Reddy testified that the victim’s throat was slashed from right to left, “almost a complete[] 360 around his neck.” With respect to the fire, Reddy classified it as “an incendiary arson fire[,]” having two separate points of origin.', 'Alexander Chirkov, M.D. was the acting Chief Medical Examiner for Rhode Island at the time of trial; he was an assistant medical examiner in 2011. He testified that on May 12, 2011, he was present at the autopsy of an individual identified as Michael DiRaimo.1 The post-mortem examination revealed that DiRaimo was a white male, about forty-one years of age, who was “covered with soot[,] and [there was] evidence of first[,] second[,] and third degree burn [sic]” over his entire body. The interior of his neck was cut, and he had two four-centimeter puncture wounds on the palm of his right hand. DiRaimo’s neck wound was a twelve-inch “cut wound on [the] interior neck from right to left, up to the anterior neck to the spinal vertebrae. * * * [I]n depth we’re talking about [the] entire thickness of the anterior neck.” The wound dissected the victim’s 1', 'Doctor Chirkov was in the autopsy room when George Lauro, M.D., who has since passed away, conducted the autopsy. Doctors Lauro and Chirkov had discussed the findings from the autopsy after its conclusion.', '-2- jugular vein, trachea,2 and carotid artery. Doctor Chirkov testified that the wounds on the victim’s hand were “classified as defensive wound[s] where the person tried to protect himself using his hands.”', 'The autopsy also disclosed that there was no evidence of smoke inhalation, soot, or ashes in DiRaimo’s throat, and that carbon dioxide levels in his blood were less than 0.1 percent—an amount consistent with a chronic smoker. Doctor Chirkov testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the cause of DiRaimo’s death was blood loss due to the wound to his neck. Doctor Chirkov testified that the manner of DiRaimo’s death was homicide.', 'Detective Kenneth Court of the Providence police department testified that on May 11, 2011, he responded to 39 Sophia Street to investigate DiRaimo’s death. Detective Court testified that there were no eyewitness accounts of either the arson or the homicide. Further, Det. Court testified that, to his knowledge, no murder weapon was found and defendant’s DNA was not found at the crime scene. During his search for a suspect following the murder, Det. Court requested the victim’s cell-phone records—phone calls, text messages, and cell-tower location information—for the period from April 16, 2011, to his death on May 11, 2011. A review of the victim’s phone records revealed text and call communications between DiRaimo’s cell-phone number and Gumkowski’s cell-phone number. The trial justice permitted both the full call and text-message records between DiRaimo’s phone and anyone with whom he was in contact, as well as an “outline” of all text messages and phone calls sent and received exclusively between defendant and DiRaimo from April 16 through May 11 to be admitted into evidence as full exhibits. 3 2', 'The trachea is colloquially known as the windpipe or air pipe. 3', 'The state introduced the full subpoenaed text and call history into evidence, without objection.

The text message history portrayed a relationship between DiRaimo and defendant involving drugs and sex—with DiRaimo supplying the drugs in exchange for Gumkowski’s sexual favors.', 'Further, while DiRaimo occasionally referenced their sexual relationship in text messages, Gumkowski’s texts to DiRaimo reveal that Gumkowski was concerned about the information disclosed in the messages. The day before DiRaimo was killed, Gumkowski objected to DiRaimo commenting by text message about their planned sex-for-drugs exchange; in response to Gumkowski asking DiRaimo if he still had “the 4 blue & 20[,]” DiRaimo confirmed, “Yes u got ur hands and mouth right lol[,]” but Gumkowski objected to DiRaimo’s sexual reference, exclaiming, “dont write that shit mikey what if sum1 read ur phone!!”', 'A text message conversation that lasted from the evening before the homicide until the early morning on the day of the murder implied that a planned exchange between DiRaimo and Gumkowski had gone awry.

For example, DiRaimo, via text message at 9:35 p.m. on May 10, 2011, threatened to call Gumkowski “all nite” when he believed that Gumkowski had stolen drugs from him, and then proceeded to place approximately sixty calls to Gumkowski between 10:12 and 10:56 that night. Most of those calls were unanswered, but Gumkowski did place a seventeen-second call to DiRaimo at 10:25 that night.', 'Detective Court testified that the last phone call from DiRaimo to Gumkowski was at 8:42:19 p.m. on May 11—the night of the arson and homicide—about an hour and twenty minutes before the fire department was alerted. That call lasted fifty-one seconds. After that 8:42 p.m. call, there were two more incoming calls to DiRaimo’s phone that night that “have a corresponding tower[,]” indicating that DiRaimo’s phone was on. Those calls occurred at 9:43:25 p.m. and 10:45:26 p.m. on May 11, 2011, and corresponded to cell tower numbers seventy-three and fifty- nine, respectively.', 'The location of cell tower number seventy-three is on Briggs Street in Cranston, and cell tower number fifty-nine is on Old Switch Road in Hopkinton. The arson and murder occurred at 39 Sophia Street, Providence—near cell tower seventy-three. And, at the time, Gumkowski resided about forty miles away in a house on Spring Street in Hopkinton. The location of cell tower number fifty-nine is within a mile of Gumkowski’s residence in Hopkinton, where Det. Court ultimately discovered DiRaimo’s cell phone among Gumkowski’s belongings on August 3, 2011. At least another twenty calls to DiRaimo’s cell phone, between May 12 and May', '-7- 18, 2011, did not have corresponding towers, which, Det. Court testified, indicates that the phone was turned off sometime after the call that was received at 10:45:26 p.m. on May 11.', 'After Det. Court discovered DiRaimo’s cell phone at the place where defendant had resided at the time of the murder, Detective Ralph Costantino, a crime scene investigator who is employed by the Providence police department in the Bureau of Criminal Identification, examined the phone in Det. Court’s presence. Detective Court testified that, when Det. Costantino powered up the phone, the phone displayed DiRaimo’s phone number. Further, when Det. Costantino opened the phone and removed the battery, Det. Court observed that the serial number matched DiRaimo’s phone’s serial number, indicating that the phone was, in fact, DiRaimo’s phone. Detective Costantino took a DNA sample from Gumkowski, and he also took four swab samples off the phone to test for DNA.', 'Tamara Wong, senior forensic scientist at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Science Laboratory, testified as an expert in the field of forensic DNA. Wong developed a DNA profile for Gumkowski using the sample that Det. Costantino had taken from Gumkowski. She was unable to produce a profile from three of the four samples that Det. Costantino had taken from the phone, but one sample from the back of the phone “resulted in a partial mix DNA profile.” Wong then compared the two samples and found that Gumkowski could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA that was found on the back of DiRaimo’s cell phone. In fact, she found that it “is 52 trillion times more likely” that Gumkowski did contribute to the partial DNA found on the back of DiRaimo’s cell phone than did some other unknown person. However, Wong testified on cross-examination that she could not determine when or how the DNA got on the phone.', '-8-', 'Julianna Hollister testified that, in 2011, Gumkowski lived with her and her husband on Spring Street in Hopkinton. In the spring of 2011, she asked Gumkowski to leave and not come back to the property, placed some of his clothing at the end of the driveway, and otherwise left the room in which Gumkowski had stayed untouched. Again, as Det. Court testified, the victim’s cell phone was discovered on August 3, 2011, in the room where Gumkowski had resided at the time of the murder.', 'After the state’s last witness testified, the defense rested. The jury returned with a guilty verdict on both counts on June 13, 2016. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The motion was heard on July 12, 2016, and the trial justice denied the motion in an oral decision rendered at the end of the hearing on the same day. The defendant was sentenced on September 6, 2016, to a mandatory life sentence for the first-degree murder conviction and a consecutive forty-five-year sentence for the first- degree arson conviction.6 Gumkowski filed the instant appeal on September 12, 2016.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The defendant appeals from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial. As we have oft repeated, “when a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, he or she acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Johnson, 199 A.3d 1046, 1050-51 (R.I. 2019) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 223 (R.I. 2015)). “The trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess 6', 'The defendant also had been convicted of similar, but unrelated, crimes in Massachusetts; and, as such, the trial justice ordered that these sentences are to “run consecutive to * * * the Massachusetts sentences.”', '-9- the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. at 1051 (brackets omitted) (quoting Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, must he or she embark on a fourth analytical step.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223).', '“This Court’s review of a denial of a motion for a new trial is deferential because the trial justice is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Johnson, 199 A.3d at 1051 (deletion omitted) (quoting Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she denied his motion for a new trial because, according to defendant, the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.7 Specifically, Gumkowski argues that the evidence did not support a finding that he was the murderer and that the evidence did not support a finding of premeditation beyond a reasonable 7', 'While defendant was convicted of first-degree arson, he does not provide an argument on appeal, beyond conclusory statements, that the guilty verdict pertaining to arson was against the weight of the evidence.', '- 10 - doubt. We begin by recognizing that, in this case, the “trial justice applied the correct standard for assessing the motion for a new trial and articulated sufficient grounds for denying the motion; [her] decision is therefore entitled to great weight and deference pursuant to our well established standard of review.” Johnson, 199 A.3d at 1051.', 'A', 'Gumkowski argues that the evidence did not support a finding that he was the perpetrator because: (1) the text messages did not prove motive; (2) the fact that DiRaimo’s cell phone was ultimately found among Gumkowski’s belongings supports, at most, a finding of theft; and (3) the excerpted text history between Gumkowski and DiRaimo entered by the state as a full exhibit was misleading because it led the jurors and the trial justice to overlook DiRaimo’s full text-message history—which was also entered as a full exhibit.', 'The crime of murder is defined, in relevant part, as “[t]he unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought * * *. Every murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing * * * is murder in the first degree. Any other murder is murder in the second degree.” General Laws 1956 § 11-23-1. “Although motive is not an essential element of murder, ‘evidence of motive is often probative and relevant, and therefore admissible in proper circumstances.’” State v. Pule, 453 A.2d 1095, 1098 (R.I. 1982) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 825 (1980)). In Pule, the Court held that “evidence of motive was admissible to prove that defendant was the person who committed the criminal act.” Id. (citing McCormick’s Handbook of the Law of Evidence § 190 at 450-51 (2d ed. Cleary 1972)).', 'The text messages between DiRaimo and Gumkowski depict a relationship that was based on drugs, sex, money, and secrets. The day before the murder, Gumkowski asked DiRaimo via', '- 11 - text message, “U got the 4 blue & 20 rite?”; to which the victim responded, “Yes u got ur hands and mouth right lol[.]” In response to the drugs-for-sex exchange DiRaimo was referencing, Gumkowski alluded to wanting to keep the sexual nature of their relationship secret: “Lol dont write that shit mikey what if sum1 read ur phone!!” DiRaimo responded, “Nobody ever reads my phone it is always with me[.]” Shortly thereafter, at around 9 p.m. on the day before DiRaimo was murdered, DiRaimo appeared to become increasingly enraged with Gumkowski, apparently accusing Gumkowski of taking DiRaimo’s drugs without having paid for them. In a period of little more than a half-hour, DiRaimo sent seventeen unanswered text messages to defendant, stating, inter alia: “Ur a piece of shit u robed me and i got 2 pay 4 Them now[,]” and “Ur a crackhead u piece of fucking shit i will get u i got 2 pay 4 that i know where u work and 4 who[.]”', 'On the day of the murder, at around noon, DiRaimo and Gumkowski had apparently reconciled enough to arrange for Gumkowski to meet with DiRaimo to pay for the drugs; however, by that evening, DiRaimo sent Gumkowski a slew of messages threatening Gumkowski, calling him names, and stating that he was only good for sexual favors. DiRaimo went on, at about 6 p.m., to threaten to reveal their sexual relationship to Gumkowski’s boss, the mother of his child, and the people with whom he lived.', 'Gumkowski replied, “Ok they all no!!” and “Ok[.]” Thereafter, Gumkowski apologized to DiRaimo and said that he would meet DiRaimo after he ate. By 6:47 p.m. on the day of the murder, Gumkowski texted DiRaimo that he was leaving to meet DiRaimo soon, and about an hour later Gumkowski texted, “U got the 7 still? Get a spoon * * * Im hurtin[.]”', 'The trial justice recounted these messages in her bench decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. In the process, she remarked that defendant’s apparently passive responses to DiRaimo’s threats to expose their sexual relationship seemed to contradict defendant’s earlier', '- 12 - concern about alluding to the sexual aspect of DiRaimo’s and Gumkowski’s relationship in text messages for fear that someone would see the messages. She also highlighted the fact that there were telephone calls—some lengthy—between DiRaimo and Gumkowski during this time period. Further, the trial justice found that “the jury reasonably inferred that [d]efendant had something to be concerned about, an angry and vengeful DiRaimo who was threatening to reveal information to others about [d]efendant * * * and [d]efendant knew it.” We are satisfied that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in concluding that the jury could have reasonably inferred motive from the text messages between DiRaimo and Gumkowski; as she stated, “the jury reasonably inferred as does the [c]ourt the [d]efendant went to DiRaimo’s house, killed him, set the house on fire to cover up the murder, took the phone and went home, and it was indeed the [d]efendant who took the phone.”', 'She also concluded that the jury was justified in finding that the evidence of DiRaimo’s cell-phone location based on the “pings” from the cell towers was credible and that the jury made a reasonable inference that Gumkowski took the phone from DiRaimo’s dwelling to his own residence, where the phone was eventually found. The text-message exchanges demonstrate that the trial justice did not misconceive the evidence when she concluded that the jury could have reasonably inferred that “DiRaimo never voluntarily would have given anyone his phone” and that “[e]ven if [defendant] killed DiRaimo and had left the phone behind, the damaging information would come out. He had motive to silence DiRaimo, and he had motive to steal the cell phone.”', 'The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred by reviewing only the text history between Gumkowski and DiRaimo, thus overlooking the complete record of DiRaimo’s text messages entered into evidence.8 According to defendant, DiRaimo’s entire text history reveals 8', 'While the trial justice admitted the excerpted text messages and phone calls over defendant’s objection pursuant to Rule 1006 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, we note that the excerpt was not admitted in lieu of the full text-message history, but in addition to it. See R.I. R. Evid.', '- 13 - him to be an opioid dealer who led a complicated and very stressful life. The complete messages, defendant asserts, demonstrate that DiRaimo was surrounded by a “constellation of troubled individuals” in a world where exchanges of drugs for sex were common. The defendant suggests that a number of men may have had a motive to murder DiRaimo.', 'The complete compilation of text messages that the state introduced into evidence is indeed voluminous. In her decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice carefully reviewed the communications between defendant and DiRaimo in the hours immediately before DiRaimo’s murder. She noted that DiRaimo was furious that defendant had not paid him for drugs, money that DiRaimo in turn owed to his own drug dealer. The trial justice reviewed the “pages and pages of text messages from DiRaimo to Gumkowski between 9:07 p.m. on May 10th and May 11th within the hour of the time of the murder.” The trial justice also referenced an additional sixty phone calls made by DiRaimo to defendant during this time period.', 'In addition, the trial justice noted the two incoming calls to DiRaimo’s cell phone that had pings off nearby cell towers: one at 9:30 p.m. near DiRaimo’s home, and one at 10:45 p.m. near the home where defendant was living in Hopkinton. The trial justice further noted that the fire at the location where DiRaimo was found murdered was reported during that time period, at 10:01 p.m. The trial justice did not indicate whether she relied solely or more heavily on either the state’s exhibit that outlined the text messages and phone calls between Gumkowski and DiRaimo or the exhibits that listed DiRaimo’s full call and text-message history. 1006 (“The contents of voluminous writings * * * which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court.”).', '- 14 -', 'Moreover, both the complete compilation and the excerpted text messages and phone calls were made available to the trial justice and the jury. In light of the overwhelming circumstantial evidence that places defendant at DiRaimo’s home prior to and around the time of the murder and fire, reflects DiRaimo’s increasing anger at defendant in the hours leading up to the murder, and demonstrates that DiRaimo’s cell phone was eventually retrieved with defendant’s belongings, we are convinced that neither the trial justice nor the jury were misled by the state’s exhibit outlining only the text messages between defendant and DiRaimo.', 'B', 'Gumkowski also asserts that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because the evidence did not support a finding of premeditation.9 In clarifying the meaning of “premeditation” in State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969 (R.I. 2008), this Court focused on “the duration of the defendant’s intent to kill” when distinguishing between first- and second-degree murder. Gillespie, 960 A.2d at 977. In that case, this Court stated that “[f]irst-degree murder requires that the defendant harbored a more-than-momentary intent to kill prior to committing the homicide—in essence, that he or she acted with premeditation.” Id. In other words, “[t]he premeditation necessary to establish first-degree murder must have existed for some appreciable length of time before the killing; it must have existed for more than just a moment.” State v. Amazeen, 526 A.2d 1268, 1271 (R.I. 1987). On the other hand, if the intent only “involves a fleeting intent that is 9', 'The state responds in its submission to this Court that defendant has waived the issue of “[i]nsufficient evidence of premeditation[.]” As defendant points out, however, Gumkowski never argued, and does not now argue, that he is entitled to a new trial based on the insufficiency of the evidence, but instead filed and argued his motion for a new trial based solely on a weight-of-the- evidence argument.', '- 15 - contemporaneous with the murder[,]” then the defendant would be found guilty of second-degree murder. Gillespie, 960 A.2d at 977.', 'The defendant argues that the evidence did not support a finding of premeditation for three reasons: (1) there was no evidence of planning; (2) no reasonable juror could infer premeditation from the text messages between DiRaimo and defendant; and (3) there is no evidence indicating that the defensive wounds on DiRaimo’s hand would have taken more than a mere moment to inflict, and thus should have been considered “simultaneous or near-simultaneous injuries[.]” Evidence of a plan, however, is not a requirement for proving premeditation. See Gillespie, 960 A.2d at 977. Nor did defendant need to have formed the intent to kill DiRaimo during their text or phone conversations. All that is needed is for defendant to have “harbored a more-than- momentary intent to kill prior to committing the homicide[.]” Id.', 'The defendant made only a passing reference to premeditation in his oral argument in support of the motion for a new trial. The trial justice did address this issue, however, in her decision; therefore we are satisfied that it has been preserved for appellate review. On appeal, defendant argues that there was no evidence of any planning or preparation, and no evidence that the perpetrator even brought a weapon to the scene. Nor do the text messages provide evidence of premeditation or the act of killing itself, according to defendant. We disagree.', 'The trial justice remarked in her decision: “The evidence was overwhelming that someone committed first degree murder in the killing of Michael DiRaimo. His throat was slashed almost from ear to ear. It was particularly malicious.” Indeed, the photographs admitted into evidence suggest a near decapitation. Doctor Chirkov, whom the trial justice characterized as a credible witness, testified that DiRaimo had a twelve-inch wound on his neck, the depth of which was “about [the] entire thickness of the anterior neck[,]” which dissected “the jugular vein on the right', '- 16 - with dissection of the air pipe and dissection of the carotid artery.” Doctor Chirkov further testified that the autopsy disclosed two puncture wounds on the palm surface of the deceased’s right hand. He commented that “usually this type of wound [is] classified as a defensive wound where the person tried to protect himself using his hands.”', 'We are of the opinion that it was reasonable for the trial justice and jury to conclude that, as the trial justice noted in her bench decision denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial, this homicide “was done with more than a moment’s reflection.” The defensive wounds on DiRaimo’s hand, together with the vicious, forceful nature of the throat slashing, supports a finding of a murder that was “willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated[.]” Section 11-23-1. The trial justice did not “overlook[] or misconceive[] material evidence[,]” nor was she “otherwise clearly wrong.” Johnson, 199 A.3d at 1051 (quoting Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223). In fact, she “articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion,” and thus “her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court[.]” Id.

These consolidated cases come before this Court on appeal from an April 20, 2017 order of the Providence County Superior Court denying the motions for entry of judgment filed by former Central Falls Mayor Charles Moreau and former members of the Central Falls City Council (the City Council) (collectively, the elected officials).1 The rationale for said denial was set forth in a February 21, 2017 decision of the 1', 'No doubt due to their importance and complexity, these consolidated cases have remained pending for nearly ten years. However, in that time, many of the elected officials involved in the case no longer hold political office or have moved on to different political offices. For the purposes of the issue currently before us, we need not engage in specifying the ever-changing parties in this case. It suffices to say that, on appeal, the appellants represent that', '-1- Superior Court; specifically, that decision held that the elected officials were not entitled to indemnification from the State of Rhode Island2 for attorneys’ fees and legal costs that they incurred over the course of this action. On appeal, the elected officials contend that the hearing justice erred in holding that the elected officials were not entitled to indemnification from the state because, in the view of the elected officials, this Court’s previous opinion in Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1 (R.I. 2015) (Shine I), provided for such an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. The elected officials further contend that a suit against a receiver appointed pursuant to the terms of G.L. 1956 chapter 9 of title 45 (the Financial Stability Act)3 is a suit against the state, and that fact, in their opinion, entitles them to indemnification from the state.', 'These cases came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in these appeals should not be summarily decided. After considering the written and oral submissions of the parties and after a the appealing parties are former Mayor Charles Moreau and numerous former members of the Central Falls City Council (William Benson, Jr.; Richard Aubin, Jr.; Eunice DeLaHoz; and Patrick J. Szlastha), as well as an interested party—Attorney Lawrence Goldberg, the attorney for the City Council. We refer to those parties collectively as “the elected officials.” For a more detailed recitation of the parties to this case and its procedural history, we refer the interested reader to our opinion in Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1 (R.I. 2015) (Shine I). 2', 'The appellee in this action is the Department of Revenue for the State of Rhode Island, by and through its Director, Mark A. Furcolo.

Flanders, 15 A.3d 565 (R.I. 2011) (Flanders) and Shine I. All that is necessary to the resolution of these appeals is a brief recitation of the procedural posture of the cases. In so doing, we rely primarily on our previous opinions and various documents from the record.', 'In July of 2010, a receiver was appointed for the fiscally-troubled City of Central Falls (the City) pursuant to the then-new Financial Stability Act. These cases arose out of conflicts between the receiver on the one hand and the Mayor and City Council on the other. Essentially, these cases required a determination as to the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act under which the receiver was appointed. This Court ultimately held the Financial Stability Act to be constitutional in our opinion in Flanders. Flanders, 15 A.3d at 574-89.', 'Thereafter, the parties continued to litigate about the issues of attorneys’ fees and indemnification. The cases returned to this Court, and we then opined that the receiver was not entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, that Mayor Moreau was entitled to indemnification for his', '-3- legal fees and costs, and that the attorney for the City Council was entitled to recover his fees.4 Shine I, 119 A.3d at 8-19.', 'The parties come before us now with respect to a dispute as to who is required to indemnify the elected officials for their legal fees and costs—does the liability rest solely with the City, or the City and the state?', 'This Court is aware that the City was engaged in a proceeding in bankruptcy court, but what transpired there has no bearing on the issue before us. Based on the record and exhibits before this Court on appeal, it is clear that, in conjunction with that proceeding, the elected officials entered into a settlement with the City with respect to indemnification and released all their remaining claims against the City. Therefore, any claims for indemnity against the City are not before us. We are concerned only with determining whether the elected officials are also entitled to indemnification from the state.', 'In June of 2016, the elected officials filed separate motions for entry of judgment in Superior Court, contending, for what seems to this Court to have been the first time, that they were also entitled to indemnification from the state. The Department of Revenue, on behalf of the state, opposed the motions. On February 21, 2017, the hearing justice issued a written decision on the elected officials’ motions for entry of judgment. He denied the motions for entry of judgment, holding that “[a] plain reading of the statute and City Ordinance [at issue] require the City of Central Falls, not the State, to indemnify the Mayor and the City Council members 4', 'Our specific mandate reads as follows:', '“These cases may be remanded to [the Superior Court] for: (1) the', 'entry of summary judgment in accordance with this opinion; (2) a', 'determination of the amount of indemnification that the Mayor is', 'entitled to receive; and, (3) the amount of attorneys’ fees that', 'Attorney Goldberg is entitled to receive.” Shine I, 119 A.3d at 19.', '-4- who brought this lawsuit in their official capacities.” An order entered to that effect on April 20, 2017.5 The elected officials filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We begin by noting that there do not appear to be any factual issues in dispute in these cases. We are primarily tasked with a pure question of law—i.e., explicating our previous decision in Shine I and the legal authorities on which it was based.

However, in this Court’s opinion, the order clearly has such an element of finality as to be appealable, since it represents the final decision on the issue of the elected officials’ alleged right to be indemnified by the state. See Town of Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 118 R.I. 644, 648, 375 A.2d 410, 412-13 (1977) (“[W]e will review an order or decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, does possess such an element of finality that action is called for before the case is finally terminated in order to prevent clearly imminent and irreparable harm.”).

In the judgment of this Court, that opinion is abundantly clear and leaves no room for doubt—the elected officials are entitled to indemnification from the City but not from the state.', 'In reaching our final determination in Shine I with respect to the legal fees and costs accrued by Mayor Moreau and Attorney Goldberg, we relied primarily on one statutory section and three City Ordinances. We deem it instructive to review those sources in more detail.', 'First, the Court relied upon G.L. 1956 § 45-15-16, which provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“All * * * city council[s] * * * shall * * * indemnify any and all', '* * * public employees * * * [and] officials * * * from all loss,', 'cost, expense, and damage, including legal fees and court costs, if', 'any, arising out of any * * * action * * * by reason of any', 'intentional tort or by reason of any alleged error or misstatement or', 'action or omission, or neglect or violation of the rights of any', 'person under any federal or state law, including misfeasance,', 'malfeasance, or nonfeasance * * * if the elected or appointed * * *', 'official * * * at the time of the intentional tort or act, omission or', 'neglect, was acting within the scope of his or her official duties or', 'employment.

The', 'indemnity shall be provided by the city * * * council * * * on a', 'case by case basis or by ordinance of general application. The', 'ordinance or agreement to indemnify shall include, among other', 'things, the provision of legal counsel at the expense of the city or', 'town and/or the reimbursement for attorneys’ fees and other', 'expenses incurred in connection with the conduct of the defense,', 'including payment of the judgment.” (Emphasis added.)', '-6- This Court further relied upon the Central Falls Code of Ordinances, Chap. 2, Art. III, Div. 3, § 2-108 (City Ordinance) which provided as follows:', '“The city shall indemnify any and all public employees [and]', 'officials * * * from all loss, cost, expense and damage, including', 'legal fees and court costs, if any, arising out of any * * * action', '* * * by reason of any intentional tort or by reason of any alleged', 'error or misstatement or action or omission, or neglect or violation', 'of the rights of any person under any federal or state law, including', 'misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance * * * if such employee', '[or] official * * * at the time of such intentional tort or act,', 'omission or neglect, was acting within the scope of his official', 'duties or employment.” (Emphasis added.) City Ordinance § 2-109 provided as follows:', '“The city shall decline to indemnify any such employee [or]', 'official * * * for any misstatement, error, act, omission or neglect', 'if the same resulted from willful, wanton or malicious conduct on', 'the part of such employee [or] official * * *. The city council shall', 'decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether indemnification should be', 'allowed or declined.” (Emphasis added.) Lastly, City Ordinance 2-110(b) states that, “[t]he city council shall have the authority to approve or deny any and all requests for outside legal counsel on a case-by-case basis.” (Emphasis added.)', 'It is clear beyond peradventure to any reader that every just-quoted statutory or ordinance section applied specifically to the city, the town, the municipality, or the city council. Absolutely nowhere in those legislative provisions is there any language that could even remotely lead to a rational conclusion that indemnification for the elected officials should come from the state as well as the municipality or the City Council. To so conclude would fly in the face of the sources relied upon by this Court in Shine I. Nor have we been able to locate any other language in Shine I that would lead to a conclusion that the elected officials were entitled to indemnification from the state. This Court’s opinion in Shine I is plainly restricted to the City.', '-7- For that reason, the elected officials’ argument that this Court in Shine I mandated indemnification from the state and that the Superior Court defied this Court’s mandate in not so holding is unavailing.', 'The elected officials further aver as follows: (1) “[t]he Receiver, who was at all times an instrumentality of the State in the relevant litigation below [having been appointed by the state’s Director of Revenue], precipitated the litigation against the Appellants, and the State was directly responsible for the costs and expenses incurred by the Appellants for which they seek indemnification;” (2) pursuant to the Financial Stability Act, “[Mayor] Moreau was effectively stripped of his elected Mayoral position * * * and became relegated to an advisor to the Receiver and, therefore, also an instrumentality of the State;” (3) “the Mayor’s and City Council’s actions in challenging the [Financial Stability Act] were, in substantial part, in furtherance of and required pursuant to their sworn duties and obligations to uphold the laws and the Constitution of this State, in addition to their duties to the City of Central Falls;” and (4) “the exceptionally unique and unprecedented circumstances and complex legal issues presented by this litigation warrant the indemnification sought by the Appellants pursuant to the Supreme Court’s inherent equitable authority to fashion an appropriate remedy.”', 'We do not find any of those arguments convincing given the clear language of this Court’s opinion in Shine I. What is more, we note that the receiver, even though he was appointed by the state, essentially stood in the shoes of the Mayor and City Council. See § 45-9-7(c) (“Upon the appointment of a receiver, the receiver shall have the right to exercise the powers of the elected officials * * *; provided, further, that the powers of the receiver shall be superior to and supersede the powers of the elected officials of the city, town, or fire district shall continue to be elected in accordance with the city or town or fire district charter, and shall serve', '-8- in an advisory capacity to the receiver. * * * In the event a conflict arises between the chief elected official or city or town council or fire district governing body and the receiver, the receiver’s decision shall prevail.”); see also Francis v. Buttonwood Realty Co., 765 A.2d 437, 443 (R.I. 2001) (“[T]he status of a receiver has been described as that of one who stands in the shoes of the person over whose estate he has been appointed, and is clothed with only such rights of action as might have been maintained by such person.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The receiver was, for all intents and purposes, the City.6 Thus, the elected officials’ arguments that the receiver was somehow de facto acting on behalf of the state or as an instrumentality of the state certainly do not carry the day. Additionally, we perceive no basis for acceding to the elected officials’ invitation to invoke our inherent equitable authority to fashion an appropriate remedy in this instance.', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, it is abundantly clear that this Court’s opinion in Shine I provided for indemnification to the elected officials from the City but not from the state. As such, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the elected officials’ motions for entry of judgment.', 'This case represents the third time that this Court has been asked to opine on issues which arose in the context of this lengthy disagreement over the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act and the indemnification of Mayor Moreau and members of the City Council for challenging the constitutionality of that act in court. While we commend all parties for their zealous and helpful advocacy throughout the pendency of this case, we are hopeful that this opinion provides an ending to this action. See Arena v.

Mahoney, M.D. (Dr. Mahoney) (collectively defendants).', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the case at this time. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In April 2012, plaintiff’s mother, Joyce Willner (Joyce),1 was admitted to South County Hospital for complications stemming from pneumonia. Her health quickly deteriorated, and she 1', 'For the sake of clarity, we refer to plaintiff’s mother and to his mother’s husband by their first names; we intend no disrespect by doing so.', '-1- was transferred to general inpatient hospice, located in South County Hospital and operated by Home & Hospice Care. After Joyce was admitted to hospice, a disagreement arose between plaintiff, who misrepresented himself to hospital staff as holding Joyce’s durable power of attorney for health care, and Joyce’s husband, Kurt Willner (Kurt), over the plan of care for Joyce. This led to Kurt presenting a valid durable power of attorney for health care document to hospital staff, who, at that point, recognized Kurt as the controlling authority to make decisions about Joyce’s care. Indeed, plaintiff did not hold Joyce’s medical power of attorney, and did not become Joyce’s guardian until later, in 2014. Undaunted, plaintiff continued to oppose the medical care that was provided to Joyce, and he became increasingly aggressive and disruptive, to the point where hospital staff informed him that he would be removed from the premises if his behavior continued. In turn, Kurt instructed hospital staff to withhold all information regarding Joyce’s medical care from plaintiff. Joyce’s health eventually and unexpectedly improved, and she was discharged from hospice in May 2012.', 'On April 23, 2015, plaintiff filed a pro se complaint against South County Hospital and Home & Hospice Care. The plaintiffs were listed as “Michael A. Willner, individually and as guardian and next best friend of Joyce C. Willner, and Joyce C.

Because plaintiff was an attorney and member of the District of Columbia Bar, he then filed a motion to represent the Guardianship pro hac vice on December 14, 2017. That motion was denied on January 22, 2018.', 'Despite the trial justice’s order denying plaintiff’s motion to appear pro hac vice on behalf of the Guardianship, plaintiff did not retain counsel and continued to act as counsel for the Guardianship. For example, plaintiff deposed the representative of South County Hospital and noticed the deposition of Dr. Mahoney. As a result, in April 2018, Dr. Mahoney and Home & Hospice Care filed motions to disqualify plaintiff from acting as attorney for the Guardianship and to hold him in contempt for failing to comply with the trial justice’s January 22, 2018 order. The defendants also filed a joint motion to strike the pleadings filed on behalf of the Guardianship. The trial justice granted the motion to disqualify and denied the motion to hold plaintiff in contempt on April 30, 2018, and granted the motion to strike on May 2, 2018. The trial justice also ordered plaintiff to obtain counsel for the Guardianship within thirty days.

In other words, plaintiff contends that he “should have been allowed to stand in Joyce’s shoes and, in effect, exercise her right to self-representation.” Thus, plaintiff contends, Joyce was deprived of her right to represent herself pro se, in violation of her constitutional right to due process.

We acknowledge that litigants have the right to represent themselves pro se. Jacksonbay Builders, Inc. v. Azarmi, 869 A.2d 580, 585 (R.I. 2005). But pro se litigants “are not entitled to greater rights than those represented by counsel.” Id. (quoting Gray v. Stillman White Co., Inc., 522 A.2d 737, 741 (R.I. 1987)). Accordingly, pro se litigants have no right to be represented by an individual who is not authorized to practice law. 3', 'The plaintiff indicated at oral argument that he was not appealing the trial justice’s dismissal of the claims brought in his individual capacity.

California, 422 U.S. 806, 835 n.46 (1975)).', 'In this case, although Joyce had the right to represent herself pro se, she could not exercise that right through plaintiff, as her guardian (and son), because plaintiff is not authorized to practice law in Rhode Island, and his motion to appear on behalf of the Guardianship pro hac vice had been denied.5 Regardless, even if plaintiff had been authorized to practice law in Rhode Island, he could not represent the interests of Joyce as her counsel while also serving in his fiduciary capacity as her guardian, as a matter of law. See In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d 158, 167 (R.I. 2016) (explaining that a fiduciary relationship arises from the appointment of a guardian). Furthermore, plaintiff could not appear on behalf of the Guardianship, because he was a key fact witness in the case.

This case came before the Supreme Court on December 4, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 17, 2016, the state filed a criminal information against defendant alleging that, on April 3, 2016, she assaulted Emily Correa, her half-sister, with a knife. At trial, Correa testified that she and defendant had enjoyed a close relationship, would always “hang out,” and even lived together along with the father of Correa’s son, Garen Bartlett. However, Correa testified that her relationship with defendant soured after Bartlett kicked Correa out of the house and engaged in a relationship with defendant.', 'According to Correa, on April 3, 2016, she called Bartlett to get money for diapers and wipes for their son, and they agreed to meet. After she determined Bartlett’s location, Correa obtained a ride from Corina Walker, who was like a sister to Correa, to meet him. Correa testified that, when she and Walker arrived at the location, Bartlett pulled up behind them, driving defendant’s vehicle. Correa testified that she got out of Walker’s car, approached the driver’s side of defendant’s vehicle, and opened the door to ask Bartlett for the money. When she approached defendant’s vehicle, she noticed defendant sitting in the front passenger’s seat. Correa testified that she saw defendant reach toward the center console and retrieve a black case. She further testified that defendant then pulled the case open and threw it into her vehicle. Correa testified that she reached into the car to see what the object was; and that, by the time she turned around, defendant had exited the car, run around the back of it, and was standing approximately a foot away from Correa when she stabbed Correa in the chest. Correa testified that she held her chest and tried to run, but that defendant continued to swing the knife, and that defendant cut Correa’s left wrist as she was rushing at Correa. Correa testified that defendant', '-2- eventually stopped chasing her with the knife, but only after Walker helped Correa back into Walker’s car.', 'Although defendant did not testify at trial, her recorded interview with the police was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit. In her interview, defendant admitted that she stabbed Correa, but claimed that her action was in self-defense because Correa had rushed at her and wielded a knife of her own. According to defendant, Correa initially attacked Bartlett while he sat in the driver’s seat of her vehicle, then tried to reach over Bartlett to attack defendant. The defendant told police that she then got out of the vehicle, and Correa rushed at her. According to defendant, Correa saw defendant’s knife, but she attempted to stab defendant anyway; however, according to defendant she stabbed Correa first. The defendant further claimed that Correa hated her and had reason to attack her because Correa blamed defendant for “snitching on her,” which had led to the previous arrest of Correa and Bartlett for gun and drug charges.', 'Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine regarding Correa’s prior contacts with police and her criminal convictions. The state acknowledged that Correa had a conviction for possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act, but it sought to prevent the portion of defendant’s statement wherein she indicated to police that the drug for which Correa was convicted of possessing was heroin. The state also sought to preclude the jurors from learning that Correa had been arrested on gun-related charges. The state argued that any mention of guns was irrelevant because Correa did not plead to any gun charges, nor had she been convicted of any—only Bartlett had pled to those charges. The state further noted that Correa did not use a gun in this incident.', 'In opposition to the motion in limine, defendant argued that the gun charges against Correa were relevant to defendant’s claim of self-defense; specifically, regarding Correa’s', '-3- alleged bias toward defendant and defendant’s state of mind and motive for stabbing Correa. According to defendant, Correa believed that defendant had “snitched” and caused Correa and Bartlett to be charged with the gun crimes. However, the trial justice granted the state’s motion, finding significance in the fact that Bartlett “pled to the specific gun charges and [Correa] didn’t” and that “this [wa]s not a gun case[.]” The trial justice further found that the record of the drug conviction itself was admissible, but she noted that the defense could not “use the word heroin or the term heroin.”1 The trial justice also found that defendant would be permitted to question Correa at trial regarding “the issue of snitching[,]” motive, and bias toward defendant through her conviction for drug charges alone.', 'The state also filed a motion in limine to preclude defendant from introducing into evidence three videos that had been posted to Facebook that showed Correa engaged in prior acts of aggression. The state contended that the videos were inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because they were needless, cumulative, and inflammatory, and that any probative value to defendant was outweighed by unfair prejudice. The state claimed that Correa was expected to testify that she had carried a knife on prior occasions, that she had been arrested in December 2015 with a knife in her possession, had stabbed someone before, and that she had fought with others. Moreover, the state argued that, in accordance with this Court’s holding in State v. Tribble, 428 A.2d 1079 (R.I. 1981), defendant had to prove she was aware of each of these acts of aggression prior to the incident in question and that that would “turn into a minitrial within a trial, just to prove when each video was taken, [and] when the defendant learned of the acts depicted in each video[.]” Therefore, the state argued, the videos were not necessary to prove that Correa had engaged in violent behavior in the past, were cumulative in 1', 'On appeal, defendant does not take issue with this part of the trial justice’s ruling and only alleges error based on excluding any reference to Correa’s arrest on gun charges.', '-4- that Correa would testify to those acts, and that the only purpose the videos served was to inflame the passions of the jurors.', 'The defendant contended that the three videos were admissible because “[t]he video of these instances is what [defendant] saw. That is what created the fear in her.” The defendant further argued that the videos actually showed the level of Correa’s aggression and what she was capable of doing.', 'After viewing the three videos in chambers, the trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine because “such evidence would be cumulative” given that Correa would testify to the information contained in the videos and would not deny that she had stabbed people in the past. The trial justice found that the first video, from 2013, was remote in time from the April 2016 incident and was therefore not admissible. Additionally, the trial justice noted that the second and third videos were cumulative and would be offered solely to inflame the passions of the jurors. Finally, the trial justice determined that the videos would “cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was.” As such, none of the videos were admitted into evidence.', 'Following four days of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The trial justice denied the motion and sentenced defendant to five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, but suspended the sentence and placed her on probation for five years.', 'The defendant timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s', '-5- decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v. Perez, 161 A.3d 487, 493 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id. (quoting State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice “caused continual constitutional problems throughout [defendant]’s trial” by granting both motions in limine.', 'Specifically, defendant claims that she was prevented from demonstrating Correa’s proclivity to use physical violence when angered, which established, according to defendant, that it was reasonable for her to act “quickly, and forcefully” when Correa charged at her with a knife. We address each evidentiary argument in turn.', 'A', 'The Gun Charges', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by precluding evidence that Correa had been arrested on gun charges because, defendant argues, it prevented the jurors from fully understanding why defendant was afraid on the date in question, and the extent of Correa’s bias toward defendant. The defendant argues that this would have helped the jury to understand why defendant struck the “first physical blow” during the altercation and why that blow was in self-defense. In support of her contention, defendant asserts that gun charges are a more violent offense than drug charges with longer mandatory sentences and that, because Correa believed defendant had caused her to be arrested for the gun charges, Correa would be even more biased toward defendant.', '-6-', 'After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion. The trial justice provided more-than-adequate grounds to support her decision to grant the state’s motion in limine to prevent defendant from mentioning that Correa had been arrested on gun charges. Specifically, the trial justice noted that such charges were eventually dismissed as to Correa and that only Bartlett had pled to them. She further noted, importantly, that use of a gun was not in issue in the present case. Moreover, the trial justice determined that there were “sufficient ways to establish [the snitching] without * * * the gun piece.” Indeed, at trial, defendant established that Correa had been arrested in December 2015 with a knife on her person; Correa believed defendant was engaged in a relationship with Bartlett, the father of her child; and Correa blamed defendant for her arrest with Bartlett on the drug charges. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she prevented any mention that Correa had been arrested on the gun charges.', 'B', 'The Facebook Videos', 'Next, defendant maintains that the trial justice “looked at the evidence the wrong way round” when she determined that the Facebook videos illustrating Correa’s acts of violence were cumulative in light of Correa’s testimony regarding those acts. According to defendant, due to Correa’s “misleading and sanitized recollection of events[,]” the jurors were unable to appreciate the level of fear that defendant had of Correa. The defendant further claims that she could not adequately cross-examine and impeach Correa regarding her misleading statements about the fights depicted in the videos, which was essential to defendant’s self-defense claim. Again, we disagree.', '-7-', 'With regard to “the admissibility of specific-acts evidence, pursuant to Rule 404(b) [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence], our ruling in Tribble is controlling.” State v. Dellay, 687 A.2d 435, 439 (R.I. 1996). In Tribble, this Court held that a defendant claiming self-defense is “entitled to adduce relevant evidence of specific acts of violence perpetrated by the victim against third parties, provided however, that the defendant was aware of these acts at the time of his [or her] encounter with the victim.” Tribble, 428 A.2d at 1085. However, we noted that this rule is “not to be implemented without limitation[,]” as in cases where “such evidence might allow the principal issue to become lost in a maze of collateral matters[.]” Id. Accordingly, a defendant must show awareness of the specific “acts of violence and that the act or acts sought to be introduced are not too remote in time and are of such a quality as to be capable of contributing to the defendant’s fear of the victim.” Id. It is within the trial justice’s sound discretion “to limit the extent to which the incidents are sought to be proved.” Id. at 1086.', 'Additionally, Rule 403 provides that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of * * * needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', 'Turning to the case at bar, our careful review of the record leads us to conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion. The trial justice viewed all three videos and found that the first video, from 2013, was remote in time. Moreover, she found that the second and third videos would be cumulative because Correa was expected to testify to the specific acts depicted in them, and the videos were “highly inflammatory and would be offered solely to inflame the passions of the jurors.”', 'The trial justice further determined that the videos would “cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was[,]” pointing out that the ultimate issue was defendant’s perception of Correa, not the substance of the videos.', '-8-', 'At trial, both the state and defendant questioned Correa regarding the Facebook videos. Correa admitted during her testimony to stabbing twin sisters and telling defendant about it. She described that she had been in a fight while defendant was present and testified that defendant had joined in that fight. Correa admitted that she regularly carried a knife, especially when she was selling drugs. Correa testified that she did not have a knife in her hand on the date in question, but candidly acknowledged that, if she did, she would have used it and “stabbed [defendant] and Garen Bartlett.”', 'On cross-examination, defendant impeached Correa’s testimony, after Correa had claimed that she had abandoned her reputation as a fighter, by questioning her regarding a recent video of her fighting.', 'Moreover, the trial justice determined that the videos were cumulative, would inflame the passion of the jurors, and would “cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was.” This leads us to conclude that the trial justice’s findings with regard to the videos were significantly supported by the record and that her exclusion of them was in no manner an abuse of discretion.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion by granting either of the state’s motions in limine.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

15,Ana Tsonos : v. : Nicholas Tsonos. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Before the Court are former spouses who dispute the placement of their children, the visitation schedule, and whether the defendant should be subject to a mental health evaluation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Ana and Nicholas1 were married on August 3, 2003, and they had three children, Noah, Jeffrey, and Grayson, born in 2004, 2006, and 2010, respectively. Ana filed for divorce on February 3, 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. The parties entered into a marital settlement 1', 'We refer to the parties in this case by their first names for the sake of clarity because they share the same surname. We intend no disrespect by doing so. In addition, we refer to the minor children pseudonymously.', '2 agreement on August 16, 2011, and final judgment entered on February 14, 2012, which incorporated, but did not merge, the marital settlement agreement. The agreement provided, among other terms, that the parties share joint custody of their three minor children and assigned physical possession to Ana with visitation for Nicholas.2', 'In 2014, Ana filed a motion for ex parte relief seeking to suspend Nicholas’s overnight visitation after learning that Nicholas had left the children at his home without supervision. Her motion was granted, and, thereafter, the parties entered into a consent order that reinstated Nicholas’s visitation. Over the next few years, the parties filed a bevy of motions, of which the following are relevant to the matter now before the Court: Ana’s motion for Nicholas to submit to a psychological evaluation pursuant to Rule 35 of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure; Ana’s ex parte motion to suspend Nicholas’s unsupervised visitation; Ana’s motion for the children to discontinue counseling with Laura Ryan, a licensed independent clinical social worker (LICSW) whom the children had seen for therapy; and Nicholas’s motions to modify custody and visitation, which were first filed in August 2016.', 'Hearings on these motions took place over several days between April and December of 2017, during which the trial justice 3 heard testimony from Ana and Nicholas; their three children; Joseph Warzycha, an investigator for the Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA); and Laura Ryan. The testimony elicited at the hearings revealed the following events. Ana testified that Grayson, the youngest child, visited Nicholas in mid-December 2016, 2', 'Nicholas’s assigned visitation included three weeknights, overnight visits every other weekend from Saturday morning until Sunday night, and five consecutive days of vacation with the children each year. The agreement also contained specific provisions for holidays and birthdays. 3', 'These motions were heard initially by the general magistrate of the Family Court. In September 2017, however, he took the engagement of office as an associate justice of the Family Court. For sake of consistency, we refer to him as the trial justice throughout this opinion.', '3 and, after he returned to her home, he was “hysterical” because Nicholas had left King, a two-and- a-half-year-old German shepherd, outside in the cold.', 'According to Ana, Grayson was “inconsolable[,]” and “he was afraid that his dog was going to die.” Ana called the police to have them check on King because she “didn’t know what else to do[.]” A few days later, North Providence Animal Control contacted Warzycha to investigate the complaint of an animal having been “left outside during inclement weather without adequate shelter.”', 'Warzycha testified that he contacted Ana the same day and arranged a time to speak with the children that afternoon. According to Warzycha, the children reported that Nicholas had kicked and punched the dog on repeated occasions, left the dog outside in inclement weather without adequate shelter, and had not provided the dog with adequate food and water. Warzycha found that there was insufficient evidence to charge Nicholas with leaving an animal outside during inclement weather, but, after interviewing the children, he found probable cause that Nicholas had physically abused King. He also testified that King exhibited behavior consistent with physical abuse but admitted that he had had no prior interaction with King, so the behavior he observed could have been typical for King.', 'On December 22, 2016, the North Providence police and the SPCA contacted Nicholas and made arrangements to pick up King. Nicholas’s visitation with the children was suspended that same day due to the pending animal cruelty investigation. Nicholas was offered supervised visits at the courthouse while the investigation was pending, but he declined the offer.', 'On January 12, 2017, Nicholas filed a motion seeking to limit his own visitation with his children, stating that he did not have “the consistent capacity for conventional visitation opportunities” due to the logistics of defending against the allegation of animal abuse, meeting his child support obligations, and “maintaining his employment.” The court granted this motion by', '4 an order dated February 6, 2017. One month later, Nicholas moved to terminate the temporary suspension, which was granted, and the parties were ordered to resume the visitation schedule established in the marital settlement agreement. Warzycha testified that King was returned to Nicholas that same month.', 'Shortly thereafter, the children went to Noah’s hockey game with Nicholas. After a conversation with Noah the next day, Ana asked her father to go by Nicholas’s home and check on King. She then contacted animal control because her father had observed the dog outside in 4- degree weather in the snow. The dog was seized by animal control while Nicholas was at his office in Boston. Nicholas testified that he knew about his children’s concerns over his treatment of King at the time of this latter incident because he had read affidavits from Ana and the police reports from the December incident, even though the children had not addressed their concerns about the dog with him directly. After this second incident, Ana filed an ex parte motion to modify visitation and a motion for a mental health evaluation of Nicholas under Rule 35. The trial justice granted the ex parte motion and suspended Nicholas’s visitation effective immediately.', 'Ana testified that she was concerned for her children because they had witnessed abusive behavior toward a dog that they loved. Ana was worried that the children’s awareness of Nicholas’s behavior toward the dog was affecting them negatively, but she said she was comfortable with supervised visitation and wanted the children to see their father.', 'Nicholas’s testimony primarily focused on the correctness of his actions with regard to King. He testified at great length about King’s health, the adequacy of the outdoor doghouse, and about exactly how long King had been outside on the day of the hockey game. Nicholas further testified that the children never addressed any concerns about the dog to him, and he had no reason to believe the children did not want to talk to him about their concerns. He believed his child’s', '5 reaction to King was “irrational” and “f[ound] it amazing” that “the 12-year old [got] to decide * * * what adult decisions [Nicholas] make[s] to care for [his] pet.”', 'Nicholas also testified that his children’s concerns were influenced by Ana and the “poisonous” atmosphere of living with their mother and maternal grandparents. He questioned whether the children had in fact told Ana about King and suggested that the children had created false memories. Nicholas explained that if he had more access to his children, he could encourage more communication. He contended that the core of their family issues was not his care of King, but Ana being “hypervigilant” and her refusal to talk to him about her concerns.', 'As part of these hearings, the trial justice interviewed each of the three Tsonos children individually in his chambers on June 13, 2017. Noah, who was almost thirteen years old at the time, stated that he wanted the judge to help his father with his “anger” problem, that Nicholas was “not listening to people[,]” including his own father, and that he (Noah) was a “little bit kind of still scared” around Nicholas and his grandfather because of this. However, he did feel “fine” in court with Nicholas there because there were other people around. He indicated that his father would frequently get very angry and yell at him and his brothers and that his father used to hit them but had “gotten better with that.” He also testified that seeing his father at sports practices and games made him nervous because his father could potentially become angry. Despite this history, Noah indicated a desire to see his father, but “maybe not until he gets better”; Noah thought their previous visitation schedule worked well. Regarding King, he told the trial justice that he had seen his father hit and kick the dog and leave him outside. Noah stated that he did not want the dog to go back to his father’s house because he did not think that the dog was safe there.', 'Jeffrey, who was ten years old, stated that he missed his father and would like to visit with his father again, but that he did not like watching King get hurt at Nicholas’s house. He said that', '6 if he were upset, angry, or uncomfortable, he would have no problem telling his father. Grayson, who was in kindergarten at the time, did not wish to speak to the trial justice regarding his father.', 'After reading transcripts of what the children had said to the trial justice while in his chambers, Nicholas testified further. Nicholas blamed “immature children and a hypervigilant [mother for] creat[ing] a loss of eight months of [their] lives.” Nicholas indicated that he was willing to adjust his behavior only to the extent that it would help Noah “perceive things as they are.” He also testified that Noah was dishonest with the trial justice during their conversation in chambers. Finally, Nicholas contended that Noah needed therapy because he thought his judgment was better than his father’s and to understand that “[he is] the child and he has parents.”', 'Laura Ryan, the social worker who had worked with the family, also testified and submitted a report. She began counseling the family in the fall of 2014 and had her last session with them in February 2017, prior to the second incident with King and three months before she wrote a report for the court. She testified that the longer children are separated from their parents or exposed to negative information, they “tend to lean towards the negative regarding the parent they’re not seeing.” In her report, Ryan recommended “50/50 shared placement * * * or at the least a generous visitation schedule” for Nicholas. Ryan testified that Nicholas and the children needed to talk about the King situation “in a therapeutic setting or otherwise” for them “to get back in a good place.” In her opinion, the children were “deteriorat[ing] in their emotions” because of the “roller coaster ride” of their schedules being changed and the constant family crisis.', 'Ryan testified further that the children had discussed their concerns about King with her. Noah told her that if he saw his father mistreating King, he would not say anything because his father would not listen to him. Importantly, Ryan testified that a child’s concern over an animal', '7 being outside might be irrational if, for example, it was 65 degrees, but that did not mean the child’s concern should not be addressed, whether it was “scientifically valid or not[.]”', 'The trial justice entered an order on March 22, 2018, denying Nicholas’s motions to modify visitation and placement; granting, in part, Ana’s motion for a Rule 35 mental health examination of Nicholas; and ordering the parties to engage Dr. Marnee Colburn for the purposes of said evaluation as well as for a “parent-child evaluation of [Nicholas] and the minor children.” The order contains the following findings:', '“1. The [c]ourt heard testimony in this matter from witnesses', 'including [p]laintiff, [d]efendant, RISPCA Officer Joseph', 'Warzycha, Laura Ryan, LICSW and the minor children.', '“2. The [c]ourt finds that [p]laintiff’s sole concern in this matter is', 'the well-being of her children.', '“3. The [c]ourt finds that [d]efendant has engaged in a course of', 'conduct which demonstrates an indifference to his children’s', 'concerns;', '“4. That [d]efendant has demonstrated a lack of empathy regarding', 'the impact that his actions toward the family dog have had on his', 'children;', '“5. That [d]efendant is ‘thumbing his nose’ at the concerns of his', 'children and the [p]laintiff.', '“6. The [c]ourt further finds that [d]efendant needs to work on', 'understanding how his actions and statements have an impact on his', 'children and how to interact with them in a way that is not adverse.”', 'It is this order from which Nicholas appeals. 4 4', 'The order also found Ana’s motion to suspend counseling with Ryan moot because the parties were no longer seeing her. Nicholas does not challenge this aspect of the order.', '8', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court “will not disturb findings of fact made by a trial justice or magistrate in a divorce action unless he or she has misconceived the relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Vieira v. Hussein-Vieira, 150 A.3d 611, 615 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Palin v. Palin, 41 A.3d 248, 253 (R.I. 2012)). “Consequently, unless it is shown that the trial justice either improperly exercised his or her discretion or that there was an abuse thereof, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings.” Id. at 615 (quoting Palin, 41 A.3d at 253). “Questions of law in an appeal from the Family Court, however, are reviewed de novo.” Id. at 615-16 (quoting Palin, 41 A.3d at 253).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Nicholas, representing himself pro se, argues before us that the trial justice abused his discretion when he issued the March 22, 2018 order because the justice’s findings were not adequately supported by the record, were not tied to empirical evidence, were contradicted by the record, or were ambiguous. Nicholas contends that the children had not been adversely affected by his behavior and that no evidence of an adverse effect was presented during the hearings. He further argues that the trial justice did not support his order to submit to a psychological evaluation with any findings.', 'Finally, Nicholas contends that the trial justice did not address Ryan’s recommendation with respect to shared placement of the children.', '9', 'Ana counters that this appeal is meritless and is “merely a further effort to harass, intimidate and financially abuse” her. She also asserts that Nicholas’s prebriefing statement does not present any legal issues for this Court to review and that he is merely attempting to reargue his case.5', 'After thorough review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice was not clearly wrong because there is substantial evidence in the record to support his findings. First, the trial justice found that Ana’s sole concern was the well-being of her children. Ana testified that she was concerned for her children, who witnessed abusive behavior and a dog that they love being treated “inhumanely.” Ana further testified that she does not wish to isolate the children from their father, and she continues to support supervised visitation, as she has through years of litigation. Importantly, Ana’s ex parte motion only asked to suspend unsupervised visitation, not all visitation.', 'Second, the trial justice made multiple findings regarding Nicholas’s apathy towards his children’s concerns and found that Nicholas needed to work on understanding how his actions and statements impact the children and learn to interact with them in a way that is not adverse. These findings are also well supported by the record. Even after becoming aware of his children’s concerns over leaving King outside, Nicholas admitted that he had not changed the way he cared for King. As the trial justice stated in his bench decision, the point is not whether Nicholas is treating the dog lawfully or unlawfully, it is how the children perceive his treatment of King that is at issue. 5', 'Nicholas also submitted a supplemental memorandum that addresses both this appeal and his appeal from the grant of Ana’s Motion to Relocate (No. 2018-304-A). In that memorandum, he reiterates many of his prior arguments and asks the Court to overturn the orders in both appeals, require de novo review in Family Court with the “direct intent to reunite” him with his children, order that a clinical or therapeutic resource be engaged to address the children’s needs caused by their estrangement from him, and require that a new Family Court justice be assigned to this case.', '10', 'The order for Nicholas’s mental health evaluation and continued suspension of his visitation is likewise well supported by the record. Thus, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by denying Nicholas’s motion to modify visitation and placement and ordering Nicholas’s visitation to remain suspended and that Nicholas submit to a mental health evaluation pursuant to Rule 35. Rule 35(a) provides, in relevant part, that:', '“In an action in which the mental or physical condition * * * of a', 'party * * * is in controversy, the court may order the party to submit', 'to a physical or mental or blood examination by a physician * * *.', 'The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and', 'upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall', 'specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the', 'examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.” A decision to order such an examination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice. See In re Christina V., 749 A.2d 1105, 1112 (R.I. 2000); Dom. Rel. Proc.

Instead of seeking to understand the children’s concerns, he invalidated them repeatedly by questioning whether the children actually told Ana about their concerns and hypothesizing that the children had “false memories.” As the trial justice pointed out, these explanations were nonsensical because, when Ana asked her father to check on King, the dog was in fact outside in subfreezing temperature.

16,Corrine A. Lang as Executrix of the Estate : of Kevin Lang v. : Municipal Employees’ Retirement System : of Rhode Island.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. This Court issued a writ of certiorari to review a decision by the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC) upholding the award of accidental disability benefits for occupational cancer to the petitioner, Kevin Lang (Lang or petitioner).1 The Appellate Division affirmed the trial judge’s ruling that the WCC had subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the petitioner’s claim and that G.L. 1956 § 45-19.1-1 created a conclusive presumption that cancer in firefighters arises out of and in the course of their employment as firefighters. The Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (respondent) seeks reversal of the final decree entered by the WCC, contending that the WCC did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the petitioner’s claim and that chapter 19.1 of title 45 of the general laws does not contain such a conclusive presumption. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and quash in part the final decree of the WCC. 1', 'The record reflects that Kevin Lang passed away in June 2017. On December 3, 2018, this Court ordered that Corrine A. Lang, as Executrix of the Estate of Kevin Lang, be substituted as petitioner.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. Lang served as a firefighter for the City of Cranston from 1996 until September 2012, when his career was abruptly cut short after he was diagnosed with colon cancer. The city placed Lang on injured-on-duty status, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 45-19-1, and he began receiving salary benefits while incapacitated from work. In January 2014, he applied for accidental disability benefits under G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-9, based upon his cancer diagnosis. In July 2015, the Retirement Board of the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (the board) found that he did not prove that his cancer arose out of and in the course of his employment as a firefighter, and it therefore denied his application. The board notified him of his right to appeal its decision to the Superior Court; however, he appealed the decision to the WCC. He alleged that § 45-21.2-9(f) provided the WCC with subject-matter jurisdiction to hear his appeal.', 'The respondent filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in the WCC for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that petitioner’s appeal belonged in the Superior Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15 of the Administrative Procedures Act. The trial judge denied respondent’s motion to dismiss and certified a question of law to this Court regarding the interpretation of §§ 45-21.2-9 and 45-19.1-1. After careful consideration, this Court declined to answer the question. The petitioner then filed a motion for summary judgment in the WCC, arguing that, pursuant to chapter 19.1 of title 45, all cancers contracted by firefighters are presumed to be work-related. The trial judge agreed with petitioner but found that factual issues remained.', '-2-', 'The petitioner submitted three affidavits: one from Lang; one from Raymond Chaquette, M.D., Lang’s oncologist; and one from William McKenna, the chief of the Cranston Fire Department. The affidavits established that Lang had been employed as a firefighter since 1996, was diagnosed with colon cancer in September 2012, and was immediately placed on injured-on-duty status because he was unable to work as a firefighter. Lang also submitted the record of proceedings before the board, along with its decision. Included in the record of proceedings were the reports from five physicians, including Dr. Chaquette. Although all five physicians agreed that Lang was permanently disabled, none could state that Lang’s colon cancer resulted from exposures that occurred while he was employed as a firefighter.', 'The trial judge issued a written decision in which she reversed the board, finding that § 45-19.1-1(b) creates a conclusive presumption that all cancer in firefighters under § 45-19.1-1(a) arises out of and in the course of their employment; she therefore granted Lang accidental disability retirement benefits based upon his claim of occupational cancer. The respondent appealed to the Appellate Division, which, in a written decision, denied and dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision and decree of the trial judge. A final decree was entered that affirmed the findings of fact and orders contained in the decree entered by the trial judge. The respondent filed a timely petition for writ of certiorari, which this Court granted.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” Plante v.

Generally, § 45-19-1 grants salary benefits to firefighters who have been injured on duty. In 2011, the General', '-4- Assembly amended § 45-19-1 to add subsection (j), which provides that any person receiving such benefits shall apply for an accidental disability retirement allowance within eighteen months of their injury, or they risk losing their injured-on-duty benefits. Subsection (2) of § 45-19-1(j) provides that a person who has applied to receive an accidental disability retirement allowance will continue to receive injured-on-duty payments, but the right to those payments “shall terminate in the event of a final ruling of the workers compensation court allowing accidental disability benefits.” (Emphasis added.) Pertinent to this case, § 45-21.2-9, entitled “Retirement for accidental disability,” provides accidental disability retirement allowance benefits to firefighters who are rendered physically or mentally incapacitated as a result of injury while in the line of duty. Also in 2011, the General Assembly amended § 45-21.2-9 to add, inter alia, subsection (f), which provides that “[i]n the event that any party is aggrieved by the determination of the retirement board pursuant to § 45-19-1, for an injury or illness occurring on or after July 1, 2011, the party may submit an appeal to the Rhode Island workers’ compensation court.”2 (Emphasis added.)

According to respondent, the plain and unambiguous language in § 45-21.2-9 vests the WCC with authority to hear appeals from the board only when the board has rendered a determination pursuant to § 45-19-1.', 'The respondent avers that § 45-21.2-9(f) should be read in isolation, and parses out the language in that section to conclude that the unambiguous language provides that an aggrieved party can appeal to the WCC only when the board has rendered its decision “pursuant to § 45-19-1[.]”', 'The respondent claims that, because the board rendered the decision on petitioner’s claim pursuant to § 45-21.2-9, the WCC lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner’s appeal.', 'This Court has noted, however, that “the plain meaning approach must not be confused with ‘myopic literalism’; even when confronted with a clear and unambiguous statutory provision, it is entirely proper for us to look to the sense and meaning fairly deducible from the context.” O’Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 426 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Raiche v. Scott, 101 A.3d 1244, 1248 (R.I. 2014)).

Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 681 (R.I. 1999)).', 'To adopt respondent’s approach would render § 45-21.2-9(f) a nullity and would lead to an absurd result: The board, as respondent points out, would not have the ability to render decisions pursuant to § 45-19-1.', 'The respondent’s interpretation would mean the General Assembly created an appeal to the WCC that would have no effect and would give the WCC no new jurisdiction whatsoever, because the board will never render a decision pursuant to § 45-19-1. While we recognize that a strict reading of § 45-19-1 may suggest that the WCC lacks jurisdiction, we decline to interpret it as such, because it would “lead to a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly[.]” O’Connell, 156 A.3d at 428 (brackets omitted).', 'Sections 45-19-1 and 45-21.2-9(f), when read in conjunction, demonstrate the General Assembly’s intent to cloak the WCC with jurisdiction over appeals by aggrieved parties who have applied for an accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to the time mandate contained in § 45-19-1(j) and were denied by the board. A reading of § 45-19-1(j) reveals that the statute clearly directs a person collecting injured-on-duty benefits to “apply for an accidental disability retirement allowance from the state retirement board” as a claim under § 45-21.2-9. Once the claim has been heard and the board has rendered a decision, an aggrieved applicant can then appeal to the WCC pursuant to § 45-21.2-9(f). Section 45-19-1(j)(2) further illustrates the General Assembly’s intent that the WCC have jurisdiction over such appeals. That section provides that the applicant will continue to receive injured-on-duty benefits, but such benefits', '-7- “shall terminate in the event of a final ruling of the workers compensation court allowing accidental disability benefits.” Section 45-19-1(j)(2) (emphasis added).', 'We find further support for this statutory interpretation in G.L. 1956 § 28-30-1(a) of the Workers’ Compensation Act (the act), which grants the WCC “jurisdiction that may be necessary to carry out its duties under * * * the provisions of the Rhode Island general law § 45-21.2-9[.]” For the General Assembly to grant the WCC the jurisdiction necessary to carry out its duties under § 45-21.2-9, and for this Court to interpret § 45-21.2-9(f) as providing the WCC with no new jurisdiction under that section, would disregard all sense of legislative intent and would defeat the underlying purpose of the act. See O’Connell, 156 A.3d at 426. Therefore, we conclude that the General Assembly intended the WCC to have jurisdiction over appeals from adverse decisions rendered by the retirement board when the application was filed pursuant to the time mandate contained in § 45-19-1(j).', '2', 'Second, respondent contends that the WCC lacked jurisdiction over petitioner’s appeal because, respondent argues, occupational cancer and injury are two separate reasons for obtaining an accidental disability retirement allowance, and occupational cancer is not an injury within the meaning of § 45-21.2-9. Specifically, respondent argues that § 45-21.2-9(a) provides for accidental disability retirement allowance on the basis of injury or illness, while § 45-21.2-9(e) provides for accidental disability retirement allowance for occupational cancer. The respondent reasons that, if the General Assembly intended to include occupational cancer in § 45-21.2-9(f), it would have expressly done so. We disagree.', 'Again, we decline to read the provisions of the statute in such a rigid and technical manner, but instead make every effort to harmonize them. See O’Connell, 156 A.3d at 428.', '-8- First, as respondent correctly points out, under § 45-21.2-9(a), an applicant is entitled to an accidental disability allowance for an injury or illness sustained while in the line of duty; however, § 45-21.2-9(e) provides for an accidental disability retirement allowance based upon occupational cancer while in service or after retirement. Section 45-21.2-9(e) also provides that an applicant is entitled to “all of the benefits provided for in this chapter[.]” (Emphasis added.)', 'Further supporting our interpretation is the fact that the act, at G.L. 1956 § 28-35-11, entitled “Questions determined by court,” provides that “[a]ll questions arising under * * * Rhode Island general law § 45-21.2-9 shall, except as otherwise provided, be determined by the workers’ compensation court[.]” (Emphasis added.) Clearly, the General Assembly intended to provide the WCC with jurisdiction over all appeals arising under § 45-21.2-9, unless the General Assembly explicitly provided otherwise. Section 45-21.2-9(f) contains no language explicitly indicating that appeals based on occupational cancer are to be treated differently. The General Assembly had the opportunity to include such language so as to specifically provide that accidental disability retirement applications based on occupational cancer could not be appealed to the WCC; indeed, § 45-21.2-9(e) was enacted in 1991,3 while § 45-21.2-9(f) was enacted twenty years later, in 2011.4 However, it chose not to do so. See Horn v. Southern Union Co., 927 A.2d 292, 296 (R.I. 2007) (“[I]t is presumed that the General Assembly, when enacting a statute, is aware of earlier legislation.”).', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the General Assembly intended to include occupational cancer as an injury in the WCC appeal provision provided for in § 45-21.2-9(f). 3', 'P.L. 1991, ch. 255, § 1. 4', 'P.L. 2011, ch. 151, art. 12, § 8.', '-9-', '3', 'Third, respondent argues that the WCC erred when it identified cancer as an occupational disease under the act and concluded that the date of diagnosis of the cancer is the date of injury for the purpose of determining the ability of a cancer applicant to appeal to the WCC. The respondent contends that § 45-21.2-9(j) only grants the WCC with authority to use its case-management procedures and dispute-resolution processes, but not its substantive law, in determining an appeal under that section. Once again, however, we decline to read the statute in such a rigid and hyper-technical manner, but we shall instead attempt to glean the General Assembly’s intent. See In re B.H., 194 A.3d at 264; O’Connell, 156 A.3d at 428.', 'Section 45-21.2-9(j) requires that “[a]ll proceedings filed with the workers’ compensation court pursuant to this section shall be de novo and shall be subject to the provisions of chapters 29–38 of title 28 for all case management procedures and dispute resolution processes, as provided under the rules of workers’ compensation court.” The language of § 45-21.2-9(j) clearly states that all proceedings are subject to chapters 29–38 of title 28, and the statute contains no limiting language. Had the General Assembly intended to limit the authority of the WCC to procedural issues only, it could have provided in that statute that proceedings filed in the WCC pursuant to § 45-21.2-9(j) were subject only to the provisions of chapter 35 of title 28, which specifically deals with court procedures; however, the General Assembly did not do so. We conclude that the General Assembly intended that appeals filed with the WCC pursuant to § 45-21.2-9(j) are subject to all of the provisions in chapters 29 through 38 of title 28, and are not limited to case-management procedures only. This leads to the firm conclusion that the WCC properly ensured its jurisdiction by looking to the act, specifically G.L. 1956 § 28-34-2(33) to', '- 10 - determine that occupational cancer is a compensable injury, and § 28-34-6 to determine the date of disability.5', 'B', 'Conclusive Presumption', 'The respondent also contends that the WCC erred when it determined that § 45-19.1-1 creates a conclusive presumption that any diagnosis of cancer among firefighters is an “occupational cancer” entitling them to an accidental disability retirement allowance, without the need to prove that the cancer resulted from employment as a firefighter. The respondent claims that the statute does not expressly contain a conclusive or rebuttable presumption and that the General Assembly has not intended such a presumption because (1) the General Assembly has expressly created conclusive presumptions in other statutes; (2) the statutory definition of “occupational cancer” would be rendered meaningless; and (3) the General Assembly has created presumptions for health impairment of firefighters due to smoke inhalation and delegated that duty to municipalities. Finally, respondent asserts that any reliance on this Court’s holding in City of East Providence v. International Association of Firefighters Local 850, 982 A.2d 1281 (R.I. 2009) (IAF Local 850), is misplaced.', 'At the outset, we note that both the trial judge and the Appellate Division of the WCC relied on this Court’s holding in IAF Local 850 in determining that § 45-19.1-1 creates a conclusive presumption that any cancer in firefighters is occupational cancer; however, such reliance is misplaced. Although we did refer to chapter 19.1 of title 45 in IAF Local 850, we did 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-34-2 provides: “The disablement of any employee resulting from an occupational disease or condition described in the following schedule shall be treated as the happening of a personal injury[:] * * * (33) Disability arising from any cause connected with or arising from the peculiar characteristics of the employment.” Section 28-34-6 provides: “For the purpose of this chapter the date of disablement for an occupational disease shall be the date of partial or total incapacity to work as a result of the disease.”', '- 11 - not do so directly, as that case came before us on review of an arbitrator’s decision. IAF Local 850, 982 A.2d at 1283. As we stated in IAF Local 850, our review of an arbitrator’s decision is “limited in nature[,]” and highly deferential to the arbitrator’s findings and legal reasoning. Id. at 1285. The arbitrator is tasked with interpreting relevant state law and the “arbitrator’s award will be upheld even if he or she makes a mistake or error in interpreting the law.” Id. As such, we addressed chapter 19.1, but only with regard to whether the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law, which “occurs when an arbitrator understands and correctly articulates the law, but then proceeds to disregard it.” Id. at 1286.', 'In IAF Local 850, the arbitrator determined that the parties had intended to incorporate § 45-19-1 into their collective-bargaining agreement and that chapter 19.1 of title 45 amended § 45-19-1 to include cancer as an occupational injury for Rhode Island firefighters. IAF Local 850, 982 A.2d at 1284. Based on this interpretation, the arbitrator concluded that the city was obligated to provide injured-on-duty benefits to a firefighter who had been diagnosed with cancer. Id. On appeal, the city contended that the language in chapter 19.1 limited its application to municipalities that participated in the optional retirement plan for police officers and firefighters and that, because the city did not participate in that plan, it was not subject to chapter 19.1. Id. at 1285. Looking at chapter 19.1 through that lens, we stated that the General Assembly clearly intended to ensure that cancer was a basis upon which one could receive injured-on-duty benefits and that the statutory language did not limit application of that benefit to municipalities. Id. at 1288. We held that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in finding that the city was obligated to provide injured-on-duty benefits to a firefighter diagnosed with cancer, based on his interpretation of chapter 19.1. Id. at 1289.', '- 12 -', 'Our task in IAF Local 850 was not to provide our interpretation of chapter 19.1 of title 45, but rather to determine whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority by rendering an irrational decision; therefore, our holding did not determine what type of cancer a firefighter must prove to obtain occupational cancer disability benefits or that all cancers are occupational cancers. IAF Local 850, 982 A.2d at 1285.', 'Rather, that case involved a straightforward application of the limited review of an arbitrator’s decision, holding that the arbitrator had applied the law as he interpreted it. Id. at 1286, 1289. In the present case, however, we address the interpretation of chapter 19.1 on de novo review.', 'Turning to the statute in question, chapter 19.1 of title 45 is composed of three sections.

The General Assembly defines “occupational cancer” in § 45-19.1-2(d) and provides in § 45-19.1-3 that a firefighter must be “unable to perform his or her duties” because of that occupational cancer before being entitled receive an occupational cancer disability benefit.

The legislative findings in § 45-19.1-1(a) are general statements regarding the harsh conditions that firefighters can face or often face. Specifically, § 45-19.1-1(a)(4) states that firefighters “are often exposed” to carcinogens and that the rise in occupational cancer “can be related” to toxic substances being in the environment, while § 45-19.1-1(a)(5) adds that cancer among firefighters “can develop very slowly[.]” (Emphasis added.) This is followed by the further declaration in § 45-19.1-1(b) of the General Assembly’s findings that those “conditions exist and arise out of or in the course of that employment.” Significantly, however, § 45-19.1-1(b) does not declare that each and every individual firefighter has necessarily faced those harsh conditions and been harmed by them, or that every cancer in a firefighter is “a cancer arising out of his or her employment as a fire', '- 15 - fighter, due to injury from exposures * * * while in the performance of active duty in the fire department.” Section 45-19.1-2(d) (emphasis added).', 'We believe that the general findings contained in § 45-19.1-1 are akin to broad-brush policy observations that provide the backdrop for the remedy that § 45-19.1-3 offers when a firefighter can prove that he or she specifically has suffered from the general conditions listed in § 45-19.1-1 and has been diagnosed with occupational cancer, as defined in § 45-19.1-2(d), as a result. While such policy language can be helpful to clarify other substantive provisions, it is “prefatory in nature and does not create any substantive private right.” Heritage Healthcare Services, Inc. v. Marques, 14 A.3d 932, 938 (R.I. 2011); see Grasso Service Center, Inc. v. Sepe, 962 A.2d 1283, 1288-89 (R.I. 2009) (“Although ‘preambles may be used to clarify ambiguities, they do not create rights that are not found within the statute.’”) (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 110 at 320 (2001)).', 'To conclude that the language in § 45-19.1-1 creates a conclusive presumption would not only render the statutory definition of occupational cancer in § 45-19.1-2(d) meaningless and create a right not found within the statute, but would also construe the statute to reach an absurd result. For example, a conclusive presumption that all cancers in firefighters are occupational cancers would mean that a firefighter who smoked four packs of cigarettes a day for decades would receive an occupational cancer disability benefit despite not having proved that his cancer was related to exposure on the job.', 'Similarly, a conclusive presumption would provide occupational cancer benefits to a firefighter who contracted cancer as a result of exposure to pesticides while landscaping in his or her yard. We do not believe the General Assembly would have extended such broad benefits to all firefighters without expressly providing for such in clear and unambiguous language.', '- 16 -', 'An example of such express, clear language is found in § 45-19-16, which provides that municipalities have the option to enact a rebuttable presumption by ordinance that all conditions of health impairment caused by smoke inhalation of the lungs or respiratory tract suffered by firefighters are suffered in the line of duty, unless competent evidence is shown to the contrary. Given that the General Assembly expressly provided for a rebuttable presumption in such similar circumstances in that statute, we do not believe that the General Assembly would have neglected to include such express language in chapter 19.1 of title 45, especially if the General Assembly indeed intended to create such a conclusive presumption.', 'Accordingly, we hold that chapter 19.1 of title 45 does not contain a conclusive, or for that matter any, presumption that all cancers in firefighters are occupational cancers. Therefore, that portion of the decree on review that concludes as much is quashed.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, the decree on review is affirmed in regard to the finding that the WCC had jurisdiction to hear the petitioner’s appeal, but is quashed in regard to the finding that chapter 19.1 of title 45 contains a conclusive presumption that all cancer in firefighters is occupational cancer. The papers in this case may be returned to the Workers’ Compensation Court with our decision endorsed thereon.', 'Justice Flaherty, concurring in part and dissenting in part.', 'I am in complete agreement with my colleagues that the Workers’ Compensation Court is vested with jurisdiction to hear this appeal from the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System.', 'I therefore unequivocally join in that part of the majority’s opinion. I must, however, most respectfully', '- 17 - depart from the majority’s opinion that the statutory framework does not provide that a diagnosis of cancer entitles a firefighter to an accidental disability pension.', 'This case is about a firefighter, Kevin Lang, who served the City of Cranston for an excess of twenty years, succumbed to colon cancer in 2017, and, despite the General Assembly’s explicit and unreserved legislative findings that a firefighter’s cancer arises as the result of his service to his municipality, is today denied the full benefits that the Legislature provided for firefighters who are diagnosed with cancer.1 I dissent because the General Assembly determined as a matter of declarative fact that cancer in firefighters is caused by their dangerous working conditions and because I cannot fathom how the statute at issue can be read in any other way.', 'Central to the parties’ dispute is chapter 19.1 of title 45 of our general laws, entitled Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters, and how it interacts with G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-9, relating to accidental disability pensions. Under the provisions of § 45-21.2-9, a firefighter may seek “an accidental disability retirement allowance” when the firefighter is the victim of an “occupational cancer[.]” Section 45-21.2-9(e). As § 45-21.2-9(c) dictates, an occupational cancer is “a cancer arising out of employment as a fire fighter[.]” Id. At issue is: What evidence was Mr. Lang required to produce to demonstrate that he was the victim of an occupational cancer and that that malady arose as a result of his employment? The majority today essentially holds that Mr. Lang must bring forth expert testimony to definitively prove that his work as a firefighter led to his cancer diagnosis. I disagree because it is my opinion that the General Assembly already has provided that link in § 45-19.1-1(a) of the Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters statute. 1', 'The majority says that Mr. Lang served from 1996 until 2012. However, it was in 2012 when Mr. Lang was put on injured-on-duty status. Mr. Lang remained a member in active service until his death. I thus characterize his time of service as exceeding twenty years.', '- 18 -', 'In my opinion, § 45-19.1-1 is clear and unambiguous. That enactment enumerates certain legislative findings, including that firefighters are exposed to “smoke, fumes, or carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances[.]” Section 45-19.1-1(a)(1).', 'Indeed, the General Assembly declared that firefighters “are often exposed simultaneously to multiple carcinogens” and that there had been a rise in cancer diagnoses among firefighters because of the proliferation of toxic substances in the environment. Section 45-19.1-1(a)(4). Finally, the General Assembly declared that the effects of that exposure may take decades to develop, articulating that “[t]he onset of cancers in fire fighters can develop very slowly, usually manifesting themselves from five (5) years to forty (40) years after exposure to the cancer-causing agent.” Section 45-19.1- 1(a)(5).', 'Most importantly, to follow those very strong and unequivocal findings, the Legislature then said in subsection (b) of the very same statute: “The [G]eneral [A]ssembly further finds and declares that all of the previously stated conditions exist and arise out of or in the course of that employment.” Section 45-19.1-1(b). Because “cancer” is a “previously stated condition,” a clearer and more direct statement confirming the link of firefighting and cancer could not be made.', 'Much of the argument in this case has centered on whether the law established a “conclusive presumption” that cancer in firefighters arises out of their employment. In my view, those arguments are wide of the mark. As described above, the language employed by the General Assembly exceeds presumption.', 'Rather, that language establishes the connection between a cancer diagnosis and employment as a firefighter by declarative fact. Consequently, all Mr. Lang should have been required to prove to receive an accidental disability retirement is that he developed cancer and that he was a firefighter. There is no further need to establish the', '- 19 - connection between the cancer and his lifesaving work because the General Assembly, cognizant of the difficulties of establishing a link between the ever-present conditions that produce a disease that may take decades to become symptomatic, already did it for him. This is sensible because, as the General Assembly said, “cancers in fire fighters can develop very slowly” and may manifest only after forty years from exposure “to the cancer-causing agent.” Section 45- 19.1-1(a)(5) (emphasis added). Further, a cancer-stricken firefighter would find it difficult, if not impossible, to recollect which of many fires or other on-the-job responses resulted in his exposure to a particular toxin. It is obvious that a doctor would be hard-pressed to link any individual’s cancer to any specific event that may have occurred twenty years ago, especially considering all of the other exposures to carcinogens in a firefighter’s everyday life. It is clear to me that the General Assembly, therefore, in recognition in § 45-19.1-1(a)(3) that “[f]ire fighters are constantly entering uncontrolled environments to save lives and reduce property damage[,]” enumerated in § 45-19.1-1(b) that cancer in those employed as firefighters “exist[s] and arise[s] out of or in the course of that employment.”', 'What’s more, although the majority does not articulate whether the statute is ambiguous or not, it nonetheless, in a lengthy analysis, characterized chapter 19.1 of title 45 as “not the epitome of legislative clarity.” It then proceeds to construe the statute in an effort to discern legislative intent. However, it is axiomatic that this Court applies the rules of construction only to statutes that it deems to be ambiguous. As such, I can only conclude that the majority considers the statute to in fact be ambiguous. Indeed, it goes without saying that, if the majority had determined the law to be unambiguous, which is the conclusion that I have reached, it would simply have applied it as written, unless such an application would lead to an absurd result.', '- 20 -', 'Even if I were to agree with the majority that the statute is ambiguous, and I do not, the result should be to affirm the Workers’ Compensation Court. This is so because, without question, the statute is remedial in nature in that it creates new rights for firefighters who have been stricken with cancer and provides a remedy for them. See Gem Plumbing & Heating Co., Inc. v. Rossi, 867 A.2d 796, 811 (R.I. 2005) (explaining that a remedial statute is a statute “which affords a remedy, or improves or facilitates remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights or redress of wrongs”) (quoting Ayers-Schaffner v. Solomon, 461 A.2d 396, 399 (R.I. 1983)). It seems to me that it is beyond argument that providing an accidental disability pension and any other relevant benefits to firefighters who develop cancer is the goal of the statute. Nonetheless, the majority has construed the statute narrowly, and not liberally, as our law consistently has required. See Gem Plumbing & Heating, 867 A.2d at 811 (“[W]here the statute is remedial * * * it is to be construed liberally.” (quoting Ayers-Schaffner, 461 A.2d at 399)); see also State v. Carter, 827 A.2d 636, 643 (R.I. 2003) (“[T]o effectuate its salutary purpose a remedial statute should be liberally construed[.]” (quoting State v. Simmons, 114 R.I. 16, 18, 327 A.2d 843, 845 (1974))). It is also noteworthy that, in its construction of chapter 19.1 of title 45 and § 45-21.2-9, the majority has drawn a contrast between chapter 19.1 of title 45 and G.L. 1956 § 45-19-16, which provides as follows:', '“Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law or to', 'any state or municipal retirement system, any city or town may, by', 'ordinance, provide that every condition of impairment of health', 'caused by smoke inhalation of the lungs or respiratory tract,', 'resulting in total disability or death to a uniformed member of a', 'paid fire department, is presumed to have been suffered in the line', 'of duty as a result of the inhalation of noxious fumes or poisonous', 'gases, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence;', 'provided, that the person benefiting by the presumption passes a', 'physical examination upon entry into service or subsequent to', 'entry an examination failed to reveal any evidence of the', 'condition.”', '- 21 -', 'The majority seizes upon this statute as grist for its conclusion that the General Assembly is well aware of how to call for a conclusive presumption when it wishes to do so—and because it did not do that in chapter 19.1 of title 45, no such presumption exists. However, with all due respect, it is my opinion that a reliance on § 45-19-16 is flawed in a number of respects.', 'For one, § 45-19-16 is permissive in nature; it allows, but does not require, municipalities to enact an ordinance providing that an impairment of health due to lung damage is presumed to have been caused by employment as a firefighter. Moreover, and of far more importance, § 45-19-16 was enacted in 1963, at a time when there was a comparative dearth of scientific knowledge about the increase in danger from toxins and carcinogens in the environment.2 By the time the General Assembly passed § 45-19.1-1 into law in 1987, scientific knowledge had expanded exponentially. For this reason, the General Assembly made legislative findings about the dangers of toxic and carcinogenic substances, particularly to firefighters, who are thrust into the middle of conflagrations saturated by cancer causing chemicals each and every day, and there were veritable mountains of information available that conclusively linked carcinogens and other toxins in the environment to lethal health conditions, especially in the case of firefighters.', 'Lastly, it is my opinion that, despite its valiant efforts to distance itself from the crystal- clear language employed by this Court in City of East Providence v. International Association of Firefighters Local 850, 982 A.2d 1281 (R.I. 2009), the majority falls far short of its goal to escape the grasp of the rationale of that case. Although it is true that that case involved an appeal 2', 'By way of example, Congress did not require language warning that smoking cigarettes may be unhealthy until 1966, Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, Pub. L. No. 89-92, 79 Stat. 282, and did not require language explicitly warning that smoking causes lung cancer be printed on cigarette packages until 1985. Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, Pub. L. No. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2200 (requiring one of four rotating messages to appear on cigarette packaging, one of which included an explicit lung cancer warning).', '- 22 - of an arbitrator’s decision, which was thus subject to a far different standard of review, it is difficult to escape the definitive way in which this Court discussed the very Act in question.3', 'In clear and in no uncertain terms, and in a unanimous decision, this Court held that chapter 19.1 of title 45 was clear and unambiguous. The Court said that:', '“Upon a reading of the statute, it is evident that the General', 'Assembly intended to ensure that firefighters diagnosed with', 'cancer receive injured on-duty benefits in accordance with * * *', '§ 45-19-1[.] The enactment of the ‘Cancer Benefits for Fire', 'Fighters’ statute specifically designated cancer among firefighters', 'as an on-duty illness, based on the General Assembly’s findings', 'that firefighters are exposed to ‘a vast and expanding field of', 'hazardous substances’ and that the ‘rise in occupational cancer', 'among fire fighters can be related to the rapid proliferation of', 'thousands of toxic substances.’” City of East Providence, 982 A.2d', 'at 1288 (quoting § 45-19.1-1(a)(3)–(4)).', 'The Court then went on to say that, in view of its reading of the statute, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority, in that he had interpreted the law in the same way. City of East Providence, 982 A.2d at 1289. This is hardly mere dicta.', 'For the reasons set forth above, it is my opinion that the decree of the Workers’ Compensation Court is correct and should be affirmed in its entirety. I therefore respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority as relates to the effect of chapter 19.1 of title 45. 3', 'It is true that the issue in City of East Providence v. International Association of Firefighters Local 850, 982 A.2d 1281 (R.I. 2009), was whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in his determination that the grievant-firefighter should have been placed on injured-on-duty status during the time he missed as a result of prostate cancer pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 45-19-1, rather than being placed on sick leave. City of East Providence, 982 A.2d at 1283. Thus, it was not a disability pension case. However, there is no question that, after being put on injured-on-duty status for a period of eighteen months, a firefighter “shall” apply for a disability pension. See § 45-19-1 (emphasis added); see also § 45-21.2-9(a). In this case, the City of Cranston already had placed Mr. Lang on injured-on-duty status in accordance with § 45-19-1, and he remained on that status until his death from cancer.', '- 23 -', 'Justice Robinson, concurring. I am pleased to concur with the conclusion reached in the majority opinion and with its reading of the pertinent statutory provisions. Nonetheless, I write separately to respectfully reiterate my conviction that there are occasions when it is important for the General Assembly to speak with stark clarity when it wishes to enact into law a provision that represents a departure from the usual.', 'This is by no means a case where I could say that “the right answer” was instantly self- evident; instead, focused concentration on the actual statutory language was required. The dissent has set forth powerful arguments in support of its understanding of what the General Assembly intended, and I have carefully considered those arguments. In the end, however, I realized that I was required to look to what the statute actually says rather than to what may arguably have been the intent of the legislators. See Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003) (“The best evidence of [legislative] intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.”); see also Mutual Development Corp. v.

Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 616 (R.I. 2011). The plain blunt fact is that the General Assembly never used the word “presumption” (let alone “conclusive presumption”) in this particular statute. The General Assembly could have mandated that there be a conclusive presumption with respect to the cause of cancer in firefighters, but there is simply no clear language in the statute indicating that', '- 24 - the General Assembly did so. Where a provision as significant and as quite unusual 1 as the one presently in contention is concerned, it is especially important that the General Assembly be particularly clear as to its intent so that the judicial branch can properly fulfill its role of applying the statute to the case at hand. 1', 'The dissent reads the statute as clearly expressing the General Assembly’s intent to mandate what would be in effect a conclusive presumption that cancer in firefighters is caused by the various toxins to which they may have been exposed in the course of carrying out their firefighting duties.

The matter was previously before the Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues in the case should not be summarily decided.

They are largely derived from plaintiff’s amended verified complaint.1', 'On December 18, 2015, defendants purchased residential property at 217 Indian Avenue, Portsmouth, Rhode Island, which abuts plaintiff’s property. Both lots were created in 1960 subject to the same subdivision plan, which included certain restrictive covenants (the restrictive covenants or the restrictions). Paragraph three of the restrictions provides: “No building or buildings shall be erected, placed or altered on any lot until construction plans and specifications, and the plans showing the location of the structure have been approved in writing by a committee[.]” Paragraph four of the restrictions necessitates: “The location of any proposed two-story structure shall also be subject to approval of said committee.” Under the restrictive covenants, a majority vote of the committee was required for such approval.2', 'Throughout January and February 2017, defendants demolished a one-story home on their property and began new construction at that same location. In the beginning of April 2017, plaintiff discovered that defendants were building what he categorized as a “three-story structure.” The plaintiff contacted defendants via e-mail on April 10, 2017, complaining that defendants’ construction violated the restrictions because defendants had failed to obtain the required approval. On April 13, 2017, plaintiff, through counsel, demanded that defendants cease and desist all construction.', 'The defendants responded, arguing that the restrictive 1', 'Plaintiff filed his amended verified complaint on June 9, 2017. 2', 'We note that the location of the structure is not at issue here. A 1961 amendment to the restrictive covenants permitted a house to be built at its present location.', '-2- covenants were void, and requested a conference with plaintiff before plaintiff filed suit. Nevertheless, defendants continued construction.', 'Thereafter, in June 2017, plaintiff filed a civil action in Newport County Superior Court seeking “a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, damages and other relief in connection with his claims for violation of restrictive covenants and breach of the duty of quiet enjoyment, arising out of [d]efendants’ wrongful construction of a multi-story structure[.]”', 'After plaintiff commenced suit, defendants, on June 15 and 16, 2017, secured the approval for the already-commenced construction on their property from the owners of eight of the nine subdivision lots, plaintiff being the sole exception.3 The defendants then presented plaintiff with the approval, pursuant to the requirements of the restrictive covenants.', 'On July 6, 2017, defendants moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that the procedural approval requirement of the restrictive covenants, which plaintiff alleged defendants had breached, was satisfied and therefore plaintiff’s claim was moot. The defendants emphasized that the remedy plaintiff sought would only be temporary, as defendants had already obtained approval from a majority of the other lot owners, and defendants could therefore rebuild the same structure again.', 'The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motion for summary judgment and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff argued that defendants clearly violated the restrictive covenants in failing to get approval before they began construction, and he further averred that the restrictive covenants do not allow for retroactive approval.', 'Furthermore, 3', 'Notably, the approval indicated that the committee members “were not aware that the committee, nor the approval process contemplated by the [r]estrictive [c]ovenants, had continued to be applicable or in effect for the erection, placement or alteration of buildings on any lot or to approve fencing on the lots[.]”', '-3- plaintiff urged the Superior Court to adopt, for the first time, the Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes §§ 6:10 and 6:13 (2000), which address, respectively, committee members’ power to amend restrictions and whether the committee owed plaintiff a duty of good faith and fair dealing.4', 'On September 5, 2017, the hearing justice heard the parties’ arguments on their cross-motions for summary judgment and issued a bench decision. 5', 'The hearing justice concluded that “it would be absurd to grant injunctive relief in this case to disassemble a house only to have [defendants] reconstruct it after [they] already received approval.” He reasoned that the restrictions, when read as a whole, “appear to deal with a fluid process where approval may be gained in the middle of construction.” The hearing justice explained that the restrictions do not contain language that would prohibit approval at any time from the beginning of construction through its completion, and he accordingly granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, dismissing all claims in plaintiff’s amended verified complaint, and denied plaintiff’s cross-motion for summary judgment.

Arpin, 160 A.3d 314, 316 (R.I. 2017) (mem.)

The hearing justice noted as much when he stated that “it would be absurd to grant injunctive relief in this case to disassemble a house only to have [defendants] reconstruct it after [they] already received approval.” We agree with this assessment.', 'We have said that “[c]ourts of equity, in the exercise of their discretion, have frequently refused to decree specific performance when the relief sought would be of no practical benefit to the complainant but would cause trouble, inconvenience, and expense to the respondent, and such has been the policy of this [C]ourt.” Bochterle v. Saunders, 36 R.I. 39, 46, 88 A. 803, 806 (1913). Furthermore, “mandatory relief has been denied where it would provide no real benefit to the complainant but would cause substantial inconvenience to the respondent, even where permanent building encroachments or other obstructions of the way were involved.” Day v. Edmondson, 68 R.I. 382, 393, 27 A.2d 904, 909 (1942). 7', 'A Pyrrhic victory is defined as “[a] victory that is offset by staggering losses.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1436 (5th ed. 2011). It is a reference to Pyrrhus, “King of Epirus (306-302 and 297-272 [B.C.]), who defeated the Romans at Heraclea (280) and Asculum (279) despite his own staggering losses.” Id.', '-7-', 'We conclude that the relief sought by plaintiff would be a substantial inconvenience to defendant and provide no real benefit to plaintiff; it would merely delay the inevitable. See Day, 68 R.I. at 393, 27 A.2d at 909. While defendants failed to get approval prior to building, as required under the plain language of the restrictive covenant, they ultimately received that approval. Certainly, this is a case that would cause “trouble, inconvenience, and expense” to defendants with no practical benefit to plaintiff, for the reasons we have noted herein. See Bochterle, 36 R.I. at 46, 88 A. at 806.', 'While our pronouncements have in the past resulted in what can be characterized as “extreme measures” to enforce restrictive covenants and to prevent trespass, those past cases are easily distinguishable. For example, plaintiff relies on Cullen to support his argument that the hearing justice erred in deciding that defendants did not violate the restrictive covenants. In Cullen, the landowner filed suit against his neighbors seeking a preliminary and mandatory injunction for the neighbors’ violation of a restrictive covenant designed to protect ocean views. Cullen, 15 A.3d at 970-71. Unlike here, however, the defendant in Cullen ran afoul of the actual building requirements that were clearly created to protect the neighboring landowner’s view: “(1) the house footprint exceed[ed] the 4,500 square-foot restriction; (2) 8 percent of the roof exceed[ed] the thirty-foot height limit; and (3) 6.5 percent of the structure extend[ed] beyond the ‘no build line’ outside the Homesite Building Area.” Id. at 975.', 'At issue in the present case are not building requirements, but rather the requirement to submit plans for approval prior to building. Furthermore, nothing in the plain language of the restrictive covenants in this case indicates that the purpose of the building approval process was to protect a neighboring landowner’s view. Rather, the purpose of the approval, as set out in paragraph three of the restrictions, is to ensure “quality of workmanship and materials” as well as', '-8- “harmony of external design with existing structures[.]” As such, the restrictive covenant at issue in Cullen is discernibly different from the restrictive covenants at issue here. Additionally, in Cullen, in concluding in favor of the plaintiff, this Court’s opinion required that the defendant modify and rebuild portions of the house in compliance with the restrictive covenants. Cullen, 15 A.3d at 975, 980. Here, if plaintiff were to prevail, defendants would be required to demolish all or part of the structure and rebuild an identical structure, because defendants have the required approval to build.', 'Our opinion in Rose Nulman Park Foundation ex rel. Nulman v. Four Twenty Corp., 93 A.3d 25 (R.I. 2014), which exemplifies an “unfortunate situation,” is also distinguishable. Nulman, 93 A.3d at 28. In that case, the defendant erroneously constructed a $1.8 million home that encroached on the plaintiff’s property, which had been dedicated as a public park. Id. at 26. It was not until the defendant sought to sell the property and the potential buyer had the land surveyed that the fault was discovered. Id. at 27. Nevertheless, this Court upheld the trial justice’s grant of a mandatory injunction and order directing the “defendants to remove the structure and other improvements from the land belonging to the” plaintiff. Id. at 26, 28. Again, the facts in Nulman are distinct from the facts here, because plaintiff in the present case is not asking that the house be moved; the relief he requests would require defendants to tear down and rebuild an identical structure. See id. Such a remedy would be fruitless. See Guilford v. Mason, 22 R.I. 422, 430, 48 A. 386, 388 (1901) (recognizing “[t]he maxim that the law does not compel one to do vain or useless things”); cf.

Therefore, because there is no genuine issue of material fact left to be decided with regard to the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and because the requested relief for the defendants’ breach of the restrictive covenants would lead to a futile result, we hold that the hearing justice did not err in granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and in denying the plaintiff’s cross-motion for summary judgment.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

19,John Ferreira : v. : Child and Family Services of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, John Ferreira, is challenging the dismissal of his first amended complaint against the defendant, Child and Family Services of Newport County (CFS).1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2017, Ferreira filed a complaint in Newport County Superior Court, claiming that his former employer, CFS, defamed him and discriminated against him based on his age, 1', 'The plaintiff named “Child and Family Services of Rhode Island” as the defendant in his initial complaint, but served the complaint upon Child and Family Services of Newport County. He then amended the defendant’s name to “Child and Family Services (C&FS) of Newport Co[unty]” in his first amended complaint. Child and Family Services of Newport County is the proper party defendant in this case, despite the caption indicating otherwise.', '-1- gender, and “hostile environment[.]” The factual allegations asserted that Ferreira, who had been employed by CFS for nine years, resigned from his position after a newly hired clinician undermined him at the workplace by reporting false accusations against him to their supervisors, who in turn inappropriately disciplined Ferreira. CFS filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which a hearing justice of the Superior Court granted, in part for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because Ferreira had not exhausted his administrative remedies by obtaining the required right to sue letter from the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, and in part for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The dismissal was without prejudice, however, and Ferreira was given twenty days from the date of the decision to file an amended complaint.', 'Ferreira timely filed an amended complaint, adding a few new factual allegations and claims.2 Accepting the factual allegations in the amended complaint as true—as we must when we consider an appeal from the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Chariho Regional School District v. State, 207 A.3d 1007, 1012 (R.I. 2019) (Chariho)—Ferreira’s circumstances were as follows. He was over forty years old and had worked at CFS, a nonprofit agency, for nine years, having always received “good” evaluations. He was “very experienced with [CFS’s] clients.” In the summer of 2016, CFS hired a young, inexperienced female clinician, who “undermined” Ferreira by accusing him “of inappropriate communication and incompetence to management, co-workers and clients” and by “refusing to back him up when he tried to enforce policy with the clients.” CFS “treated the clinician better than they treated [Ferreira].” CFS summoned Ferreira to a disciplinary meeting, confronting him with the “young” clinician’s 2', 'Ferreira obtained a right to sue letter from the Commission for Human Rights prior to filing his amended complaint.', '-2- accusations as well as references to prior events for which Ferreira had not previously been made aware or disciplined. CFS presented Ferreira with a “last written warning[,]” which he refused to sign. One of Ferreira’s managers frequently told Ferreira, a retired police officer: “You’re not a cop anymore[,]” which Ferreira took to be a reference to his age. Ferreira “suffered stress, embarrassment, and financial hardship from these events[,]” “sought relief from his physician[,]” and was placed on stress leave. Ferreira resigned, but shortly thereafter attempted to rescind his resignation, which CFS “refused to accept” and “terminated [his] service while he was on stress leave citing his resignation.” Neither the initial complaint nor the amended complaint specified any dates, sequence, or chronology for these alleged events.', 'Ferreira asserted several claims in his amended complaint: Defamation (specifying all of its varieties: slander, libel, and false light); constructive termination; discrimination based on disparate treatment, age, and gender pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 112 of title 42 and G.L. 1956 § 28-5-7; and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. CFS responded with a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. At the conclusion of the hearing on this motion, the hearing justice dismissed the defamation claim and the claim of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and took the claims for discrimination and constructive termination under advisement. Over one month later, in a written decision, the hearing justice dismissed the remaining age and gender discrimination claims, as well as Ferreira’s claim for “constructive termination,” and dismissed the entire amended complaint, with prejudice. Ferreira challenges the dismissal of each claim in his amended complaint.3 3', 'As the parties are aware, the sequence of procedural events after the hearing on CFS’s motion to dismiss was somewhat convoluted and out of the ordinary procedural order. Ferreira’s claims of defamation and breach of good faith and fair dealing were dismissed at the May 7, 2018 hearing. On May 25, Ferreira filed a notice of appeal, listing the May 7 hearing date entered on the form as the “date of Judgment or Order Appealed From.” On May 31, the Superior Court clerk entered an', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The purpose of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is “to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Chariho, 207 A.3d at 1012 (quoting Pontarelli v. Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 176 A.3d 472, 476 (R.I. 2018)). When this Court reviews the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we apply the same standard as the hearing justice. Id. “[W]e assume the allegations contained in the complaint [are] true and view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[].” Id. (quoting Rein v. ESS Group, Inc., 184 A.3d 695, 699 (R.I. 2018)). “We will affirm a trial justice’s grant of a motion to dismiss ‘when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.’” Id. at 1012-13 (quoting Rein, 184 A.3d at 699).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before us, Ferreira argues that his amended complaint fulfilled the purpose of the general pleading rules by providing adequate notice to CFS of his claims for defamation, discrimination, constructive termination, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. He also asserts that his amended complaint should not have been dismissed with prejudice and that he should have been given leave to amend his complaint once again. CFS responds that the hearing justice order memorializing the hearing justice’s oral decision to dismiss the claims of defamation and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and to take the remaining counts under advisement. The hearing justice’s written decision granting CFS’s motion to dismiss the age and gender discrimination claims as well as the constructive termination claim entered on June 13, 2018. Final judgment, however, did not enter until September 13, 2019, after this case was scheduled for oral argument before us. Because the final judgment was eventually filed, we will address the dismissal of each of his claims.', '-4- properly dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice because the pleading lacked any factual allegations to support the required elements of the claims alleged in the pleading.', 'A', 'Defamation', '“To prevail in a defamation action, a plaintiff must prove: (a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (b) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and (d) damages, unless the statement is actionable irrespective of special harm.” Burke v. Gregg, 55 A.3d 212, 218 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Marcil v. Kells, 936 A.2d 208, 212 (R.I. 2007)); see also Shannahan v. Moreau, 202 A.3d 217, 231 (R.I. 2019). “With respect to the first element of defamation, a plaintiff must show that the statement is false and malicious, imputing conduct which injuriously affects a man’s reputation, or which tends to degrade him in society or bring him into public hatred and contempt.” Id. (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting Marcil, 936 A.2d at 212). However, “a pleading need not include the ultimate facts that must be proven in order to succeed on the complaint or * * * set out the precise legal theory upon which his or her claim is based.” Oliver v. Narragansett Bay Insurance Company, 205 A.3d 445, 451 (R.I. 2019) (quoting Rhode Island Mobile Sportsfishermen, Inc. v. Nope’s Island Conservation Association, Inc., 59 A.3d 112, 119 (R.I. 2013)). While a plaintiff in a civil action “is not required to draft the pleading with a high degree of factual specificity[,]” the plaintiff is responsible for “providing some degree of clarity as to what is alleged[.]” Hyatt v. Village House Convalescent Home, Inc., 880 A.2d 821, 824 (R.I. 2005). “[D]ue process considerations are implicated, and we require that ‘the complaint give the opposing party fair and adequate notice of the type of claim being asserted.’” Id. (quoting Butera v. Boucher, 798 A.2d 340, 353 (R.I. 2002)). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion “does not deal with the likelihood of', '-5- success on the merits, but rather with the viability of a plaintiff’s bare-bones allegations and claims as they are set forth in the complaint.” Id. at 823-24.', 'The hearing justice concluded that Ferreira had not alleged the required element of publication with the requisite level of specificity in the pleading and dismissed Ferreira’s claim that CFS had engaged in the tort of defamation. The hearing justice also concluded that the allegations of misleading and exaggerated statements regarding Ferreira’s work performance were insufficient to survive the motion to dismiss his cursory claims for slander, libel, and false light.', 'In his amended complaint, Ferreira alleged that the new clinician “undermined” him “by refusing to back him up when he tried to enforce policy with the clients[,]” “undermined [him] to management, co-workers, and clients[,]” and “accused [him] of inappropriate communication and incompetence to management, co-workers and clients.”', 'Ferreira also alleged that “[t]he administration * * * exaggerated [his] work history and rendered misleading descriptions of long prior work events that [he] had never been disciplined or warned about that called into question [his] competence[,]” “admitted to one of [his] co-workers that they had ‘pulled a shady’ on [him,]” and a manager frequently undermined his age by stating, “You’re not a cop anymore.” Ferreira does not allege, however, that any of the statements made by the new clinician or the supervisors were false. At the end of the amended complaint, under the heading “Counts,” Ferreira simply lists: “Defamation; including Slander, Libel, and False Light[,]” without any additional detail or allegations.', 'Mindful of the liberal pleading standards in our jurisdiction, we must decide whether alleging that a co-worker “undermined” or “accused” a plaintiff in the presence of clients and co- workers provides adequate notice to a defendant regarding the allegedly false statement published to an unprivileged third party. We have previously held that the use of the word “wrong” was, as', '-6- a matter of law, “too imprecise and vague to be verifiable as either true or false, and therefore, [it was] not actionable as a potentially defamatory communication.” Leddy v. Narragansett Television, L.P., 843 A.2d 481, 489 (R.I. 2004). In Leddy, the plaintiff accused the defendants of defamation after the defendants aired a news story about municipal employees who had retired with disability pensions working full-time for other government entities and who were collecting both a current salary and their disability pensions. Id. at 483-84. One of the defendants—a news reporter—had ambushed the plaintiff for an interview, and images of the reporter’s attempt to interview the plaintiff aired in a promotional advertisement for the news broadcast with a voice- over stating that, if viewers wanted to avoid talking to investigative reporters, they should refrain from doing “anything wrong.” Id. at 489.', 'In the instant case, the hearing justice concluded that this Court’s holding in Leddy prescribed a heightened level of specificity in the pleadings. We disagree. Leddy presented an appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment, not from a motion to dismiss, therefore the lens through which we evaluate the claim is completely different. See Leddy, 843 A.2d at 484. We held in Leddy that the voice-over’s statement in the advertisement was not defamatory as a matter of law and did not consider whether the allegations were sufficient to state a conceivable claim for defamation. See id. at 488, 489.', 'Although a claim for defamation may not be subject to a heightened standard of specificity in the pleadings, a defendant is entitled to “fair and adequate notice” of the basis of the claim asserted in a complaint. Hyatt, 880 A.2d at 824.', 'Ferreira’s allegations that defendant “undermined[,]” “accused[,]” and “exaggerated” are not equivalent to alleging that defendant published a false statement to a third party—here, presumably, CFS’s clients. These words are', '-7- not synonymous with “false,” and we therefore are of the opinion that Ferreira has not sufficiently alleged a claim for defamation, whether slander or libel.', 'Ferreira also listed the tort of “false light” as part of his defamation claim. In G.L. 1956 § 9-1-28.1(a)(4), the General Assembly created a broad individual right to privacy, including the “right to be secure from publicity that reasonably places another in a false light before the public[.]” “To prevail in an action for false light, a plaintiff must prove that there has been some publication of a false or fictitious fact which implies an association which does not exist; and the association which has been published or implied would be objectionable to the ordinary reasonable person under the circumstances.” Shannahan, 202 A.3d at 231 (brackets omitted) (quoting Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 752 (R.I. 2004)). Ferreira’s claim for false light was properly dismissed for the same reason as his claim for defamation: The amended complaint does not allege that CFS made any false statements about him.', 'B', 'Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing', 'The hearing justice dismissed Ferreira’s claim that CFS breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because Ferreira had not alleged that any contract existed—either express or implied through employment policy. It is well settled that “[v]irtually every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between the parties.” Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. v. Antonelli, 790 A.2d 1113, 1115 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Centerville Builders, Inc. v. Wynne, 683 A.2d 1340, 1342 (R.I. 1996)). “[W]e have [also previously] explained that a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not create an independent cause of action separate and apart from a claim for breach of contract.” McNulty v. Chip, 116 A.3d 173, 185 (R.I. 2015). Our review of the amended complaint reveals that Ferreira did not make any allegations', '-8- regarding the existence of an employment contract governing his employment relationship with CFS. Indeed, the allegations reveal remarkably little about Ferreira’s employment with CFS; the only relevant allegations in the amended complaint are that CFS is a nonprofit agency in Rhode Island and that Ferreira worked for CFS for nine years. Without alleging that a contract—express or implied—existed between himself and CFS, Ferreira has not properly pled a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.', 'C', 'Discrimination Claims', 'Ferreira also contends that he pled sufficient facts to state his claims for age discrimination, gender discrimination, and disparate treatment pursuant to § 28-5-7 and chapter 112 of title 42. The Fair Employment Practices Act, chapter 5 of title 28 (FEPA), prohibits employers from discharging an employee or discriminating against an employee on the basis of, inter alia, age, sex, or gender identity and expression. Section 28-5-7(1)(i) and (ii). The Civil Rights Act of 1990, chapter 112 of title 42, “provides all persons with ‘full and equal benefit of all laws’ regardless of sex or disability” as defined in FEPA. DeCamp v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., 875 A.2d 13, 20 (R.I. 2005) (quoting § 42-112-1(a)). We have previously noted that claims of age discrimination and sex or gender discrimination require a similar legal analysis and can therefore be considered simultaneously. See Neri v. Ross-Simons, Inc., 897 A.2d 42, 48 (R.I. 2006). This Court has also previously adopted the legal framework employed by the federal courts when considering these claims. Id. The plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of each claim. Id. at 48-49. With an age discrimination claim, the plaintiff must show that:', '“(1) [he or] she was at least forty years of age; (2) [his or] her job', 'performance met the employer’s legitimate expectations; (3) the', 'employer subjected [him or] her to an adverse employment action', '(e.g., an actual or constructive discharge); and (4) the employer had', '-9-', 'a continuing need for the services provided by the position from', 'which the claimant was discharged.” Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac', 'GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1170 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Neri,', '897 A.2d at 49). With a gender discrimination claim, the plaintiff must show that:', '“(1) [he or] she is a member of a protected class; (2) [he or] she was', 'performing [his or] her job at a level that rules out the possibility', 'that [he or] she was fired for inadequate job performance; (3) [he or]', 'she suffered an adverse job action by [his or] her employer; and (4)', '[his or] her employer sought a replacement for [him or] her with', 'roughly equivalent qualifications.” Neri, 897 A.2d at 49 (quoting', 'DeCamp, 875 A.2d at 21).', 'To withstand CFS’s motion to dismiss, Ferreira was required to plead allegations to satisfy the prima facie elements of his discrimination claims. Taking the allegations in Ferreira’s complaint as true, CFS did not actually discharge Ferreira from his employment. Ferreira resigned, and CFS terminated his employment on that basis. In the alternative, to sufficiently plead the adverse employment action of a constructive discharge, Ferreira had to allege that his working conditions had become so difficult that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. See Wellborn v. Spurwink/Rhode Island, 873 A.2d 884, 891 (R.I. 2005). While Ferreira alleged that he sought medical treatment for the stress resulting from the activity at work involving the new clinician, he did not allege that he felt compelled to resign.', 'Ferreira’s gender discrimination claim is also insufficiently pled because there is no allegation that, after he resigned, CFS sought a replacement for him with similar qualifications. The allegations in the amended complaint are clear that the new clinician was hired to fill a position that was “hard to fill[,]” and that this position was available before Ferreira resigned. Ultimately, the amended complaint does not include sufficient facts to allege a prima facie case of either', '- 10 - employment discrimination or a civil rights violation.4 We therefore affirm the hearing justice’s dismissal of Ferreira’s discrimination claims.', 'D', 'Dismissal with Prejudice', 'Ferreira also argues that the hearing justice erred by dismissing the amended complaint with prejudice, as opposed to providing Ferreira with another opportunity to amend his pleading. Our review of the record reveals that the hearing justice provided detailed reasoning in his written decision dismissing Ferreira’s initial complaint, including its deficiencies that led to the dismissal of all of the counts in that complaint. Clearly, Ferreira did not take any cues from the hearing justice’s first decision granting CFS’s motion to dismiss without prejudice when Ferreira drafted his amended complaint. As such, we agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that to provide Ferreira “with leave to amend for a second time would [have been] futile[.]”', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The record of this case shall be returned to the Superior Court.

20,"No. 2019-38-Appeal. (KD 18-59) Midland Funding LLC, assignee of Chase : Bank USA, N.A. v. : Tammy Turcotte Raposo. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Tammy Turcotte Raposo, appeals from the entry of two Superior Court judgments in favor of the plaintiff, Midland Funding, LLC (Midland), in these consolidated credit-card debt collection appeals. Raposo contends on appeal that the hearing justice erred in granting Midland’s motions for summary judgment. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issue raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments, we shall decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Midland filed two separate civil book-account actions in Third Division District Court alleging that Raposo owed Midland, as the assignee of Chase Bank USA, N.A., the unpaid balance due on two credit-card accounts. The first complaint sought to recover the sum of $2,200.82 plus', '-1- costs. Raposo answered the complaint with a letter in which she “den[ied] any and all statements set forth in [her] name” within Midland’s complaint and stated she had “no recollection or knowledge of” the claims asserted against her. Midland filed a motion for summary judgment. Raposo did not file an objection to the motion. The District Court granted Midland’s motion.', 'The second complaint sought to recover the sum of $9,705.78 from a different credit-card account in Raposo’s name. Raposo answered in a letter which stated that she had “no knowledge of this complaint[.]” Midland filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Raposo again did not file an objection. The District Court granted Midland’s motion.', 'Raposo appealed to the Superior Court from the judgments in both cases. Midland filed a motion for summary judgment in each appeal, to which Raposo objected, attaching identical affidavits in which she stated that, “[t]o the best of [her] knowledge,” she had never opened the accounts at issue or used the credit cards. Midland filed responses to Raposo’s objections, including billing records that detailed purchases and payments made by Raposo on both accounts.', 'The hearing justice consolidated the cases for argument. After reviewing the record and hearing arguments, the hearing justice found that Raposo’s affidavit was not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. The hearing justice reasoned that, without more than a “self- serving” statement that Raposo did not recall opening these accounts or using the credit cards, there was no basis upon which he could find an issue of fact as to the ownership of the accounts. Accordingly, the hearing justice granted summary judgment as to each of the two book-account claims, and final judgments were entered in favor of Midland for the full balance of each account plus costs. Raposo filed a timely notice of appeal from each judgment, and we consolidated the appeals before oral argument.', '-2-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. DiBattista v. State, 808 A.2d 1081, 1085 (R.I. 2002). “We will affirm a summary judgment if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” American Express Bank, FSB v. Johnson, 945 A.2d 297, 299 (R.I. 2008) (brackets omitted) (quoting Lucier v. Impact Recreation, Ltd., 864 A.2d 635, 638 (R.I. 2005)). “[A] litigant opposing a motion for summary judgment has the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id. (quoting Tanner v. Town Council of East Greenwich, 880 A.2d 784, 791 (R.I. 2005)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Raposo argues that the trial justice erred in granting Midland’s motion for summary judgment as to both book-account cases because, she asserts, she has set forth facts that established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the credit-card accounts were in fact her accounts. Midland counterargues that Raposo’s affidavit constituted only a conclusory denial and therefore was insufficient to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact.', 'Raposo asserts that her affidavit, in which she disclaims any memory of opening or using the credit-card accounts, created an issue of fact as to whether the accounts at issue were hers. However, it is well established that there is “an affirmative duty” on Raposo, as the adverse party responding to a motion for summary judgment, “to set forth facts showing that there is a genuine', '-3- issue of fact that will be resolved at trial. Such party must act diligently and in good faith to rebut the evidence presented in support of the motion.” American Express Bank, 945 A.2d at 300 (quoting Egan’s Laundry & Cleaners, Inc. v. Community Hotel Corporation of Newport, 110 R.I. 719, 723, 297 A.2d 348, 351 (1972)). The mere assertion that there are circumstances which, if believed, would serve to nullify Midland’s claim without any factual context is insufficient to place Raposo beyond the reach of summary judgment. See Egan’s Laundry & Cleaners, 110 R.I. at 723, 297 A.2d at 351.', 'Raposo’s reliance on Mitchell v. Mitchell, 756 A.2d 179 (R.I. 2000), in which this Court held that it could not pass on the weight or the credibility of evidence, even if weak or improbable, is misplaced. In Mitchell, the Court found that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a mother and her son had forgiven a debt owed by the mother’s other son (the debtor) to the family trust. Mitchell, 756 A.2d at 185. To establish the existence of a material fact, the debtor put forth his own deposition testimony and authored an affidavit that described the conversation in which his mother allegedly orally forgave the debt owed to the family trust. Id. at 184-85. The debtor also put forth the affidavit of his wife, which alleged that she was present when the mother orally waived the debt. Id. at 184. Moreover, the debtor pointed to context and clear assertions of fact in the record, including that the debtor’s mother gifted a deed to family property to her other son in an effort to reimburse him for the debt owed by the debtor. Id. at 184-85. The debtor asserted that, when the other son accepted the property, he impliedly waived his brother’s (the debtor’s) debt to the trust. Id. Lastly, the debtor put forth the affidavit of his mother’s close friend as support that his mother gifted the property to her nondebtor son to “equal * * * out” the funds gifted to each son. Id. at 183. The Court found that, however weak or improbable the debtor’s assertions', '-4- of “gift-giving” and “loan-forgiveness” appeared, enough evidence was asserted to create a genuine issue of fact. Id. at 185.', 'Here, in support of its motions for summary judgment, Midland presented billing records and credit-card statements that detailed both purchases and payments made on the credit-card accounts at issue. Those billing statements were addressed to Raposo at her home address. Raposo’s affidavit did not challenge any of the evidence presented in support of Midland’s motion and so failed to establish a material factual dispute to be resolved by a trier of fact. Raposo also failed to make any additional argument that she had not received the billing statements or provide any evidence to contest her liability as to the account balances. That Raposo was unable to remember opening credit-card accounts or using said credit cards to make purchases does not create a factual dispute regarding ownership of the accounts at issue. As such, Raposo failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact in these cases.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court and remand the papers to the Superior Court.', '-5- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Midland Funding LLC, assignee of Chase Bank USA, Title of Case', 'N.A. v.

21,Jamie Souza : v. : Michael Souza. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant father, Michael Souza (defendant), appeals from a Family Court order denying his motion for a new trial following a decision and order that denied his motion to change custody and awarded sole custody to the plaintiff mother, Jamie Souza (plaintiff).', 'On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial justice erred by overlooking and misconceiving evidence. He argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she determined that the defendant failed to carry his burden of demonstrating a substantial change in circumstances warranting the change of custody of his two children. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and vacate in part the September 17, 2015 order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant and the plaintiff were married on June 30, 1995. They are the parents of two minor children. The parties divorced in 2009. As part of their divorce, they entered into a marriage settlement agreement (the MSA). In the MSA, the parties agreed to joint custody of the', '-1- children with placement with plaintiff and with defendant having all reasonable rights of visitation.1', 'Thereafter, following the entry of final judgment of divorce, defendant moved to modify placement, seeking an order awarding him placement of the children. 2', 'A guardian ad litem (GAL) was appointed for the two children on August 18, 2010. The Family Court heard testimony on defendant’s motion over a four-year period.3 Both parties filed various motions to modify placement and custody during the trial. Additionally, during that time, there were periods when defendant had his visits modified, supervised, and, at some points, suspended. Specifically, his visits were suspended when the Department of Children, Youth, and Families became involved in two incidents that were “indicated” against defendant based on calls to the DCYF hotline. With regard to defendant’s motion to modify custody, the trial justice heard from “no less than fifteen (15) witnesses presented by [d]efendant[,]” including the GAL.', 'The plaintiff and the defendant also testified. Additionally, hundreds of exhibits were introduced at 1', 'The parties’ children were born on February 4, 2002, and May 8, 2004. It appears that the parties adopted the younger child from Korea when he was seven months old. It was additionally brought out in oral argument that a dependency petition was granted with regard to the younger child. Based on our review, this child remains in the custody of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, and the proceedings in that matter are ongoing. 2', 'In her decision that forms the basis of the order on appeal, the trial justice ruled on “Plaintiff’s Motion to Dismiss Defendant’s Post Final Judgment Motion to change custody” and on defendant’s “Motion to Change Custody.” Frequently, throughout that decision as well as in the submissions of the parties, the motion to change custody is referred to as a “motion to modify placement.” While the latter is a more generic term, which can encompass change of placement, visitation rights, or a change of custody, the trial justice ultimately decided the case on defendant’s motion for sole custody of the two children. As such, defendant’s motion for sole custody is the modification before us on appeal. 3', 'The hearings in this case span over six years and across two counties, with a total of 45 hearing dates. Such a large number of hearing dates is discouraged. Custody and placement determinations such as those presented in this case should be decided as expeditiously and efficiently as possible. We have not been apprised of an adequate explanation for the unreasonable delay in this case.', '-2- trial, including reports from DCYF regarding the two allegations of abuse against defendant and a report by the GAL.', 'After defendant rested his case, plaintiff moved to dismiss the motion to change custody, pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure, arguing that defendant had failed to meet the required burden of proof. On August 14, 2015, the trial justice issued a twenty-six-page written decision granting the motion to dismiss. In that decision, the trial justice noted that “it would be [defendant] as the moving party’s burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances existing at the time the decree was entered has so changed that custody should be modified in the interest of the child’s welfare” and “[a]s always, the best interest of the child must be considered.”', 'After reviewing the testimony of many of the witnesses at trial, the trial justice found that defendant had not met his burden of showing a substantial change in circumstances and that there was not any evidence to support the motion to modify in order to award custody of the children to him. She found that none of the testimony substantiated defendant’s assertions that plaintiff had mistreated or failed to provide for the children. The trial justice further found “by a preponderance of the evidence that these two (2) people cannot co-parent these children to the extent necessary to support the continued order of joint custody.” Based on that finding, the trial justice ultimately granted sole custody to plaintiff, and an order to that effect followed.', 'The defendant subsequently filed one motion both to reopen the case and for a new trial, pursuant to Rules 52 and 59 of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure, which was denied.

The defendant contends that the trial justice committed multiple errors in this respect. We address each of defendant’s contentions below.', 'The defendant begins by arguing that the trial justice “gave no weight” to the portions of the GAL report and testimony that characterized defendant positively and plaintiff negatively. Specifically, he argues that much of the GAL report paints plaintiff in a negative light, in that it reports that plaintiff ignored the younger child and, even further, that plaintiff had not wanted to adopt him. Based on these facts, as well as other factual findings by the GAL, the report recommended that defendant be awarded sole custody and primary physical placement of the children. The trial justice, however, was not required to act on that recommendation. Indeed, in D’Onofrio, this Court agreed with the conclusion of the New Hampshire Supreme Court that “[t]he recommendations of the guardian ad litem do not, and should not, carry any greater presumptive weight than the other evidence in the case. The guardian ad litem is appointed to represent the best interests of the child, not to make a conclusive or presumptive determination; that is the province of the court[.]” D’Onofrio, 738 A.2d at 1084 (quoting Richelson v. Richelson, 536 A.2d 176, 180 (N.H. 1987)).', '-5-', 'In her decision, the trial justice considered the GAL’s testimony, and she questioned the GAL’s recommendation on custody based on (1) the absence of a professional opinion on the effects of separating the children; (2) the GAL’s testimony that the younger child was the focus of her investigation and that defendant’s parents typically took the children during visits; and (3) other sources who told the GAL that defendant was not involved with the children or emotionally present and that he had never asked for more visitation. Additionally, she discussed the GAL report, noting that “[t]he court reviewed the GAL reports submitted as [d]efendant’s full exhibits A, B, and C.” The trial justice did not overlook the contents of the GAL report; rather, she considered it along with all the other evidence before her, as was required. See D’Onofrio, 738 A.2d at 1084.', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong to reiterate the findings by DCYF regarding two allegations of abuse by defendant.', 'According to defendant, the allegations should not have been weighed by the trial justice because the clear and convincing standard set forth in Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules for Juvenile Proceedings regarding the question of whether a child was abused, neglected, or dependent should have been applied. To support this argument, defendant references In re Sophia M., 204 A.3d 605 (R.I. 2019), arguing that the DCYF findings of abuse did not meet the clear-and-convincing-evidence burden. In re Sophia M., however, dealt with an abuse and neglect petition against the mother and father, whereas here, the issue of whether abuse occurred was not before the trial justice; rather, she considered the allegations of abuse as reported and testified to by DCYF in the context of a custody determination. See In re Sophia M., 204 A.3d at 605. The trial justice in the present case exercised her discretion in assessing the credibility of DCYF’s officers and reports, as well as the credibility of other witnesses involved in DCYF’s investigation. See In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d', '-6- 1227, 1232 (R.I. 2010) (“It is well established that ‘the task of determining the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly the function of the trial justice when sitting without a jury.’”) (brackets omitted) (quoting Parella v. Montalbano, 899 A.2d 1226, 1239 (R.I. 2006)). “This Court will not disturb findings of fact made by the Family Court on the issue of custody and the best interests of the child unless the trial justice abused [his or] her discretion in making a particular award.” McDonough v. McDonough, 962 A.2d 47, 52 (R.I. 2009). There is no evidence here of such an abuse of discretion, because the trial justice properly considered the credibility of the witnesses and reports before her.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong in her findings in four additional respects.', 'First, defendant argues that the trial justice “overlooked and/or misconceived” testimony that indicated that he was a better parent; defendant points specifically to the testimony of family members and the GAL report. Second, defendant argues that the trial justice’s finding that defendant was attempting to emotionally and financially ruin plaintiff was incorrect. Third, defendant argues that the trial justice was mistaken when she found that no other witnesses shared his view of the case. Fourth, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she found that defendant failed to substantiate his claim that the children would be better off in his custody.', 'With regard to each of these contentions, we conclude that there is no indication that the trial justice misconceived or overlooked evidence. Here, the trial justice in her decision found that defendant had “failed to provide any evidence that this [c]ourt would find to substantiate his claim that these children would be better off with him.” (Emphasis added.) Her decision suggests that she rejected the evidence submitted by defendant in support of his motion. Although defendant put forth evidence in support of his motion to modify custody at trial, it is', '-7- within the trial justice’s discretion to weigh that evidence in rendering her decision. See Ayriyan v. Ayriyan, 994 A.2d 1207, 1215 (R.I. 2010) (holding that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion where she carefully weighed the evidence and did not blindly accept all testimony and evidence before her as true). Although the trial justice did not go through the testimony of each witness or analyze each piece of evidence in her written decision, it is clear that she considered and weighed their testimony in rendering that decision. See Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 147 (R.I. 2008) (“A trial justice need not ‘categorically accept or reject each piece of evidence in his [or her] decision for this Court to uphold it because implicit in the trial justice[’]s decision are sufficient findings of fact to support his [or her] rulings.’”) (quoting Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 102 (R.I. 2006)).', 'Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in not allowing him to present tape recordings of the children into evidence. The defendant asserts that he should have been allowed to present the recordings to prove his innocence regarding the DCYF allegations of abuse, despite a court order barring such tape recording of the minor children. He asserts on appeal that “[t]he children were the best evidence.” Upon a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in preventing tape recordings from being admitted into evidence.', 'Indeed, it is clear from the record that the trial justice restricted the tape recordings from being entered into evidence to prevent further instances of the children “bringing tape recorders with them [to visits] in hopes of catching mother or father or somebody in a lie[.]” The trial justice made it clear that the purpose of that decision was to prevent interrogation of the children. “It is well established that the admissibility of evidence * * * is confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice; moreover, ‘this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” Giammarco v. Giammarco, 959 A.2d 531, 533 (R.I.', '-8- 2008) (quoting Soares v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 692 A.2d 701, 701-02 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)). We therefore decline to overturn a discretionary decision of the trial justice, who was in the best position to discern the admissibility of the tape recordings and who put forth a clear reason and rationale for denying their admission.', 'The trial justice did not overlook or misconceive evidence in determining that defendant failed to show a substantial change in circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude that she did not abuse her discretion when she denied defendant’s motion to modify custody and granted plaintiff’s motion to dismiss. Therefore, we will not disturb the trial justice’s denial of the motion for a new trial on appeal.', 'B', 'Sole Custody', 'The second issue before the Court is the fact that the trial justice, in the order granting plaintiff’s motion to dismiss, indeed modified custody by awarding sole custody of the children to plaintiff. The defendant takes issue with this decision, arguing that the “children are in harms way as long as they remain with Jamie” and by reiterating the two-part test required to modify custody or placement. If the two-part test is not met, “the prior custody decision should remain intact.” Vicente, 950 A.2d at 462.', 'Here, the trial justice changed the prior agreed-upon joint custody arrangement, which was memorialized in the final judgment of divorce in 2010, to sole custody in favor of the plaintiff, seemingly based upon the determination that the parties cannot co-parent, without reference to the best interests of the children. Awarding sole custody here goes a step too far. The plaintiff, to succeed on such a motion, would have to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that circumstances had changed such that the placement should be modified in the', '-9- interest of the children’s welfare and that the change of placement was in the best interests of the children. See Vicente, 950 A.2d at 462. Here, the trial justice applied no such test in concluding that the plaintiff should be awarded sole custody. We therefore vacate the portion of the order that awards sole custody to the plaintiff, and remand the case to the Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part the September 17, 2015 order of the Family Court and remand the case for further proceedings on the issue of sole custody.', 'Justice Flaherty did not participate.', '- 10 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Jamie Souza v.

In our judgment, the language of § 9-26-4(11) clearly and unambiguously provides an exemption for an IRA “as defined in * * * 26 U.S.C. § * * * 408.” Accordingly, the question we must ask ourselves is whether an inherited IRA is defined in § 408.', 'When we turn our attention to § 408, we find that § 408(a) defines “individual retirement account,” and § 408(b) defines “individual retirement annuity.” Later, in § 408(d)(3)(C)(ii), which deals with the rollover treatment of IRAs for tax purposes, it is provided as follows: 4', 'We note that 26 U.S.C. § 408A applies specifically to Roth IRAs, with which we are not concerned in this opinion.', '-5-', '“Inherited individual retirement account or annuity.--An', 'individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity shall', 'be treated as inherited if--', '(I) the individual for whose benefit the account or annuity', 'is maintained acquired such account by reason of the death', 'of another individual, and', '(II) such individual was not the surviving spouse of such', 'other individual.” Thus, we are tasked with determining whether the just-quoted language is a definition.', 'After a painstaking review of the statutory scheme at issue and after thoughtful consideration of the arguments of the parties, we simply have not been swayed from our considered judgment that the language of both § 9-26-4(11) and § 408 is clear and unambiguous. Section 408 clearly defines both individual retirement annuities and individual retirement accounts. Then said section goes further and, in the opinion of this Court, clearly defines an inherited IRA as well. See § 408(d)(3)(C)(ii). For the purposes of this case, it matters not that the term inherited IRA is defined in a statutory section devoted to the rollover treatment of IRAs for tax purposes. It is clear that the General Assembly included IRAs as defined in any and all parts of § 408, not just § 408(a) and/or (b). The General Assembly was certainly free to restrict exemptions to IRAs as defined in § 408(a) and/or (b). However, in this case, it chose not to do so.

We need not involve ourselves in this case with the venerable maxims of statutory construction or with weighing policy arguments for or against the appropriateness of an exemption in this case. Rather, we look solely to the pellucid dictates of the General Assembly. Accordingly, under the plain and ordinary meaning of the language in § 9-26-4(11) and § 408, an inherited IRA is defined under § 408, and it is, therefore, exempt under § 9-26-4(11).7 5', 'We are wholly in accord with the following jurisprudential principle nicely articulated by the United States Supreme Court:', '“[The Court’s] individual appraisal of the wisdom or unwisdom of', 'a particular course consciously selected by the Congress is to be', 'put aside in the process of interpreting a statute.

In that case, the Court ultimately concluded that, under the federal bankruptcy exemption statute, in particular 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(3)(C), the term “retirement funds” did not include inherited IRAs. Clark, 573 U.S. at 124, 133. In so doing, the Court discussed the factors that distinguish a traditional IRA from an inherited IRA—viz., the fact that holders of inherited IRAs may never invest additional funds into the account; the fact that “holders of inherited IRAs are required to withdraw money from such accounts, no matter how many years they may be from retirement;” and the fact that holders of inherited IRAs may “withdraw the entire balance of the account at any time—and for any purpose—without penalty.” Id. at 128-30. In Clark, the Court further addressed the policy reasons for exempting IRAs and determined that those policy considerations did not suggest that inherited IRAs should have exempt status under the federal bankruptcy statute. Id. at 129-30.', 'However, while Clark is certainly instructive, it is not controlling on this Court. The Court in Clark was construing the language of a federal statute, specifically the meaning of the term “retirement funds,” while the question before us involves completely different language contained in a Rhode Island state statute. Indeed, § 9-26-4(11) never uses the term “retirement funds.” Additionally, our General Assembly was certainly free to enact a statute that provides greater protections to the debtor than does its federal counterpart; and, in this case, it did so in a clear and unambiguous manner. See In re Pacheco, 537 B.R. 935, 940 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 2015) (determining that Clark did not apply to an analysis of Arizona’s state exemption statute and stating that “Arizona’s exemption law may allow a debtor to keep more than he or she could from around the country, each of those cases are governed by the particular language of the state statute at issue.

See Olsen, 210 A.3d at 435.', 'Furthermore, we are not swayed by the argument of the Trustee that subsection (iii) of § 9-26-4(11) somehow alters our interpretation of the “as defined in” language in that statute. Additionally, we are utterly unable to say that recognizing the presence of an exemption in this case constitutes an absurd result. See Mendes, 41 A.3d at 1002. Indeed, some states have expressly included inherited IRAs in their exemption statutes, which reinforces our conviction that the choice made by the General Assembly is a rational legislative decision devoid of any absurdity. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 33-1126(B); Fla. Stat. Ann. § 222.21(2)(c); Mo. Ann. Stat. § 513.430(1)(10)(f); Tex. Prop.

Third, the policy underlying such bankruptcy exemptions supports the conclusion that the term “inherited IRA” should not be morphed into the statute. I address each of these issues below.', '1', 'First, § 9-26-4(11) exempts “[a]n individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 408 and 408A[.]” A plain reading of § 9-26-4(11) indicates that only an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity may be exempt. The statute then directs the reader to §§ 408 and 408A for the limited purpose of obtaining definitions to those two terms.11', 'Section 408(a) is titled “Individual retirement account[,]” and § 408(b) is titled “Individual retirement annuity[,]” both of which serve as definition sections for those respective titles. The clear direction of our Legislature, therefore, was to consider §§ 408 and 408A for the definitions of these two terms. In my view, the statute is unambiguous, and that is where the analysis should end.', 'The majority, however, holds that § 9-26-4(11) is unambiguous but reads it to include inherited IRAs in addition to noninherited ones. Notably, the term “inherited” is absent from the language of § 9-26-4(11); yet, the majority concludes that the statute is unambiguous while at the same time reading in a word that is not present in the statutory language and that has a distinctly different definition from the terms listed. See Olsen v. DeMayo, 210 A.3d 431, 435 (R.I. 2019) (“If ‘a statute is clear and unambiguous we are bound to ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning of the words of the statute and our inquiry is at an end.’”) (quoting Town of Warren v. Bristol Warren Regional School District, 159 A.3d 1029, 1039 (R.I. 2017)). 11', 'Section 408A, the second statutory section readers are directed to in § 9-26-4(11), defines Roth IRAs. While I am of the opinion that inherited IRAs should not be read into the statute, a Roth IRA is covered because it is, for all intents and purposes, a retirement fund, comparable to a traditional IRA.', '- 11 -', 'The majority gleans a “definition” for inherited IRA from a discrete subsection of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 408(d)(3)(C)(ii), which a reader can find thirty-four paragraphs into the section. This subsection articulates under what circumstances an IRA shall be “treated as inherited[.]” Section 408(d)(3)(C)(ii). While §§ 408(a) and 408(b) clearly define the terms listed in § 9-26-4(11), § 408(d) refers to “[t]ax treatment of distributions.” Specifically, the term “inherited IRA” is being utilized in that subsection to determine whether the account should be “deni[ed] * * * rollover treatment[.]” Section 408(d)(3)(C). Section 9-26-4(11) refers to § 408 for the sole purpose of defining the terms “individual retirement account” and “individual retirement annuity[.]” The Internal Revenue Code’s treatment of tax distributions is not referenced in § 9-26-4(11) and has no bearing on the issue at hand. In order to draw the conclusion that inherited IRAs are exempt under § 9-26-4(11), a reader would have to first add a term into the statute that is not presently there, and second consult § 408 and read into its depths before finding a reference to the term.', 'As such, I would conclude that § 9-26-4(11) is unambiguous and does not include inherited IRAs.', '2', 'Second, an inherited IRA is clearly distinct from a noninherited IRA, such that it should not be included under the umbrella of the term “IRA.” An IRA is meant to be saved for retirement; accordingly, “Congress made certain withdrawals from both types of accounts subject to a 10 percent penalty if taken before an accountholder reaches the age of 59½.” 12 Clark v. Rameker, 573 U.S. 122, 125 (2014) (citing §§ 72(t)(1)–(2) of the Internal Revenue Code). Funds in an inherited IRA, in contrast, are available to an individual, without qualification, at any time. See id. An owner of an inherited IRA actually “must either withdraw the entire 12', 'Here, “both” refers to an IRA and a Roth IRA, which I addressed supra.', '- 12 - balance in the account within five years of the original owner’s death or take minimum distributions on an annual basis.” Id. (emphasis added) (citing §§ 408(a)(6), 401(a)(9)(B); 26 CFR § 1.408–8 (2013)). In this way, an inherited IRA is income, not a retirement account, as the traditional IRA is designed to be. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Glenshaw Glass Company, 348 U.S. 426, 431 (1955) (defining taxable income as “instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion”). Furthermore, “the owner of an inherited IRA may never make contributions to the account.” Clark, 573 U.S. at 125. Therefore, I would conclude that traditional IRAs are clearly distinct from those that are inherited.', 'Additionally, unlike the exemption of traditional IRAs in the Bankruptcy Code, which supports the policy considerations by helping to prevent debtors from becoming “destitute and a public charge[,]” the exemption of inherited IRAs would give debtors a “cash windfall[,]” because funds in this account are not set aside for the day when one can no longer work. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 129, 129 n.3. Rather, as set out supra, funds in an inherited IRA are available to debtors with certain minimums, but nothing prevents a debtor from withdrawing the money all at once. See id. at 125. Functionally, there is hardly a distinction between an inherited IRA and any ordinary bank account—and by my count, no jurisdiction in this country exempts ordinary bank accounts to this extent. Thus, a construction that treats an IRA and an inherited IRA as equal is incompatible with the policy considerations supporting the bankruptcy exemptions. Inherited IRAs should, therefore, not be read into § 9-26-4(11) as just another type of IRA.', '- 13 -', '3', 'Third, the policy underlying bankruptcy exemptions supports limiting § 9-26-4(11) to only include “an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.” While I do not disagree with the majority’s observation that this Court construes remedial statutes liberally, we have said that this Court “will not construe a remedial statute in a manner that would ‘defeat its evident purpose.’” Prew v. Employee Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 556, 563 (R.I. 2016) (quoting McCarthy v. Environmental Transportation Services, Inc., 865 A.2d 1056, 1062 (R.I. 2005)). It helps to remember that § 9-26-4 is an exemption statute. As such, it is reasonable to assume that the General Assembly’s purpose in providing for it is akin to Congress’s purpose in enacting the exemptions, set out in the United States Bankruptcy Code: “to provide a debtor ‘with the basic necessities of life’ so that she ‘will not be left destitute and a public charge.’” Clark, 573 U.S. at 129 n.3 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 126 (1977)). The exemptions are meant to “effectuate a careful balance between the interests of creditors and debtors.” Id. at 129.', 'I find support for my view from the United States Supreme Court’s unanimous holding in Clark. While the federal statute regarding exemptions is not identical to our own, it too refers to § 408 and, under Clark, the Supreme Court decided that, in spite of the reference to § 408, inherited IRAs are not exempt. Although not binding on this Court, as the majority points out, Clark does speak to the underlying policy of excluding inherited IRAs from exemption in bankruptcy proceedings. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 129-30.', 'In Clark, the Supreme Court concluded that a federal exemption allowing “debtors to protect ‘retirement funds to the extent those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue', '- 14 - Code[,]’” did not exempt inherited IRAs because funds in such accounts do not constitute a debtor’s “retirement.” Clark, 573 U.S. at 124 (emphasis added) (quoting § 522(b)(3)(C), (d)(12)). The Supreme Court’s opinion did not consider the issue of whether inherited IRAs were “exempt from taxation under any of the Internal Revenue Code sections listed[,]” including § 408, because the Court was satisfied that the federal exemption’s reference to “retirement funds” foreclosed the exemption of any nonretirement account. Id. at 126 n.2. The Court supported its opinion by considering the historic purpose for bankruptcy exemptions: Ensuring that a debtor is not left without the basic necessities of life or left to be destitute and a public charge. Id. at 129 n.3 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-595).', 'In my view, the purpose of the exemption statute is to provide debtors with a “fresh start” after bankruptcy by allowing them to still have a retirement fund to fall back on and to ensure that creditors cannot take everything. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 130.', 'It is plain to me that § 9-26-4(11) delineates that only IRAs, and not inherited IRAs, are exempt, because such a result is consistent with this intent. A reading to the contrary gives debtors a windfall and, thus, the policy of ensuring that debtors have a “fresh start” is perverted into granting debtors a “free pass[.]” Id.

Villanueva testified that, on December 4, 2016, she and her two young daughters spent the night at Croussette’s apartment. Villanueva testified that she woke up during the night when she felt Croussette get out of bed and saw him walk out of the bedroom. She then heard a loud bang on the glass sliding door, saw the glass from the door shatter on the floor, and then saw defendant coming through the glass sliding door. She testified that she could not see a gun, but she saw defendant point his hand directly at Croussette’s upper body, toward his face. Villanueva testified that she then heard a gunshot and watched Croussette fall to the floor. Next, Villanueva testified that she saw Mary standing next to defendant pulling at his coat saying, “Daddy,” while defendant then pointed the gun at Villanueva’s head. Villanueva testified that she did not see defendant leave; but, once she realized that he had left, she called an ambulance. Villanueva testified that no one else was in the apartment besides her, Croussette, her two daughters, and defendant, and that no one had a weapon except defendant. She testified that, shortly after she called 911, defendant called her from a private number and told her that “if [she] said his name, he was going to blow [her] brains out.”', 'Additionally, Villanueva testified that she listened to a recording of a phone call between two individuals—the ATF call—and recognized one of the voices as defendant’s because she', '-3- had spoken to him on the phone “[c]ountless times.”', 'Next, Villanueva testified, she was provided with a transcript of the ATF call and that some of the transcript was in Spanish. She further testified that Spanish was her primary language and that the translated transcript accurately reflected the conversation between defendant and the other person.', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel pointed to various inconsistencies between Villanueva’s in-court testimony and her prior statements to Providence police and at the grand jury proceedings in connection with this case. Villanueva conceded that, in her interview with Providence police after the shooting and at the grand jury hearing, she never mentioned that defendant had pointed the gun at her head. Villanueva further conceded that, in her statement to police, she did not tell them that she saw her daughter, Mary, tugging at defendant’s jacket moments after the shooting. On redirect examination, the prosecutor directed Villanueva to her testimony from defendant’s violation hearing in connection with this case. Villanueva confirmed that she was a witness at that hearing and that she had testified then that defendant pointed the gun at her after Croussette had been shot.', 'Next, Croussette testified for the state. Croussette testified that, on the date in question, Villanueva and her two children had slept at his apartment. Croussette testified that he awoke in the early morning hours when he heard footsteps on the patio outside the apartment. He testified that he went into the living room, turned on the lights to the patio, peered through the shades, and saw defendant standing in his yard. Croussette testified that he retreated into the bedroom to tell Villanueva to call the police and then heard a gunshot, followed by the sound of glass breaking from the sliding glass door. He testified that he told Villanueva to stay in the bedroom, and he went to get the girls from the living room to protect them. He then felt the impact of a gunshot penetrate his neck. Croussette testified that he fell to the floor and could hear defendant telling', '-4- Villanueva, “I told you so.” Croussette testified that, after defendant left, he was able to get up from the floor and go outside to wait for an ambulance, which eventually arrived and transported him to Rhode Island Hospital.', 'On cross-examination, Croussette conceded that his in-court testimony may have implied that defendant was the shooter, while in his grand jury testimony he stated that he did not see who shot him, notice anyone in his living room, or remember seeing defendant in his apartment. On redirect examination, however, Croussette clarified that his statements at the grand jury regarding what he saw in the living room both before the glass shattered and after were the same as his trial testimony.', 'The state called Mary as its next witness. Mary testified that, on the night in question, she and her younger sister, Jane, were asleep on the couch in the living room at Croussette’s apartment.3 Mary testified that she woke up during the night because she heard glass breaking from the sliding glass door. She testified that she then saw defendant coming through the door holding a gun. Mary testified that, shortly after entering the apartment, she heard defendant shoot Croussette and then saw him point the gun to her mother’s face and say, “What the F did I say.” Mary testified that she told defendant not to do it and that he then left. Mary testified that, after defendant left, Villanueva called the ambulance and police. On cross-examination, Mary conceded that she had testified before the grand jury that she had told her mother what happened to help her mother remember. On redirect, however, Mary clarified that she only reminded her mother about the part where defendant pointed the gun at her mother’s face, and that her mother then remembered exactly what happened, from her own point of view. 3', 'We also refer to defendant’s younger daughter, who was six years old at the time of trial, by a pseudonym for the protection of her privacy.', '-5-', 'The final witness called by the state was Christian Jardin, a special agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). Before Agent Jardin took the stand, however, defense counsel raised an objection. At sidebar, defense counsel voiced his objection to the state’s offering the ATF call into evidence, stating that “no warrant has been shown for the interception of the phone call. If there was an interception * * * there’s no ATF warrant for it. If it’s under the guise of a [confidential informant], he’s available and known. So the [confidential informant] should be here, because we know who he is.” Defense counsel also remarked about the transcript of the ATF call, stating: “There’s Spanish in it. We don’t know who the person who translated the Spanish is, and I think it should be a certified, independent translator, not an unknown staff member at the Attorney General’s Office.” The prosecutor contended that the recording is what controls and that he had provided defense counsel with a copy of the recording of the ATF call more than a week before the trial. The prosecutor further explained that he provided defense counsel with a copy of the translated transcript when the issue was first raised at the start of trial, and defense counsel had ample time to review it. He also noted that Villanueva testified to the accuracy of the translation. On the issue of whether the ATF call itself was admissible into evidence, the prosecutor stated that this was not a wiretap, but was an issue of one-party consent.4 Defense counsel argued that “[o]ne-party consent is between two private citizens, not a government agent and a private citizen[,]” and that defendant was in such a position that the “recording would’ve required a warrant[.]”', 'The trial justice ruled that the ATF call was “not a wiretap at all[,]” and was “a consensual recording.” Regarding the transcript, the trial justice stated that it was his “demand” 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-35-21(c)(2) provides that it is not unlawful for “[a] person acting under color of law to intercept a wire, electronic, or oral communication, where that person is a party to the communication, or where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to the interception[.]”', '-6- that the “bits and pieces” of Spanish be translated into English. The trial justice reminded defense counsel that a copy of the translated transcript was provided to him within two hours of translation and that he had invited defense counsel to have it reviewed. Finally, he noted that defense counsel never pointed to any inaccuracy in the transcript. With that, the trial justice overruled defense counsel’s objection.', 'After the sidebar concluded, Agent Jardin took the stand and testified that he became involved in the investigation with respect to the shooting when a confidential informant who worked for him placed a call to defendant. The following exchange occurred during the state’s direct examination of Agent Jardin:', '“[PROSECUTOR:] [D]id that confidential informant consent to', 'the recording of that telephone call?', '“[AGENT JARDIN:] Yes.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.', '“THE COURT: Overruled.', '“* * *', '“[PROSECUTOR:] And does this -- what’s on this CD accurately', 'have -- is it the phone call itself?', '“[AGENT JARDIN:] Yes.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.

Objection to the', 'transcripts, specifically because it uses the defendant’s name,', 'which is never mentioned on the tape.', '“THE COURT: Overruled.”', 'Following this exchange, the prosecutor requested to play the recording of the ATF call for the jurors and provide transcripts of the call to them. The trial justice gave the following cautionary instruction:', '“The transcripts, ladies and gentlemen, of this telephone call will', 'be circulated among you. Bear in mind that if you hear something', 'on the audio recording that does not correlate with what you see on', 'the printed page, it’s what you hear that controls, not what is on the', 'printed page[.] * * * Every effort has been made to transcribe the', 'telephone call accurately.

The transcript is simply an aid to assist', 'you as you listen to the recording.” The ATF call was played for the jury without further objection, and, shortly thereafter, the state rested its case. Once again, just before the jury deliberated, the trial justice reminded them that “it’s what you hear that counts. The transcript is simply an aid to assist you in listening to the audio recording.” No request for a specific instruction regarding the use of defendant’s name in the transcript was ever made.', '-8-', 'B', 'The Motion for a Mistrial', 'Subsequently, when the state rested its case-in-chief, information regarding the Rule 16 discovery in the case arose. See Super. R. Crim. P. 16 (providing for discovery upon written request by a defendant in a criminal case). The prosecutor informed the trial justice that the state had prepared two manila envelopes as part of its discovery package. Both packages had been left in the attorney general’s office for defense counsel to pick up; however, defense counsel picked up only one of the manila envelopes.', 'The prosecutor explained that, in the week preceding trial, he had provided defense counsel with a full copy of the grand jury transcript, along with a copy of the recording of the ATF call, and that defense counsel had all materials that the state relied on in the case. Defense counsel claimed that the package contained an enormous amount of information that he had never seen before that would have been useful in properly preparing a defense. Based on this assertion, defense counsel requested a mistrial. The state objected, claiming that the only documents that were not in defense counsel’s possession were the DVD videos of Mary and Jane’s CAC (Child Advocacy Center) interviews; police narratives, which were reflected within the grand jury testimony; Croussette’s medical records; and information retrieved from defendant’s cell phone, which the state did not use in its case-in- chief.5 The trial justice held an evidentiary hearing, outside the presence of the jury, based on defendant’s motion for a mistrial. The hearing lasted several hours that day and consisted of two witnesses from the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General. 5', 'The state claimed that the information from defendant’s cell phone contained only contact lists, the call log, and pictures of defendant holding a black firearm; however, that information was not used in the state’s case.', '-9-', 'After hearing from both witnesses, the trial justice examined the package that defense counsel had not retrieved from the attorney general’s office and questioned defense counsel. Defense counsel agreed that a DVD of the recorded ATF call had been hand-delivered to him on October 19, 2017.', 'Defense counsel informed the trial justice that he had handled the probation-violation hearing in connection with this matter. Defense counsel stated that both Villanueva and Croussette were witnesses at that hearing and that he received the reports from the police of their interviews. He also acknowledged having a copy of the violation hearing transcript. The trial justice also determined that defense counsel had the transcript of Mary’s CAC interview, which was contained within the transcript of her grand jury testimony. Defense counsel then informed the trial justice that he had the CD with a recording from the grand jury proceedings and that he had listened to that CD. Defense counsel ultimately conceded that what he did not have were the videos of Mary or her sister Jane’s CAC interviews, or the additional photographs of the crime scene. The trial justice looked through the forty photographs that defense counsel had not received and determined that defendant was not prejudiced by not having them.', 'Based on the information the trial justice elicited from defense counsel and the testimony presented, he denied both the request for a mistrial and a continuance, stating that defense counsel “had everything at his disposal that he could have had and should have had. The fact that he inadvertently did not pick up this material is no basis for a later self-serving request for a continuance.”6 The trial justice found that “[n]othing was hidden from the defense whatsoever”; however, he did offer that defense counsel could admit all the additional photographs of the 6', 'Despite initially denying defense counsel’s request for a continuance, the trial justice ultimately offered one to him.

Defense counsel declined that request.', 'While the jury was deliberating, the trial justice held a conference in chambers. Defense counsel wanted to make the record clear that he did not “in any way, shape, or form believe that the Attorney General’s Office failed to deliver” the discovery in this case, and that he did not fault the prosecutor in any way. Subsequently, the jury found defendant guilty on all counts. The defendant then filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury’s verdict was inconsistent with the evidence and failed to do substantial justice. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion.', 'On March 15, 2018, the trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment on count one; fifty years to serve on count two, concurrent with count one; ten years to serve on count four, also concurrent with count one; twenty years to serve on count five, consecutive to count one and nonparolable; ten years to serve on count six, consecutive to count four and nonparolable; and ten years concurrent with count one on counts seven and eight. The defendant was also sentenced to a nonparolable term of twenty-five years as a habitual offender. All sentences were to begin after defendant completed the term he was currently serving as a probation violator.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by admitting both the recording and transcript of the ATF call into evidence, by failing to grant a mistrial when it became clear', '- 11 - that defense counsel did not possess the complete discovery package prior to trial, and by denying his motion for a new trial.7', 'A', 'Admission of the ATF Call Recording and Transcript', 'The defendant raises three arguments in support of his contention that the trial justice erred when he admitted the recording and transcript of the ATF call: (1) the state failed to establish that the confidential informant freely and voluntarily consented to the telephone call; (2) neither the audio recording nor the transcript was properly authenticated; and (3) the state resolved a crucial question of fact for the jury by identifying the recipient of the call as defendant.', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.” State v.

Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013)).', '2', 'Analysis', 'First, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by admitting the recording of the ATF call because, he alleges, the state did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the confidential informant freely and voluntarily consented to the recording. Specifically, defendant asserts that Agent Jardin’s “bare bones testimony” regarding the confidential informant’s consent was not enough to meet the state’s burden of proof.', 'Our careful review of the record, however, reveals that defense counsel never raised the issue of whether the confidential informant freely and voluntarily consented to the recording of the phone call with defendant. Instead, at sidebar before the state offered the recording into evidence, defense counsel argued that the one-party-consent rule was not applicable at all because one-party consent is between two private citizens, not a government agent and a private citizen. Accordingly, defense counsel maintained that the ATF agents were required to obtain a warrant to record the phone call because the confidential informant was a government agent.', 'Subsequently, when the state questioned Agent Jardin regarding the confidential informant’s consent, defense counsel voiced a blanket objection, but never articulated any specific grounds for that objection. While defense counsel mentioned that the confidential informant was known and should testify, he never alerted the trial justice to the specific allegation of whether the state adequately proved that the confidential informant freely and', '- 13 - voluntarily consented. For this reason, our so-called “raise-or-waive” rule precludes defendant from raising that issue on appeal. See Romero, 193 A.3d at 1172 (requiring “a specific objection at trial” in order to allow the trial justice to rule on the objection).', 'Second, defendant argues that neither the ATF recording nor the transcript of the ATF call was properly authenticated. In accordance with the raise-or-waive rule, however, we are of the opinion that this argument has also been waived. See Romero, 193 A.3d at 1172. While the record is replete with blanket objections and more specific objections as to why the recording should not be admitted, defense counsel never objected based on authentication. Accordingly, because this argument was not raised before the trial justice, it is now precluded on appeal. See id.', 'Therefore, we need only address defendant’s third claim—namely, that the trial justice erred when he did not independently determine whether the transcript of the ATF call was accurate, and that the inclusion of defendant’s name in the transcript, despite the audio recording not identifying defendant as the speaker, influenced the jury into relying on the transcript’s representation that defendant was the shooter.8 We disagree with both contentions.', 'We have stated that “the primary concern of the trial court when transcripts are used is their accuracy.” State v. Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d 1070, 1082 (R.I. 1981). “Admission of transcripts into evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v.

Again, however, defense counsel never objected on these grounds at trial, nor did he bring these specific issues to the attention of the trial justice. Accordingly, the raise-or-waive rule precludes us from addressing these issues on appeal. See State v.

Prior to trial, and in accordance with our holding in Ahmadjian, the trial justice reviewed the transcript and determined that there was “some Spanish conversation, which for some reason was not transcribed into English.” The trial justice explained that he would not allow the transcript to be used unless the Spanish portions were also translated and included in the transcript, in order to make the transcript complete.', 'The fact that the translation was performed by an employee of the attorney general’s office and its accuracy confirmed by Villanueva, one of the prosecution’s only three witnesses, hardly inspires confidence in the reliability of the translated transcript. However, the use of Spanish was relatively minor, it was only the confidential informant who spoke in Spanish, defendant had ample opportunity to have the translated transcript reviewed by a court-certified interpreter, and there is no suggestion in the record that the translation was not in fact accurate. Although the better practice would have been to have the non-English portions of the conversation translated by a court-certified interpreter, under these circumstances we are convinced that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the transcript into evidence.', 'Additionally, we do not believe the trial justice abused his discretion by admitting the transcript even though it included defendant’s name. Before the transcripts were distributed to', '- 15 - the jury, three eyewitnesses connected defendant to the shooting. Moreover, Villanueva testified that she listened to the recording of the ATF call and that she recognized defendant’s voice on the call—an observation she was clearly qualified to render, in that defendant was her husband for seven years, from 2008 until 2015. Similarly, Agent Jardin testified that the confidential informant placed a call to defendant and provided him with a recording of that call. Finally, the content of the ATF recording itself validated the testimony from all three eyewitnesses regarding the shooting.', 'Most importantly, regarding our determination that he did not abuse his discretion when he admitted the transcript, the trial justice gave two cautionary instructions to the jury. First, the trial justice informed the jurors that “the transcript is not controlling. It is what you hear on the tape or the CD that’s controlling. The transcript is simply an aid to assist you as you listen to the recording.” Second, just before the jury deliberated, the trial justice reminded them that “the recording is the evidentiary piece that is paramount, and not the transcript. * * * [I]f you hear something on the audio that doesn’t correlate with what’s on the printed page, it’s what you hear that counts.” A more specific instruction regarding the use of defendant’s name in the transcript was never requested.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he admitted the transcript of the ATF call into evidence.', 'B', 'Motion for a Mistrial', 'Next, defendant avers that the trial justice erred by failing to grant a mistrial when it became evident that defense counsel did not possess or review the complete discovery package prior to trial.

See Rosado, 139 A.3d at 424 (setting out factors when considering alleged discovery violation under Rule 16). Second, the trial justice was in the best position to determine whether defendant was prejudiced by the nondisclosure, and the trial justice found that he was not. The trial justice determined that defense counsel had all the statements from the three eyewitnesses prior to trial, based on the fact that defense counsel had represented defendant at the violation hearing and indeed used that information to impeach all three of those eyewitnesses at trial. The trial justice examined the additional crime scene photographs that defense counsel did not have prior to trial, and he determined that there was no prejudice to defendant by not having them. Although defense counsel did not have Jane’s audio statement and the information from defendant’s cell phone, the state did not use that material at trial. Further, the trial justice offered defense counsel the opportunity to admit those materials into evidence if he found them helpful, but defense counsel declined the offer.

The trial justice was in the best position to determine whether defendant suffered any prejudice by not having those materials prior to trial and determined that he did not.', 'Accordingly, there was not clear error in the trial justice’s finding that defendant was not prejudiced by the nondisclosure and therefore there is no reason to disturb those findings.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant also claims that the trial justice erred when he failed to grant the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

On the day the couple met, Emily was walking to her job at a fast-food restaurant when Belen approached her in his car. From this chance encounter, Belen and Emily became friends, a friendship that quickly developed into a romantic relationship. After they dated for a few months, Belen and Emily moved together to an apartment in Woonsocket. 1', 'To protect the anonymity of the complaining witness, we have used a pseudonym in place of the victim’s name in this opinion.', '1', 'Belen was not working at that time, and soon thereafter Emily lost her job. Emily testified at trial that, at Belen’s insistence, she became an “escort.” Emily testified that Belen “was pretty persistent so eventually [she] just gave in.” While Emily was working as an escort, Belen would drive her to and from her appointments with her customers.', 'In the early morning of April 1, 2014, Emily claimed that she was sexually assaulted by Belen in their shared apartment. Just days before the assault, Belen and Emily had cavorted with an unnamed woman at a motel in Warwick, and, she testified, the three had engaged in a variety of consensual sex acts during their overnight stay. After their weekend frolic, Emily and Belen returned to their apartment. Emily described Belen’s demeanor at that time as “[e]xtremely hostile.” Emily testified that, as a result, she “tried to keep [her] distance” that night. However, some time during the night Emily noticed that the battery to her cell phone had been removed.', 'The next morning, Belen woke Emily and asked whether she had smoked their last cigarette. She told him that she had in fact smoked it. At that response, Emily said that, an apparently enraged Belen began to physically assault her. According to Emily, Belen then began to assault her sexually and physically over the course of the next two hours, at times raping her with a hair mousse bottle. She said that she was naked and bleeding from her nose because of the physical and sexual abuse. According to Emily, Belen, while cleaning up blood, became more agitated at the fact that she was bleeding in the bathroom where he was assaulting her. She testified that Belen closed all the windows and played music to cover up the clamor caused by the assault.', 'At some point, Belen strangled Emily and she passed out. Emily testified that after she regained consciousness she told Belen that she was feeling lightheaded and that she needed to eat something. Belen then permitted her to go to the kitchen to heat up some food. When Belen turned his back on her to go back to the bathroom, Emily covered her naked body with a sheet and fled', '2 the apartment. She said that she ran downstairs and banged on a neighbor’s door. The neighbor allowed her to come into the apartment and provided a phone so that Emily could call the police.', 'When the police arrived, Belen was no longer in the apartment. Emily was transported to the hospital by ambulance. At the hospital, a nurse performed an examination using a “sexual assault kit.” At trial, an expert witness called by the state testified that Belen’s DNA had been found on the can of hair mousse that Emily claimed had been used in the sexual assault. Belen’s DNA was also present on swabs obtained from Emily’s body. Under cross examination, the expert conceded that the DNA on the swabs could have been the result of consensual sex that may have occurred from thirty-six to forty-eight hours before the test was administered to Emily.', 'Emily’s neighbor testified at trial and said that she had not heard any screaming, banging, or loud music emanating from the apartment shared by Emily and Belen. However, she also testified that a frantic and hysterical Emily appeared at her door that morning clothed only in a sheet.', 'On August 18, 2014, a grand jury indicted Belen on four counts of first-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2. Prior to the indictment, Belen, who was being held without bail, made several phone calls to Emily. Those calls were recorded by the Adult Correctional Institutions, and one of them was played for the jury at trial. Significantly, the trial justice had granted defendant’s motion in limine and ordered that the fact that the call was originally from the ACI be redacted. In the recorded phone call played for the jury, Belen apologized to Emily, telling her that he made a mistake, he was not in his right state of mind, and he was only human.2 Emily in response called Belen a monster, to which Belen replied: “Listen, even monsters make mistakes.” 2', 'We rely on the state’s transcript of the call, because Belen did not challenge its accuracy at trial.', '3', 'At the close of evidence, and during her final argument, the prosecutor made two statements that lie at the heart of this appeal. First, the prosecutor inadvertently referred to the “ACI” when she discussed the recorded phone conversation that had been played for the jury.3 In her statement, the prosecutor said: “One thing you will have upstairs with you in the jury deliberation room is the ACI—excuse me, is the phone call [Emily] told you about.”', 'Second, also during her closing argument, the prosecutor said the following about the victim’s testimony:', '“In addition to telling these stories, as long as [defense counsel] is', 'going to make gender based arguments, I don’t know about all the', 'women on the jury, but I hate getting pap smears and a yearly exam', 'and that is one more thing she had to do that morning. When you', 'heard from the nurse, in order to have a sexual assault kit done, and', 'she was told and she gave consent that she would have a speculum', 'inserted into her vagina to take the vaginal swabs and then also', 'taking of the anal swabs. Again, one more thing to ask yourself,', 'why would she lie? Why would she make all this up? Doesn’t make', 'sense?”', 'Belen’s attorney objected to the reference to the ACI after the prosecutor’s closing argument had concluded. In addition, the trial justice, sua sponte, raised the issue of the prosecutor having related her personal experience as part of her final argument. The trial justice ruled that both of those comments were improper, and he suggested that he provide the jury with a cautionary instruction. Belen declined the trial justice’s offer of a cautionary instruction, but he did make a move to pass the case based on the reference to the “ACI.”4 The trial justice denied that motion because, he said, the jury was not “so tainted that they could not continue to deliberate and render a fair and impartial verdict[.]” 3', 'It is not disputed that the prosecutor’s reference to the ACI was inadvertent. 4', 'In Rhode Island, the terms “motion to pass” and “motion for a mistrial” are used interchangeably.', '4', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all four counts of first-degree sexual assault. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to four concurrent life sentences. Belen timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Roscoe, 198 A.3d 1232, 1237 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 197 (R.I. 2012)). “We have often stated that the trial justice has a front row seat during the trial so that he can best evaluate the effects of any prejudice on the jury.” Id. (quoting Dubois, 36 A.3d at 197). “The ruling of the trial justice is accorded great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly wrong.” Id. (deletion omitted) (quoting Dubois, 36 A.3d at 197).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, Belen argues that the trial justice erred by (1) failing to grant his motion to pass the case after the prosecutor made an inappropriate remark during her closing argument when she referred to the “ACI,” and (2) failing to pass the case after the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of the victim during her closing argument.', 'A', 'ACI Reference', 'Belen first takes issue with the prosecutor’s inadvertent and brief reference to the ACI during her closing argument. However, before we address this issue, we must first determine whether the issue is properly before us. “To preserve an objection to a prosecutor’s closing argument, defense counsel must not only make an objection at the time, but must make a request', '5 for a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial.” State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1018 (R.I. 2014) (deletion omitted) (quoting State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 964 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The record is pellucid that Belen did voice an objection and that he moved for a mistrial. What is also clear, however, is that Belen did not contemporaneously object at the time the prosecutor made her statement.', 'The relevant sequence of events is as follows: The trial justice chose to instruct the jury before closing arguments, not after, in this case. After the prosecutor’s closing argument, the trial justice determined that he should give one additional instruction.5 When he did so, the trial justice inquired if either party needed a sidebar regarding the jury charge. At that time, Belen’s attorney raised his objection to the prosecutor’s reference to the ACI, and he moved for a mistrial.', 'Although the objection was not made immediately following the prosecutor’s comment, it is our opinion that, under the circumstances before us, the objection was nonetheless timely. In State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881 (R.I. 2002), we held that, in certain limited circumstances, objecting after the prosecutor had completed his closing argument might preserve the objection. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 884. Here, the prosecutor, in a slip of the tongue, used the term “ACI” in the middle of a sentence. She immediately realized her mistake, and she moved on without further incident. It was therefore unnecessary for defense counsel to lodge a contemporaneous objection in an effort to stop the prosecutor from continuing to discuss Belen’s incarceration, a subject that had been prohibited by the trial justice. Given the context of the remark, Belen’s objection was timely even if not made immediately following the prosecutor’s remark. 5', 'The trial justice’s instruction explained, in part, the rule that, in rendering a verdict, the jurors must be unanimous and must agree on the verdict.', '6', 'Thus, we turn to the merits of the issue. “There is no formula in law which precisely delineates the proper bounds of a prosecutor’s argument.” Roscoe, 198 A.3d at 1237 (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting State v. Tucker, 111 A.3d 376, 388 (R.I. 2015)). “Prosecutors enjoy ‘considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.’” Id. (quoting State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 1007 (R.I. 2008)). However, we have held that if a prosecutor’s remarks are “totally extraneous to the issues in the case and tend to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury[,]” then such comments are improper. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885 (quoting State v. Mancini, 108 R.I. 261, 273, 274 A.2d 742, 748 (1971)). To merit a mistrial, the statement must not only be improper, but also so prejudicial that a cautionary instruction would be insufficient to cure the prejudice. State v. Martinez, 624 A.2d 291, 294 (R.I. 1993). “This [C]ourt has * * * recognized that there is no fixed formula for determining whether a particular statement is prejudicial.” Id. “Rather, we must evaluate the statement’s probable effect upon the outcome of the case.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Pugliese, 117 R.I. 21, 26, 362 A.2d 124, 126-27 (1976)).', 'There is no doubt in our minds that the prosecutor’s comment was improper. The issue remains, however, whether the comment was so prejudicial in the context of this case that the failure to grant a mistrial rises to an abuse of discretion. “This [C]ourt has previously recognized that knowledge of a defendant’s incarceration may have a serious prejudicial influence on the jury.” Martinez, 624 A.2d at 294. “The prejudicial effect that may arise from the jury’s knowledge of a defendant’s incarceration results from the likelihood that the jury will infer that the defendant is incarcerated as a result of previous criminal activity and is thus possessed of a general criminal disposition.” Id. (quoting State v. Burke, 529 A.2d 621, 628 (R.I. 1987)).', '7', 'Belen argues that this case is similar to Pugliese and, thus, a mistrial was required. See Pugliese, 117 R.I. at 27, 362 A.2d at 127 (holding that reference to the ACI in that case was prejudicial because there was a reasonable possibility that it might have influenced the jury’s decision). In our opinion, however, Belen’s reliance on Pugliese is misplaced. In Pugliese, the state’s only identification witness referred to the defendant’s incarceration during the course of his testimony. Id. at 125. The witness made the reference while the state was attempting to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility after the witness had recanted his identification of the defendant as the perpetrator. Id. When the state asked the witness whether anyone had approached the witness about his testimony, the witness responded that a man had approached him and that the man said “he was Pugliese’s friend from up at the A.C.I.” Id.', 'The defendant objected and moved for a mistrial. Pugliese, 117 R.I. at 27, 362 A.2d at 125. The trial justice denied the motion and did not offer to provide a cautionary instruction. Id. at 126. During jury deliberations, the jury, after nearly five hours of deliberation, sent a note to the trial justice saying they could not reach a verdict. Id. at 127. The trial justice urged the jury to continue to deliberate and break the impasse. Id. The jury returned a guilty verdict almost an hour later. Id. The jury attached a note to the verdict that said: “We have reached a verdict. God help us.” Id. On appeal, this Court vacated the defendant’s conviction. Id. We are led to the conclusion that this Court vacated the conviction for three reasons, all of which were based on the reference to the defendant’s incarceration. Id. First, this Court was unable to conclude that there had not been an impact on the jury. Id. Second, the reference to the defendant’s incarceration was made by a witness, during the state’s attempt to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility. Id. at 125. Finally, the evidence of guilt was far from overwhelming. Id. at 126.', '8', 'The present case is distinguishable from Pugliese. There is nothing in the record that would indicate or even allow us to infer that the comment had any impact on the jury’s deliberations. In fact, from his front-row seat, the trial justice observed that the abortive remark had “just slid past” the jurors.', 'Furthermore, the prosecutor made the unintentional remark during her closing argument; it was not uttered by a witness nor did it have any impact on the credibility of a witness. Finally, even though there is no overwhelming evidence of guilt in this case, there is substantially more evidence of guilt than was present in Pugliese. In Pugliese, the state’s witness who identified the defendant had only briefly seen the defendant’s face. Pugliese, 117 R.I. at 24, 362 A.2d at 125. The state’s other witness was unable to identify the defendant as the perpetrator. Id. In the case at hand, even though the case essentially came down to the credibility of Emily, there was additional corroborating evidence to support Emily’s allegations including physical evidence and Belen’s own recorded statements.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial justice acted within his discretion in refusing to pass the case. The trial justice found that the comment likely had little impact on the jury because the comment, in the trial justice’s words, “just slid past” them. The context of the reference supports this conclusion. The term “ACI” was dropped by the prosecutor into a completely unrelated sentence. The term was a non sequitur because it added nothing to the meaning of the sentence. We cannot fathom that it was of such consequence to have had a prejudicial impact on the jury.', '9', 'B', 'Improper Vouching', 'Belen next takes issue with the prosecutor relating her personal experience during her closing argument.6 However, the state argues that Belen waived this argument by failing to properly object or move for a mistrial.', 'As we have said, “[t]o preserve an objection to a prosecutor’s closing argument, defense counsel must not only make an objection at the time, but must make a request for cautionary instructions or move for a mistrial.” Whitfield, 93 A.3d at 1018 (deletion omitted).', 'Here, defense counsel objected neither at the time the prosecutor made her comments nor at the sidebar, nor did defense counsel move for a mistrial or request a cautionary instruction. In fact, it was the trial justice who, sua sponte, raised the issue after closing arguments. At that time, the trial justice ruled that the comment was improper, but he also explained that a mistrial was unwarranted. In response, defense counsel candidly said:', '“I will say, your Honor, I did hear [the prosecutor’s] statement about', 'that speculum or whatever the heck it is called and while I personally', 'have no experience with it, I had because it was passing and', 'maybe—well, I didn’t object.” 6', 'The trial justice referred to the prosecutor’s personalization as violating what is sometimes known as the “golden rule.” On the other hand, Belen argues that the personalization was in fact improper vouching. This Court has never embraced or even defined the doctrine of the “golden rule”; however, the Supreme Court of Connecticut has stated that a golden rule argument “urges jurors to put themselves in a particular party’s place or into a particular party’s shoes[.]” State v. Stephen J.R., 72 A.3d 379, 393 (Conn. 2013) (deletion omitted). We have defined improper vouching as a prosecutor’s argument that introduces the prosecutor’s own experience or evidence not in the record to bolster the credibility of a witness. Jaiman v. State, 55 A.3d 224, 237 (R.I. 2012). Nonetheless the difference between these two doctrines is not relevant to this appeal. The trial justice in the present case found that the comment was improper. Thus, the ultimate focus is on whether it was prejudicial. We therefore decline to distinguish whether the prosecutor’s remark constituted either vouching or a violation of the “golden rule.”', '10 Thus, because counsel did not press an objection, move for a mistrial, or request a curative instruction on that issue, it has been waived.', 'In any event, we find no fault with the trial justice’s ruling.', 'We agree that the personalization by the prosecutor was ill advised but conclude that it was not prejudicial to the extent that it rendered the proceedings unfair. Furthermore, any potential prejudice was offset by the trial justice’s general instructions that the parties’ closing arguments are not evidence.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

25,"E.W. Burman, Inc. : v. : Bradford Dyeing Association, Inc. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, E.W. Burman, Inc. (E.W. Burman or plaintiff), appeals from a Superior Court judgment entered in favor of the defendant, Bradford Dyeing Association, Inc. (Bradford Dyeing or defendant), following a bench trial in which the trial justice concluded that no oral or implied-in-fact contract existed between the parties. The trial justice also found that the defendant was not liable under the theories of quasi-contract or promissory estoppel. This case came before the Supreme Court on November 6, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In May 2007, a fire occurred at Bradford Dyeing’s facility in Westerly that caused significant structural damage. The defendant enlisted the help of Commonwealth Engineers', '-1- (Commonwealth) to assist in the restoration of its facilities. The restoration project consisted of two phases: Phase one required the installation of a temporary roof that would permit operations to continue, and phase two required the complete replacement of the roof. Phase two is the basis for this action.', 'Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual) insured defendant, contributed to the cost for the phase one repairs, and was expected to also contribute to phase two repairs. Liberty Mutual was therefore involved in communication with Commonwealth and defendant regarding the roof reconstruction designs for phase two. Commonwealth designed the new roof and promptly issued requests for bids. At the close of the bid deadline, plaintiff was the lowest bidder by approximately $400,000.', 'On August 27,1 a meeting was held between plaintiff’s president, Edward W. Burman, Jr. (Burman), two individuals from Commonwealth, and Charles Doherty from Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual had engaged the private engineering firm of Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger to verify the phase two designs and to determine whether plaintiff understood the scope of the roof project. A representative from that firm was also in attendance at that meeting. What occurred at that meeting is disputed, but, nevertheless, contract negotiations ensued shortly after. While negotiations continued, plaintiff incurred costs for drawings and materials for the roof restoration project. Ultimately, before any written contract had been signed, defendant decided to change its roof plans.', 'The plaintiff sent defendant an invoice for materials purchased based on the original roof design, and it sent a revised bid to Commonwealth with respect to the new roof design. In response, defendant, through its attorney, sent plaintiff a letter claiming that plaintiff was never authorized to purchase materials for the project. Subsequently, plaintiff filed a complaint against 1', 'All events in this case, unless otherwise designated, took place in 2007.', '-2- defendant in Washington County Superior Court alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied contract, and (3) that defendant was liable under the theory of quasi-contract. The plaintiff in 2011 filed an amended complaint that added the allegation that defendant was liable under the theory of promissory estoppel.', 'A bench trial before a justice of the Superior Court commenced on January 23, 2012. The trial lasted four days and concluded on January 26, 2012.', 'Three witnesses testified: Burman; Commonwealth’s corporate secretary and treasurer, Steven M. Clarke (Clarke); and Attorney Gerald Petros (Petros), who had been defendant’s outside legal counsel. Burman was the first witness to testify, and he recounted that plaintiff submitted a bid on the roof restoration project on August 17. On August 20, Bruce Bartel, Commonwealth’s project engineer for this project, contacted Burman and informed him that E.W. Burman was the low bidder. Burman testified that Bartel asked how soon they could start, and Burman told him they could start immediately. Burman testified that Bartel called him later in the week and said “that, again it looks like it’s a go project for us,” and that the final hurdle was meeting with Liberty Mutual because it would be paying for the project and wanted to know if plaintiff completely understood the scope of the work.', 'Burman testified that the scope meeting occurred on August 27. Present were Burman, Bartel and Clarke from Commonwealth, Charles Doherty from Liberty Mutual, and a representative from Liberty Mutual’s engineering firm. Burman testified that no employee or representative of defendant was present at the meeting. Burman testified that Bartel and Clarke told him at the meeting that plaintiff was the contractor on the project and that plaintiff and defendant “had an oral contract after [they] came out of that meeting.” He testified that he, Bartel, and Clarke discussed what form of contract they would use, and Burman offered to', '-3- “expedite things” and send over a form contract for review, which Burman did the same day. Burman testified that he submitted a final proposed schedule of construction and that neither Commonwealth nor Liberty Mutual objected to the schedule.', 'Burman testified that, based on the schedule he submitted and because “[t]ime was of the essence,” he, on behalf of plaintiff, authorized Reliable Truss and Components, Inc. to begin preparing shop drawings for the roof trusses and ordered $63,000 worth of stainless-steel angles and flat bars from Shawmut Metal (Shawmut), despite not having signed a written contract for the project. He testified that Commonwealth had agreed that the work had to start immediately in order to meet the end date of December 31 and that he was “never told [at] any time at that 27th meeting not to proceed with any of the work. It was full steam ahead.” Burman testified that his company commences work prior to having a written contract “all the time.”', 'Burman further testified that E.W. Burman’s project manager, Rich Hawes, sent an e-mail to Bartel on September 13 asking permission to visit the job site to take measurements. Burman testified that Bartel replied, including Burman and Clarke on the response, stating: “We have been directed by Bradford’s attorney to wait on any visits or other work activities until contract issues are worked out with the insurance company. So, wait on any site visits until there is a contractual relationship between Burman and Bradford Dye.” Burman testified that he interpreted Bartel’s e-mail to mean that something was going on between defendant and Liberty Mutual, but that he did not know what the issue was.', 'Burman testified that he responded to Bartel’s e-mail by telling him that no representative from plaintiff would visit the worksite. Burman further testified that, on September 17, he e-mailed Bartel asking if there had been “any movement on the legal end[,]” and emphasizing that plaintiff needed to get to the worksite to take measurements in order to comply with the', '-4- construction schedule. He testified that Bartel responded: “As there is no signed contract, all work done to date and until a contract is signed, is at your own risk.” Burman testified that he was confused by the e-mail and called Clarke, Bartel’s “boss,” who assured Burman that there was no problem with plaintiff’s contract and the issue was between defendant and Liberty Mutual. Burman testified that Clarke told him that, once that was resolved, they could get back to the job site.', 'Burman testified that, in September, Clarke had e-mailed him regarding the proposed written contract between plaintiff and defendant. He testified that Clarke informed him that “representatives from Liberty Mutual and Bradford Dye have reviewed the contract and have made some changes[,]” and that if Burman found them acceptable, he should execute four copies and bring them to Clarke’s office. Burman testified that he responded to Clarke with several questions regarding changes that had been made to the contract. He testified that a damages clause had been included, meaning that E.W. Burman would have to pay the owner damages in the event that the work was not completed on schedule. Burman testified that he responded to Clarke immediately with a counterproposal asking for an incentive payment if plaintiff completed the project early. He testified that Clarke did not reply until October 24, when he responded with “a whole new document[.]” Burman testified that, during that time period, E.W. Burman was “on hold[,]” which “completely threw that [construction] schedule off.”', 'Burman additionally testified that plaintiff was eventually cleared to visit the job site and take measurements, which occurred on October 25. Burman testified that, on October 29, plaintiff authorized Shawmut to start cutting materials for the project and signed a purchase order with Tri-State Fasteners, Inc. to supply all the bolts, nuts, washers, and screws for the project. Burman testified that, on November 5, the parties had reached agreement on all terms in the', '-5- contract, except for a possible price change for demolition work that Bradford Dyeing had performed itself while negotiations had stalled. Burman testified that the demolition issue was never resolved.', 'Burman testified, however, that on November 12, he received an e-mail from Clarke indicating that defendant was changing the plans for the new roof. Burman testified that he received the revised plans from Commonwealth and spoke with Clarke about the materials that had already been purchased by plaintiff. He testified that Clarke told him to incorporate as many of the purchased materials as he could into the revised project price.', 'Burman testified that he sent defendant an invoice on November 30 for the purchased materials and subsequently sent defendant a bid for the new project on December 10. Burman testified that he was anxiously waiting to hear something from defendant, but heard nothing through the end of December regarding the invoice or the new scope of work. Burman testified that he eventually called Craig Nichols, head of manufacturing operations for Bradford Dyeing, who told Burman that they were undecided about the new scope of work for the revised project. Burman testified that, when he asked about the invoice, Nichols basically told him “we didn’t have any contract, we don’t owe you any money[.]”', 'On cross-examination, Burman conceded that he wanted to eventually have a written contract and that there was a mutual expectation between plaintiff and defendant that there would be one. He further conceded that he and defendant exchanged different versions of written contracts between August and November and that obtaining a written contract remained a goal of his up until November 7. Burman testified that, in the majority of cases, his firm does not engage in fieldwork prior to having a written contract and that the majority of construction projects entail one. Burman conceded that he was familiar with the written document called an', '-6- “Official Notice to Proceed,” which is generally given from an owner to a contractor indicating that the contractor can proceed with a project whether or not there is a written contract between the parties and that he did not have such a notice in this case. Burman testified that he placed orders for parts with three different companies, but he never specifically received permission from defendant to order those parts. He further conceded that he ordered those parts to ensure that they would be on the job site when he needed them, but that he did not perform other tasks that did not involve placing orders, despite claiming that “time was of the essence[.]”', 'Next, Clarke testified and recounted a contrary version of events. Clarke testified that he did not attend the scope meeting on August 27, but that Bartel did. Clarke testified that he never authorized plaintiff to order materials, but that he never prohibited plaintiff from doing so either. He testified that, when the project stalled in September, Commonwealth made it clear to Burman that he should not take field measurements or order any materials. Clarke testified that Bartel’s September 17 e-mail to Burman meant that “all work done to date” was at E.W. Burman’s own risk and “materials would be included in part of that.” Clarke testified that he did not tell Burman, during their October 23 phone call, that the project was “a go.”', 'Clarke testified that he never had authority to bind Bradford Dyeing to a contract, was never given authority by defendant to bind the company into a contract with plaintiff, and never indicated to any representative of plaintiff that plaintiff had a contract with defendant. He further testified that he never participated substantively in any contract discussions between plaintiff and defendant and only acted as a “facilitator” who “sent [the contract] up to the owner and legal entities.” Clarke testified that he never received a phone call from Burman on September 17. He testified that he did speak with Burman on October 23 to inform him that the issues between', '-7- defendant and Liberty Mutual had been worked out and mentioned that the contract would be forthcoming.', 'The last witness to testify was Petros, who corroborated Clarke’s testimony. Petros testified that he was “quarterbacking” the reconstruction process on defendant’s behalf, and that he communicated with plaintiff through Commonwealth—specifically, Clarke.', 'He further testified that he had no knowledge of the August 27 scope meeting with plaintiff, Liberty Mutual, and Commonwealth, but he knew that no contract would be signed or awarded that day. Petros additionally testified that a contract was in fact never signed with E.W. Burman, he never had any discussions with Burman, and he did not recall sending any communication to E.W. Burman.', 'Petros testified that he was aware that a written contract had been passed back and forth between plaintiff and defendant, but that defendant’s discussions with Liberty Mutual did not progress fast enough to conclude negotiations with plaintiff. He testified that, at a certain point during negotiations, he held onto the contract and conveyed to plaintiff, through Commonwealth, that defendant was having discussions with Liberty Mutual during that time. Petros further testified that defendant needed to finish the contract before giving plaintiff the “green light” on the project, and denied that he gave Clarke permission to authorize Burman to proceed. He testified that defendant intended to have a written contract with plaintiff and that the parties worked towards one, but mutually agreeable terms were never reached.', '-8-', 'Both parties submitted posttrial memoranda; and, on June 21, 2018, the trial justice issued a comprehensive written decision.2 The trial justice found that the parties were actively engaged in negotiations regarding the terms of the contract as late as November 6 and that, at or about that time, defendant and Liberty Mutual reached agreement on the amount of insurance coverage for the fire loss. She further found that, based on the amount of financial contribution from Liberty Mutual, defendant selected a different roof design, which was simpler and more cost-effective, and thereafter notified plaintiff of that change. The trial justice found that, instead of asserting that it had an oral contract at that time, plaintiff submitted a new bid for the revised project, and plaintiff asserted that the parties had an enforceable oral agreement only after plaintiff found out that it was not the low bidder on the revised project.', 'The trial justice summarized the testimony and found both witnesses for defendant to be credible. The trial justice stated that Clarke’s testimony was “straightforward and worthy of belief[,]” while Petros “presented as a credible witness” who provided “no reason to doubt the veracity of his testimony.” Based on their testimony, the trial justice found that Clarke never expressly authorized plaintiff to purchase materials for the project and that Burman was expressly told not to send his employees to the job site. The trial justice further found that Clarke was “steadfast in his testimony that he was never authorized to bind [d]efendant to an agreement with [p]laintiff, and that it was never his intent to enter into an agreement on [d]efendant’s behalf.” The trial justice explained that Clarke served as an intermediary between the parties and that he forwarded each version of the proposed written contract to plaintiff for execution, but that the draft contract was rejected and counteroffers were made. She further 2', 'The trial justice filed her written decision approximately six years after the parties filed their posttrial memoranda. We have not been apprised of an adequate explanation for the long and unreasonable delay in this case. Such a delay is not only concerning, but is also discouraged, as every effort should be made to decide cases as expeditiously and efficiently as possible.', '-9- found that defendant informed plaintiff about the changes to the roof design as soon as defendant and Liberty Mutual came to terms about the extent of insurance coverage for the repairs; however, until terms were reached, defendant felt it was unwise to cancel the existing plan it had been negotiating with plaintiff.', 'To the contrary, the trial justice found Burman’s testimony to be “self-serving and lacking in credibility.” She recalled that Burman testified that he believed Bartel’s September 13 e-mail to be an error and that the contractual relationship referenced in the second paragraph was supposed to be the one between defendant and Liberty Mutual. The trial justice found Burman’s belief to be unreasonable, especially because plaintiff’s own contract negotiations with defendant had stalled. The trial justice further found that Burman was well aware that plaintiff had no signed contract with defendant in September, which rendered Bartel’s September 17 directive “all that more clear: ‘all work done to date and until a contract is signed, is at your own risk.’” (Emphasis added by trial justice.) The trial justice stated that it was disingenuous for Burman to assert that the parties were bound by an oral agreement formed at the August 27 scope meeting, at which defendant was not present, despite the “significant efforts in negotiating the construction contract with the [d]efendant through early November[.]”', 'On the question of whether an oral contract existed, the trial justice found that it was “abundantly clear that [d]efendant, the party sought to be charged, at all times intended that a written agreement be executed between the parties.” The trial justice also explained that, based on Burman’s own actions, plaintiff also intended to be bound by a written agreement. The trial justice recounted the continued negotiations between the parties and noted various offers and counteroffers—specifically plaintiff’s objection to the insertion of a liquidated-damages clause and plaintiff’s counteroffer to accept the liquidated-damages clause if matched by an incentive', '- 10 - payment clause. Importantly, she noted that defendant did not respond to or indicate approval of those changes.', 'Further, the trial justice reviewed Burman’s claim that, on October 23, Clarke informed him that the project was “ready to go[,]” and “that this statement somehow meant that he no longer needed to concern himself” with the ongoing contract negotiations. The trial justice found this assertion not credible, especially given that Clarke sent Burman “an entirely new version of the form contract” on October 24. She explained that Burman responded to that new version with changes, specifically a certificate-of-occupancy issue, removal of a provision making plaintiff liable for snow removal, reimbursement for temporary heating on site, and plaintiff’s desire to halve the excess-liability insurance requirement from $10 million to $5 million and reduce its deductible in case of loss from $20,000 to $1,000.', 'The trial justice also considered the particular industry, noting that Burman testified that large construction projects sometimes proceed without a written contract, but also that not all organizations he had worked with allow construction to proceed without a written contract in place. The trial justice found that defendant clearly seemed opposed to permitting plaintiff to begin construction without a written contract in place.', 'The trial justice described that no past practices existed between these parties that would justify proceeding without a signed contract.', 'The trial justice ultimately found that defendant at all times anticipated its relationship with plaintiff to be governed by a written contract, defendant made it abundantly clear that plaintiff was not to perform any work without a written contract in place, and plaintiff “chose to ignore that directive and did so at its own peril.” The trial justice concluded that no oral or implied-in-fact contract existed between the parties.

Each party must have and manifest an objective intent to be bound by the agreement.” Opella v. Opella, 896 A.2d 714, 720 (R.I. 2006). “For either an express or implied contract, ‘a litigant must prove mutual assent or a meeting of the minds between the parties.’” Id. (quoting Mills v.

Specifically, plaintiff notes two instances in the trial justice’s decision in which she mentioned that no employee or representative from defendant was at the scope meeting; and plaintiff argues that, to the extent the trial justice was influenced by this fact, she misapplied the law. The plaintiff then claims that the trial justice made the wrong factual findings that Commonwealth acted as an intermediary between the parties and not as an agent of defendant with actual or apparent authority to bind defendant. In essence, plaintiff asks this Court to make a different factual finding, which would in turn require a different application of law that would inure to plaintiff’s benefit.', 'However, our review of the trial justice’s decision and the entire record of the case leads us to a contrary conclusion. Clarke testified that he was never given authority to bind defendant to a contract, never indicated to plaintiff that plaintiff had a contract with defendant, and never participated substantively in any contractual issue between plaintiff and defendant.', 'Clarke testified that he merely passed the contract back and forth between the parties, serving as exactly', '- 14 - what the trial justice deemed him to be, an intermediary. Importantly, in her decision, the trial justice noted that Clarke’s testimony was “straightforward and worthy of belief.” Accordingly, we conclude that competent evidence exists within the record to support the trial justice’s finding that Clarke served as an intermediary between the parties, and we will not disturb her credibility determinations. See Cote, 148 A.3d at 544. We therefore conclude that the trial justice did not misapply the law by relying on the fact that no employee or representative of defendant was present at the August 27 scope meeting.', 'Next, plaintiff alleges that the trial justice misapplied the law when she determined that there was a fundamental inconsistency between plaintiff’s position that it had reached a binding oral agreement with defendant at the August 27 scope meeting, but fully intended to eventually enter into a written contract with defendant. The plaintiff parses two sentences in the trial justice’s decision to support its assertion. First is where she found “that both parties intended to enter into a written instrument but failed to do so; thus, they cannot be bound to an oral contract.” Second is where she noted that it was “disingenuous” for plaintiff to claim the existence of a binding oral contract on August 27, despite such extensive negotiations that occurred from August throughout November. After careful review of the trial justice’s decision, we discern no such error.', 'An examination of the trial justice’s decision reveals that she found it abundantly clear that neither defendant nor plaintiff had “manifested an objective intent to be bound before signing the written” contract. Smith, 553 A.2d at 134. She concluded that because defendant objectively intended to be bound by a written contract, along with plaintiff, that defendant could not be bound to an oral contract in this case, not that such a scenario could not exist—e.g., where a party does manifest an objective intent to be bound before signing the written instrument.', '- 15 - Additionally, when commenting on Burman’s testimony, the trial justice noted her disbelief by stating that it was “disingenuous” for Burman to assert that the parties intended to be bound by an oral contract on August 27, despite such extensive subsequent negotiations that demonstrated the opposite intention.', 'This was not a misapplication of law, but, instead, it was a characterization of Burman’s credibility by the trial justice. We conclude that this does not demonstrate a “fundamental inconsistency” with basic contract law principles, but rather a straightforward application of this Court’s contract jurisprudence.', 'The plaintiff makes several additional contentions, arguing that the trial justice erred when she (1) failed to appreciate the emergency conditions of the contract; (2) overlooked extensive evidence of substantial performance by plaintiff that indicated the parties’ objective intent to be bound by the purported oral agreement; (3) relied upon Bartel’s September 17 e-mail to refute the existence of an oral agreement and found that such e-mail directed plaintiff not to perform any work until a written contract was signed; (4) found that Burman “claimed” he no longer needed to finalize a written contract with defendant after being given the “green light” on the project; and (5) concluded that plaintiff’s failure to assert the existence of an oral contract until late December refuted its claim to the existence of such a contract.', 'Our careful review of the trial justice’s decision, the exhibits, and the entire record of this case lead us to the conclusion that the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence with regard to these contentions. The trial justice issued a comprehensive written decision that addressed the credibility of the witnesses, made findings of fact, and concluded that the parties did not intend to be bound by an oral contract. Although she did not mention every piece of evidence in her written decision, it is clear she considered and weighed such evidence in coming to her conclusion.

Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 147 (R.I. 2008)).', 'The trial justice correctly articulated the law as enunciated by this Court. She found that Burman forwarded a written contract to defendant shortly after the August 27 scope meeting and she emphasized that the purpose of that meeting was to ensure that plaintiff grasped the extent of the roof project. She described the extensive negotiations between the parties from the time of the scope meeting until early November, which included significant changes to the contract and disputes regarding a liquidated-damages clause and the final price.', 'The trial justice noted Bartel’s September 13 e-mail that directed plaintiff to “wait on any site visits until there is a contractual relationship between [E.W.] Burman and Bradford Dye[,]” and his September 17 e-mail that reminded plaintiff that “[a]s there is no signed contract, all work done to date and until a contract is signed, is at your own risk.” The trial justice’s decision indicates that she rejected the evidence plaintiff submitted in support of its argument that the e-mail was confusing and that Clarke assured Burman that there was no problem with plaintiff’s contract. The trial justice found that Burman was “well aware that [p]laintiff had no signed contract with [d]efendant in September 2007,” and that that fact made the directive “all that more clear: ‘all work done to date and until a contract is signed, is at your own risk.’”', 'Moreover, the trial justice drew the reasonable inference from this finding that defendant did not want plaintiff to incur costs in connection with the project, and, if it did so, it was at its own risk. Although Burman never specifically “claimed” that he no longer needed to finalize a written contract with defendant after being given the “green light” on the project, the trial justice', '- 17 - drew the reasonable inference that Burman’s actions indicated that he believed it to be so. Similarly, she drew the inference that, had an oral contract existed on August 27, plaintiff would have asserted its rights under that oral contract well before the time it did. Especially in light of being told to “wait on any site visits until there is a contractual relationship between [E.W.] Burman and Bradford Dye” and “[a]s there is no signed contract, all work done to date and until a contract is signed, is at your own risk.”', 'Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial justice’s findings that no oral contract existed between the parties.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

However, he was twice held in contempt of court because of persistent misconduct in the courtroom, and a mistrial was declared. The defendant’s new (and last) trial was held in 1988, and he was found guilty again of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to sixty years’ imprisonment, with fifty years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. The defendant also received an additional sentence of twenty years to serve as a habitual offender, which, importantly and as expected, was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence for second-degree murder. The habitual offender sentence was to be nonparolable for the first eighteen years of the sentence. This Court affirmed defendant’s conviction in 1992. State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1119 (R.I. 1992). The record before us establishes that the judgment of conviction for the crime of murder, which was designated in the judgment as “count 1,” was incorrect because the sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed as a habitual offender.', 'Although defendant has challenged his conviction and imprisonment regularly, appearing before the Superior Court and this Court on numerous occasions since 1992, the erroneous judgment of conviction was not discovered until almost three decades after it was entered.4 Significantly, Mattatall’s first appearance before the parole board was originally scheduled in 2001―after he served precisely eighteen years’ imprisonment, but the hearing actually occurred in 2002.5 In 2002, parole was denied for multiple reasons, including defendant’s disciplinary record at the Adult Correctional Institutions.

At that point, defendant had been incarcerated for more than thirty-two years. However, the minutes from that parole board hearing reflect uncertainty concerning whether defendant was eligible for release or whether he was to be paroled to begin serving the nonparolable eighteen-year habitual offender sentence. The parole board concluded that, if defendant’s eligibility had not been calculated in the aggregate, then defendant would be paroled to his consecutive sentence as a habitual offender in August 2015. However, the parole board also decided that, if it was determined that his eligibility had been calculated in the aggregate and he therefore no longer had consecutive time to serve, then he would be paroled in January 2016 to a residential substance-abuse treatment program.', 'In October 2015, the parole board chairperson, by letter to defendant, informed him that the parole decision would be applied to the sentence for the murder conviction and that he was paroled to the consecutive nonparolable sentence as a habitual offender, a sentence over which the parole board did not have jurisdiction. Therefore, after serving thirty-two years of a fifty- year sentence for second-degree murder, defendant was paroled to the habitual offender sentence, and will serve a total of at least fifty years in prison.', 'In 2016, defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as an application for postconviction relief.

Both the application and the Rule 35 motion were denied.6', 'In the Superior Court, Mattatall conceded that the sentence imposed in 1988 was not an illegal sentence under Rule 35(a), but that the error arose from the manner in which the sentence was executed. The defendant contended that the oral pronouncement of the sentence reflected that the habitual offender sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence for the murder conviction. Thus, under the law in effect at the time, G.L. 1956 § 13-8-13, he was eligible to appear before the parole board in 1993, after ten years’ imprisonment. But it was not until 2001 that he was first deemed eligible to appear before the parole board—after the precise length of the nonparolable sentence, which was eighteen years.', 'Unquestionably, in 1988, the trial justice sentenced defendant to sixty years at the ACI for second-degree murder, with fifty years to serve.', 'He also sentenced defendant to a consecutive term of twenty years’ imprisonment and ordered that eighteen years of that sentence was nonparolable. There is no dispute that the trial justice orally ordered that the habitual offender sentence be served consecutively to the sentence for the murder conviction. However, the written judgment for the murder conviction directs that the sentence is “to run consecutive to habitual offender sentence[,]” and the judgment for the habitual offender sentence mandates that sentence “[t]o run consecutive with count 1.”', 'Although defendant conceded before the trial justice that the sentence was not an illegal sentence under Rule 35, he argued that its execution was illegal and constituted a violation of his due-process rights because it deprived him of his right to appear before the parole board for eighteen years, which was eight years longer than § 13-8-13 provided.7 The defendant correctly 6', 'The trial justice’s denial of defendant’s application for postconviction relief is not before the Court in this present appeal. 7', 'Although defendant acknowledged before the trial justice that he was denied parole in 2002', '-5- argues that the judgment of conviction contains an error because it specifically recites that the sentence for murder shall “run consecutive to the habitual offender sentence.”', 'The state argued that the trial justice did not have the authority to adjust defendant’s parole eligibility because, even if the Department of Corrections improperly calculated his parole eligibility, this error did not render the sentence illegal for Rule 35 purposes.8 The state also argued that there was no prejudice from defendant seeing the parole board after eighteen years rather than ten years, because the reasons for the board ultimately denying parole were not related to defendant’s conduct at the ACI.', 'Despite the quandary created by the error in the judgment and the erroneous calculation of defendant’s parole-eligibility date, the trial justice was careful not to “play Super Parole Board” in making his decision. He found that the sentence being served by defendant―as a habitual offender―was a nonparolable term that could not be altered unless the trial justice first found that it was an illegal sentence. Because, as the parties agreed, defendant’s sentence was not an illegal sentence under Rule 35, the trial justice concluded that it was not subject to correction. However, the trial justice was “nonetheless troubled by the circumstances” presented by defendant’s situation. The trial justice denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief and his Rule 35 motion, ruling in favor of the state. Before this Court in this appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his Rule 35 motion. partly because of his institutional record, he contends that he was prejudiced because, had he appeared before the parole board eight years earlier, he would have received the rehabilitative direction from the parole board that triggered his eventual turnaround in behavior which led to his eventual parole. According to defendant, it was his initial appearance before the parole board in 2002 that gave rise to the realization that he could one day be released on parole. 8', 'The state also argued harmless error and asserted that the reasons for the denial of his parole after the initial 2002 appearance indicated that, had defendant seen the parole board eight years earlier, he might not have been released.', '-6-', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court follows a “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters.” State v.

Prison is where convicted murderers are sent; an unauthorized form of punishment for an offense such as this in this state would be the death penalty or a public flogging, for instance.', 'On the other hand, the state argues that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s Rule 35 motion for several reasons, including that the motion was “procedurally infirm” because defendant was not seeking to correct an illegal sentence within the meaning of Rule 35(a). Instead, as defendant conceded before the trial justice, he was challenging the execution of his sentence, not its legality. Additionally, the state argues that any correction to the judgment would not alter Mattatall’s current parole-eligibility date. According to the state, notwithstanding', '-7- the erroneous calculation of the date when Mattatall became eligible to apply for parole, he was eventually afforded the opportunity to appear. According to the state, Mattatall has failed to establish any prejudice from this delay. We decline to engage in this speculation, and we confine our analysis to the record.', 'We observe that, once defendant began the parole process, the reasons for which the parole board denied parole are in line with the board’s standards for evaluating parole applications in accordance with § 13-8-14.1, and accurately mirror the statutory release criteria set forth in § 13-8-14, the first of which is a prisoner’s institutional disciplinary record. The other factors include the seriousness of the offender’s crime and whether release would “depreciate the seriousness of the prisoner’s offense or promote disrespect for the law[.]” Section 13-8-14(a)(2). The reasons for denying Mattatall’s parole application clearly relate to the murder conviction, for which release on parole was granted in 2016. At that point, Mattatall had been incarcerated for thirty-two years and faced another eighteen years without parole. The minutes of his last appearance before the board on July 13, 2015, indicate that the board was “uncertain if Mr. Mattatall’s parole eligibility on his two sentences has been calculated in the aggregate.” However, the board decided that, if Mattatall “no longer has consecutive time to serve, then the [b]oard votes to parole Mr. Mattatall in January 2016 to [a] residential substance abuse treatment program[.]” Thus, as of July 2015, the parole board was of the opinion that his release on parole was appropriate. However, Mattatall faced either another six months in prison or an additional eighteen years.', 'This Court’s jurisprudence recognizes a difference between illegal sentences under Rule 35 and clerical mistakes in judgments under Rule 36. Relief under either rule is not available to this defendant. First, as he conceded in Superior Court, the trial justice did not', '-8- impose an illegal sentence. As the Reporter’s Notes to Rule 35(a) provide, “an ‘illegal sentence’ is one which has been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under law.” This would include a sentence in excess of that provided by law or an unauthorized form of punishment, such as the death penalty. Unfortunately, the clerical mistake in the judgment of conviction was not discovered until defendant had served thirty-two years, and may have resulted in adverse consequences.', 'The trial justice was not without sympathy. He agreed that “somebody dropped the ball” and that Mattatall “was not seen by the [p]arole [b]oard when he lawfully was entitled to see the [p]arole [b]oard.” The state did not disagree that Mattatall’s parole eligibility was improperly calculated. However, the trial justice also recognized that defendant currently was serving a nonparolable term of imprisonment over which the parole board had no authority. He also correctly acknowledged that, in the context of this case, the law does not permit the court to alter the sentence without a finding that it was illegal. The trial justice pointed that out, and added: “But I am nonetheless troubled by the circumstances.”', 'Neither the trial justice nor this Court can turn back time, nor can we speculate, one way or the other, on what the parole board would have done had Mattatall timely appeared before the board after he had served ten years of the sentence for second-degree murder. This unfortunate circumstance cannot be corrected. We deem it appropriate, however, to exercise our supervisory jurisdiction and afford defendant an opportunity to seek relief from the trial justice who has patiently presided over this case for three decades. We fully recognize that “the exercise of our supervisory jurisdiction is an extraordinary measure.” State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1166 (R.I. 2011) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980)). However, “this Court under its general supervisory powers can exercise its inherent power to', '-9- fashion an appropriate remedy to serve the ends of justice.” Bates-Bridgmon v.

We hold that, based upon the dilemma wrought by the erroneous judgment in this case, the defendant may, within 120 days of the issuance of this opinion, file a motion to reduce the sentence imposed as a habitual criminal in accordance with Rule 35 and the general laws, or a motion to reduce the nonparolable portion of the sentence. See State v. O’Rourke, 463 A.2d 1328, 1331 (R.I. 1983) (noting that, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19-10, the Superior Court’s authority to reduce a sentence under Rule 35 is limited to shortening the period of imprisonment while not suspending any portion of a sentence the offender has commenced serving).', 'We hasten to add that, although we deem this opportunity to seek a reduction in sentence fully warranted under the circumstances before us, we are careful to make clear that our decision applies to this case and this case only.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this case to the Superior Court.', '- 10 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

27,Edward F. St. Onge : v. : USAA Federal Savings Bank et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Edward St. Onge, appeals pro se from the dismissal of his claims against the defendants, USAA Federal Savings Bank (USAA) and Charles Baird (Baird), for lack of personal jurisdiction. This case came before the Supreme Court on November 6, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the orders of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This dispute arose from an alleged oral agreement between plaintiff and Baird, with whom plaintiff was a long-time friend. The plaintiff is a resident of Rhode Island, and Baird is a resident of Florida. According to the complaint, Baird sought plaintiff’s help resolving a will dispute in Florida. In the disputed will, which was handwritten, Baird was named sole beneficiary. The plaintiff alleged that, after Baird’s repeated requests for his assistance, he', '-1- finally contracted with Baird on or about April 15, 2015, to perform certain consulting and other services regarding the will dispute.1 In return for his services, plaintiff alleged, he would be reimbursed by Baird for expenses that plaintiff advanced and the fair market value of his services, should Baird prevail; plaintiff would earn nothing if Baird did not prevail.', 'From mid-April 2015 until May 31, 2016, plaintiff alleged, he performed “numerous services” for Baird, which included traveling to and from Florida, at plaintiff’s own expense. The plaintiff asserts that he assisted Baird in “interview[ing], select[ing], secur[ing,] and oversee[ing] legal services from a Florida attorney.”', 'After assisting Baird in securing an attorney, plaintiff continued to work with Baird, he alleged, “to help him successfully prevail in the [w]ill contest as well as inventorying and evaluating claims of alleged creditors and negotiating favorable settlement of numerous outstanding debts of the [inherited] Estate.” The plaintiff alleged that he performed the work for Baird in both Rhode Island and Florida, always traveling at plaintiff’s own expense.', 'After prevailing in the will dispute, and after the creditors’ window of time to file claims against the estate had expired, Baird transferred $40,000 from the estate to his personal checking account at USAA. USAA is a bank that is incorporated in Texas and based in San Antonio. The plaintiff alleges that the bulk of that money, by agreement of Baird, was to be paid to plaintiff for his services and, at Baird’s direction, plaintiff was authorized to pay an agreed-upon total of $25,355.67 from Baird’s USAA account to plaintiff’s credit-card accounts directly. Thereafter, the funds were paid to five different national credit-card accounts belonging to plaintiff. However, on June 28, 2016, USAA rescinded all the credit-card payments, without notice to 1', 'The plaintiff had previously worked as an attorney, but he was not practicing at the time Baird’s will dispute arose. The plaintiff was suspended from the practice of law in 2008 for a period of eighteen months, by order of this Court. In re St. Onge, 958 A.2d 143, 146 (R.I. 2008) (mem.). He has not sought reinstatement.', '-2- plaintiff. Additionally, plaintiff alleges that Baird executed a check from his USAA account to plaintiff in the amount of $9,644.33 and that the check was returned and marked “Not Authorized.”', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court on September 7, 2016, against both Baird and USAA, seeking to recover the rescinded funds plus interest, costs, and consequential damages. Baird filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.', 'An order granting the motion was entered on January 28, 2017.2', 'A default judgment was entered against USAA for failing to defend against the action but was later vacated on the ground that the Superior Court lacked personal jurisdiction over USAA. USAA then moved to dismiss the claim against it for lack of personal jurisdiction, which was granted. That order was entered on June 29, 2018. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on July 17, 2018.3 2', 'The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the order dismissing his claims against Baird for lack of personal jurisdiction on March 17, 2017. The case was referred to the full Court sitting in conference for possible disposition without further briefing, in accordance with Article I, Rule 12A(3)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. There, we determined in May 2018 that plaintiff’s appeal was not properly before this Court because the action against USAA remained pending. “In order to perfect an appeal from a multiparty suit, there must be entry of final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.” Catone v. Multimedia Concepts, Inc., 483 A.2d 1081, 1082 (R.I. 1984). We thereafter remanded the case to the Superior Court, where the remaining claim against USAA was resolved, and this appeal followed. 3', 'The plaintiff’s July 17, 2018 notice of appeal identifies only the June 29, 2018 order dismissing claims against USAA as the “judgment or order” appealed from. Although the January 28, 2017 order dismissing claims against Baird for lack of jurisdiction was not listed on the notice of appeal, we nevertheless consider the arguments regarding that order on appeal, because the June 29, 2018 order was a final order and therefore encompassed all prior interlocutory orders. See Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 291 (R.I. 2007) (holding that a notice of appeal that referred only to the final order was sufficient to support review of earlier orders, especially in light of an earlier unsuccessful attempt to take a premature appeal from that order); State v. Piedmont Funding Corporation, 121 R.I. 27, 29, 394 A.2d 694, 695 (1978) (holding that a “final judgment or order for purposes of appealability is one that terminates all the litigation arising out of the action between the parties on the merits”).', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a challenge to personal jurisdiction, “[w]e examine the pleadings, accept the facts alleged by the plaintiff as true, and view disputed facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.” Cassidy v. Lonquist Management Co., LLC, 920 A.2d 228, 232 (R.I. 2007). The question of personal jurisdiction presents a “mixed question[] of law and fact[.]” Hawes v. Reilly, 184 A.3d 661, 665 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 232). While mixed questions of law and fact usually require more deferential treatment to the trial justice’s findings of fact, “when deciding mixed questions of law and fact that involve constitutional issues, our review is de novo.” Id. (quoting Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 232). We therefore review a challenge to personal jurisdiction de novo. See, e.g., id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Jurisdiction Over USAA', 'The issue before us is whether plaintiff has alleged “‘sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of jurisdiction,’ in order to overcome [USAA’s] motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.” Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 231-32 (quoting Cerberus Partners, L.P. v. Gadsby & Hannah, LLP, 836 A.2d 1113, 1118 (R.I. 2003)). In reviewing the record, we accept the facts alleged by plaintiff as true and view disputed facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Id. at 232.', '“To establish a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction in Rhode Island, a plaintiff’s allegations must satisfy the demands of Rhode Island’s long-arm statute, [G.L. 1956] § 9-5-33.”', '-4- Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 232. That statute provides that “[e]very foreign corporation * * * that shall have the necessary minimum contacts with the state of Rhode Island, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Rhode Island * * * in every case not contrary to the provisions of the constitution or laws of the United States.” Section 9-5-33(a).', '“This language has been interpreted to mean that Rhode Island courts may exercise jurisdiction over foreign defendants within the parameters set forth by the United States Constitution.” McKenney v. Kenyon Piece Dye Works, Inc., 582 A.2d 107, 108 (R.I. 1990).', 'The forum court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant when either general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction is alleged and proven by the plaintiff. See Hawes, 184 A.3d at 670. In the present case, plaintiff asserts that the Superior Court has both general and specific jurisdiction over USAA.', '1', 'General Jurisdiction', 'We begin by addressing plaintiff’s argument with regard to general jurisdiction over USAA. In Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014), the United States Supreme Court established that a court has general jurisdiction over a corporation in the state in which it is incorporated, where it has its principal place of business, and where the “corporation’s ‘affiliations with the [s]tate are so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the forum [s]tate.’” Daimler, 571 U.S. at 139 (emphasis added) (brackets omitted) (quoting Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011)). Where a court has general jurisdiction over a defendant, it may hear any claim involving that defendant, regardless of whether or not the claim arose out of the defendant’s contacts with the forum state. Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 233.', '-5-', 'The plaintiff asserts that USAA is “at home” in Rhode Island, and that the Superior Court has general jurisdiction over USAA because of “sweeping changes” that he alleges have occurred in the banking industry after Daimler was published in 2014, which changes, according to plaintiff, would allow for a Rhode Island court to have general jurisdiction over USAA. Specifically, he points to direct-deposit and online banking services, as well as advertising by USAA in Rhode Island, to support this contention. He further argues that “USAA is at least as much ‘at home’ in Rhode Island as it is in any other [s]tate, excepting Texas.”', 'This approach, however, ignores the developing body of law created by Daimler that general jurisdiction will be exercised only where a defendant is “at home” in the forum state, either through incorporation, principal place of business, or, in rare circumstances, where the defendant is “essentially at home.” Daimler, 571 U.S. at 139; see, e.g., BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrrell, 137 S. Ct. 1549, 1558 (2017); Waite v. AII Acquisition Corp., 901 F.3d 1307, 1317 (11th Cir. 2018); Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 626 (2nd Cir. 2016). Here, USAA is incorporated in Texas. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that USAA has its “corporate headquarters” in Texas, an allegation that is confirmed by USAA’s statement submitted to this Court pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Clearly, personal jurisdiction does not exist under the first two principles, because USAA is not incorporated in Rhode Island, nor is its principal place of business located in the state. See Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137.', 'Regarding the third principle, “essentially at home[,]” Daimler stands for the proposition that this is a high standard of limited applicability. See Daimler, 571 U.S. at 133 n.11 (concluding that “essentially at home” means “comparable to a domestic enterprise in that [s]tate”). We decline to hold that mere advertising and online banking options in this state rise to', '-6- the level of being “essentially at home” here, even in viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff. The plaintiff’s argument misinterprets the Supreme Court’s explanation of “essentially at home.”', 'In Daimler, the Supreme Court eliminated the previous general jurisdiction analysis, which required the forum court to review a corporation’s contacts in the forum state, and instead required the forum court to review the corporation’s affiliations with the forum state in order to determine whether there is general jurisdiction. Id. at 138-39. While the Supreme Court did not explicitly define the word affiliations, we hold that the level of affiliation must be comparable to that of a principal place of business or incorporation in order to render the corporation “essentially at home.” Id. at 139. The plaintiff’s factual allegations in this case do not indicate to us that USAA has sufficient affiliations with Rhode Island to consider USAA at home in the state.', 'Furthermore, plaintiff’s argument that “USAA is at least as much ‘at home’ in Rhode Island as it is in any other [s]tate, excepting Texas” cuts directly against the policy behind Daimler, which is to minimize subjecting corporations to general jurisdiction in every state in the country. See Daimler, 571 U.S. at 139, 139-40 n.20 (noting that “[a] corporation that operates in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them. Otherwise, ‘at home’ would be synonymous with ‘doing business’ tests framed before specific jurisdiction evolved”). To say that USAA is “at home” in every state indicates to us that a Rhode Island court does not have general jurisdiction over USAA, because USAA’s affiliations with the State of Rhode Island are the same as its affiliations with “every state in the country.” This clearly does not rise to the level of USAA being “at home” in Rhode Island. See Daimler, 571 U.S. at 139.', 'As such, we conclude that the Superior Court was correct in finding that it did not have general personal jurisdiction over USAA.', '-7-', '2', 'Specific Jurisdiction', 'Next, plaintiff alleges that, even if the Superior Court did not have general jurisdiction over USAA, it had specific jurisdiction.', 'The determination of whether there is specific jurisdiction over the defendant requires a two-step inquiry: (1) determining whether there are sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state; and (2) determining that litigation in the forum state does not “offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Rose v. Firstar Bank, 819 A.2d 1247, 1250 (R.I. 2003) (quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).', 'A party makes a successful prima facie showing of specific jurisdiction over a defendant where “the claim sufficiently relates to or arises from any of a defendant’s purposeful contacts with the forum.” Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 233 (quoting Rose, 819 A.2d at 1251). The defendant must have “performed ‘some act by which it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Rose, 819 A.2d at 1251). In reviewing defendant’s contacts with the forum, this Court looks to the “quality and quantity” of the contacts. Rose, 819 A.2d at 1250 (quoting Phillips Exeter Academy v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir. 1999)). “When there is no such connection [to the forum state], specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant’s unconnected activities in the [s]tate.” Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County, 137 S. Ct. 1773, 1781 (2017).', 'The plaintiff alleges that “[s]ince USAA’s contacts with Rhode Island don’t need to be ‘terribly robust’ * * * specific personal jurisdiction, is met rather easily.” The plaintiff asserts', '-8- that USAA maintains automatic teller machines in Rhode Island and that he has “personally seen their * * * cars registered, roaming billboards roaming around the state, and * * * seen their advertisements on the internet and on television[.]” The plaintiff ultimately alleges that “USAA became subject to personal jurisdiction in Rhode Island * * * when it looted funds of plaintiff, a Rhode Island resident, from his credit card accounts established and maintained, paid and used from Rhode Island.” The only relevant contacts alleged by plaintiff were actions performed by USAA at the direction of Baird: the rescission of credit-card payments and the returned “Not Authorized” check. See Bristol-Myers Squibb, 137 S. Ct. at 1781 (recognizing that “[i]n order for a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim, there must be an ‘affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, an activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum [s]tate’” (brackets omitted) (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919)).', 'In Cassidy, however, we concluded that the “defendant’s contacts with Rhode Island were on behalf of his employer and were not sufficient to support a finding that he purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in Rhode Island.” Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 233. Likewise, we agree with USAA’s argument that, because it was acting on Baird’s behalf, we should decline to conclude that USAA “purposefully availed itself” of Rhode Island law. See id. For this reason, the check returned as “Not Authorized” at Baird’s direction is not sufficient to support a finding that USAA purposefully availed itself of Rhode Island law.', 'Moreover, and to USAA’s point, the rescinded credit-card payments were not paid directly to plaintiff or his Rhode Island bank account; rather, they were paid from Baird’s USAA account, according to the complaint, “to [five] different national credit[-]card accounts belonging to [p]laintiff.” The plaintiff acknowledged in the Superior Court that the money was paid from USAA to “credit issuers from several other states.” (Emphasis added.) This indicates to us that', '-9- USAA’s rescission of credit-card payments was not only on behalf of Baird, but also was not targeted at Rhode Island. See Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 233. Although plaintiff lives in Rhode Island and owns the affected accounts, we cannot rely on the unilateral activities of a plaintiff to assert jurisdiction over a defendant. See Rose, 819 A.2d at 1255 (reiterating the principle that “the unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State” (brackets omitted) (quoting Benedick v. Picillo, 525 A.2d 1310, 1312 (R.I. 1987))).', 'Therefore, we hold that the Superior Court was correct in finding that it did not have specific personal jurisdiction over USAA.', 'B', 'Jurisdiction Over Baird', 'The plaintiff additionally argues that the trial justice erred in granting Baird’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.4 The plaintiff asserts that the Superior Court had specific jurisdiction over Baird.5 The plaintiff alleges that an exercise of specific jurisdiction over Baird does not offend fundamental principles of fair play and substantial justice.', 'As explained supra, the determination of whether specific jurisdiction exists over a defendant requires a two-step inquiry: (1) determining whether there are sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state; and (2) determining that litigation in the forum state does not “offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Rose, 819 A.2d at 1250 (quoting International Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at 316). In determining whether litigation in the forum state 4', 'Notably, plaintiff did not raise this argument in his initial Rule 12A statement; rather, he addressed the issue in his Rule 12A(4) show cause supplemental statement, in response to arguments on the issue of jurisdiction made by Baird in his Rule 12A counterstatement. 5', 'The plaintiff did not raise the issue of general jurisdiction with regard to Baird. As such, we limit our analysis of personal jurisdiction over Baird to the issue of specific jurisdiction.', '- 10 - offends traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, courts look to the “so-called ‘[G]estalt factors’ to determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable[.]” Cerberus Partners, L.P., 836 A.2d at 1121. “These factors include the burden on the defendant, the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.” Id. (citing World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980); State of Maryland Central Collection Unit v. Board of Regents for Education of University of Rhode Island, 529 A.2d 144, 151 (R.I. 1987)).', 'The Gestalt factors are at issue only when sufficient minimum contacts have been established. See Cerberus Partners, L.P., 836 A.2d at 1121. “Although these factors may establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required, they must be compelling if they are to defeat jurisdiction over a defendant with purposeful and clear contacts.” State of Maryland Central Collection Unit, 529 A.2d at 151. Again, in reviewing the record, we accept the facts alleged by plaintiff as true and view disputed facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Cassidy, 920 A.2d at 232.', 'Here, plaintiff does not take issue with the trial justice’s finding that Baird had sufficient minimum contacts with Rhode Island. Rather, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in finding that specific jurisdiction failed with regard to the “fair play and substantial justice” prong and application of the Gestalt factors.6 We briefly address each factor and the party it favors. 6', 'The trial justice, in her bench decision, found that plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of jurisdiction based on Baird’s contacts with Rhode Island. As plaintiff does not contest this finding, and there is no cross-appeal by Baird, we decline to address the issue of minimum contacts and instead focus our analysis on the application of the Gestalt factors.', '- 11 -', 'The first factor is the burden on the defendant. Cerberus Partners, L.P., 836 A.2d at 1121. With regard to this factor, plaintiff argues that because “no medical affidavit of any kind” was offered to show that travel to Rhode Island from Florida would be difficult for Baird, the trial justice erred in weighing the first factor in favor of Baird. In support of his argument that Baird could easily travel, he states that “Baird is a licensed driver with extensive travel experience” and that Baird called plaintiff to tell him “that he was coming to Rhode Island to watch certain legal proceedings” against plaintiff. The plaintiff therefore argues that this factor should weigh in his favor. We disagree. As noted by the trial justice, “plaintiff doesn’t even dispute * * * the fact that Mr. Baird has some significant health issues. It’s really [plaintiff] who recited for the [c]ourt in his pleading Mr. Baird’s hospitalizations and history of mental health problems which included PTSD, and has suggested that he’s also afflicted by schizophrenia.” Additionally, the trial justice reviewed emails “which clearly demonstrate that Mr. Baird has been in and out of the hospital” and that the “health issues are not minor” or “fleeting[.]” As such, this factor clearly weighs in favor of Baird, with plaintiff readily admitting Baird’s health issues.', 'The second factor is the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute. Cerberus Partners, L.P., 836 A.2d at 1121. The plaintiff argues that Rhode Island has an interest because “[t]his case is about a check that was dishonored in a Rhode Island account and the looting of this [Rhode Island] resident[’s] Rhode Island based credit[-]card accounts after final payment to him of money fairly owed.” With respect to this factor, which looks at the forum state’s interest and does not ask us to compare the interests of other states, we agree with plaintiff that Rhode Island does have some interest in adjudicating the dispute. As such, the second factor weighs in favor of plaintiff.', '- 12 -', 'The third factor is the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy. Cerberus Partners, L.P., 836 A.2d at 1121. The plaintiff advances no argument in support of this factor. Baird, however, argues that “this controversy centers around a Florida estate, a Florida resident and activities conducted in Florida” and that, therefore, Florida is “the most logical and convenient forum to obtain relief.” We agree with Baird. Although plaintiff is a resident of Rhode Island, the majority of what transpired occurred in Florida. Florida is where the agreement was finalized and where the majority of the work allegedly took place, especially because the will dispute was in Florida. This leads us to conclude that the third factor weighs in favor of Baird.', 'The final factor is the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies. Cerberus Partners L.P., 836 A.2d at 1121. The plaintiff disputes this factor by indicating that “[t]his book account case is not about any legal concerns of the State of Florida.” However, as we noted supra with regard to the third factor, Florida has an interest in this case because the majority of the transaction between the parties occurred there. It is from Florida that Baird had the monetary payments rescinded, which is of primary concern to plaintiff; and Florida is also where the so-called “war room” to combat the will dispute was set up.

28,State : v. : Stephen Mulcahey. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 3, 2019, on appeal by the defendant, Stephen Mulcahey, from a judgment of conviction, following a jury trial, for first-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the Superior Court erred in admitting evidence of text messages allegedly sent by the defendant to the complainant because, he argues, the text messages were not properly authenticated under Rule 901 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In October 2013, Victoria,1 the complainant, a seventeen-year-old high school senior, was residing with her maternal aunt, Cristee McCormick (McCormick), in an apartment in Coventry, Rhode Island. The defendant, who was McCormick’s boyfriend, also lived at the apartment for an unspecified period after McCormick obtained custody of Victoria. At trial, the complainant described defendant as kind of “like a father figure,” who would help her with her 1', 'We refer to the complainant in this case by a pseudonym.', '-1- schoolwork and provide transportation when needed. However, Victoria testified, defendant sometimes made her feel uncomfortable: “Well, if he would give me a ride somewhere and when I would be like waiting in the car or something and we would go to a restaurant or something, he would like sit next to me and put his hand on my leg or something.”', 'On October 27, 2013, after spending the evening at a movie theater with her grandfather, Victoria returned to McCormick’s apartment to eat Chinese food and watch a scary movie with McCormick, defendant, and defendant’s brother. Victoria sat on the couch and covered herself with a comforter blanket. The defendant sat between Victoria and McCormick, and defendant’s brother was seated on a chair.', 'According to Victoria, just before the movie was about to begin, defendant pulled the blanket over her head. Victoria tried to move the comforter out of the way, “but then things happened.” The defendant started to rub Victoria’s back, which made her feel “uncomfortable and a little bit nervous[.]” Victoria testified that she “thought that [defendant] thought that [she] was [McCormick] so [she] tried to move around so that he would know that it was [her].” Then defendant “started to rub [her] butt[,]” and, again, she tried to move around more to indicate to defendant that she was not McCormick. The defendant, however, proceeded to rub Victoria’s belly under her clothes, and he touched her vagina.', 'At that point, when McCormick walked to the bathroom and then to the kitchen to smoke a cigarette, defendant whispered in Victoria’s ear that he wanted to “kiss [her] down there[,]” and “taste [her] down there and lick [her].” The defendant then put his hand inside her vagina. When she tried to pull defendant’s hand out by grabbing his arm, he “put it in harder[,]” which “really hurt and it made [Victoria] very afraid.” Victoria estimated that the assault lasted for about thirty minutes. When the movie ended, Victoria went next door to her grandmother’s apartment to shower, and she noticed that she was bleeding from her vagina.', '-2-', 'Within hours of the assault, at 12:30 a.m., Victoria received the following four text messages from defendant:', '“Hope I didn’t do anything to upset you good night sleep well”', '“Did I upset you”', '“Good night sleep well you are a beautiful person”', '“Can’t stop thinking about you” At 7:37 a.m., Victoria received the following text message from defendant: “Good morning hope you have a great day[.]” And, at 11:19 a.m., Victoria received the following text message from defendant: “Are you still sleeping[?]” After the last text message, Victoria took a screenshot of her phone depicting the six text messages from defendant, but she did not respond to any of them.', 'The next day, while driving to a therapy appointment, Victoria told McCormick about the assault. She also told her therapist, Eric McKnight, who immediately reported the assault to the Coventry police. Later that day, Victoria and McCormick went to the Coventry police station to report the assault. A Coventry police officer advised Victoria to go to the hospital. But, at the hospital, she testified, she was afraid to undergo an examination and “felt very scared to do that” and was “freaking out.” According to Victoria, the doctors “said that they weren’t going to do anything because they didn’t want to make [her] more scared.”', 'On October 31, 2013, Victoria met with Detective Jason Burlingame (Det. Burlingame), the Coventry police officer who had been assigned to the investigation. Victoria told Det. Burlingame about the text messages she received from defendant and showed him the screenshot of her phone. Detective Burlingame testified that he interviewed defendant and that, when he showed defendant the screenshot of the text messages, defendant stated that he had sent them.', 'On March 4, 2014, defendant was charged by criminal indictment with one count of first- degree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-2. The defendant filed a pretrial motion in limine', '-3- to suppress evidence of the text messages, arguing that the state would not be able to meet its burden to properly authenticate the evidence in accordance with Rule 901 through the testimony of Victoria alone. The state, however, argued that Victoria’s testimony about her history of texting defendant was sufficient to properly authenticate the text message evidence.', 'After hearing arguments from both parties, the trial justice, citing to federal caselaw, laid out the following six factors for the court to consider when determining whether evidence of text messages has been properly authenticated: (1) “Whether someone with personal knowledge connects the person to the specific phone and phone number”; (2) “The witness must show through direct or circumstantial evidence that the phone has the capacity to send and receive text messages”; (3) “The witness needs to explain how the caller I.D. on the phone where the texts [were] received links [the] text messages by a name or number to a particular person”; (4) “[D]irect or circumstantial evidence that [the person has] received phone calls or text messages from that number * * * in the past”; (5) “The witness must testify that they received and read the text messages”; and (6) Circumstantial evidence establishing authorship.2 The trial justice then reserved ruling on the motion, and the case proceeded to trial.', 'At trial, Victoria testified that, about a year before the assault, defendant provided her with his cell phone number and she saved the number in her contacts under the name “Steph.”3 Victoria testified that her phone was capable of sending and receiving text messages, and that she routinely exchanged text messages with defendant for a variety of reasons, such as to arrange rides to and from school and therapy appointments. Simply put, Victoria would text defendant, and he would arrive to transport her to and from her appointments. Victoria further testified that, 2', 'We note that the factors relied upon by the trial justice are relevant to this inquiry, but not controlling. 3', 'Victoria referred to defendant as “Steph” because “that’s what everyone called him.”', '-4- within hours of the assault, she received the text messages from defendant, which she read but to which she did not respond.', 'At that point, the trial justice addressed the authentication issue at the sidebar. After hearing arguments from the parties, the trial justice found that “based on the foundational questions,” the state had met its burden, and she therefore denied defendant’s motion in limine. The prosecutor then showed the screenshot to Victoria and proceeded to lay additional foundation:', '“Q.', '* * *. Are you familiar with that photograph?', '“A.', 'Yes. * * *', '“Q.', 'What is that a photograph of?', '“A.', 'A text that Ste[p]h sent me that night and in the morning.', '***', '“Q.', 'When was that photograph taken?', '“A.', 'After I got the last text message. * * *', '“Q.', 'Did you take that photograph or did someone else take the', 'photograph?', '“A.', 'I did.

The defendant’s motion for a new trial was heard and denied on April 29, 2015. The defendant was sentenced to thirty-five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with twenty years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. The defendant filed a notice of appeal on June 1, 2015.4 4', 'The Superior Court did not enter final judgment until June 15, 2015. The defendant’s notice of appeal, although premature, is sufficient because judgment was entered thereafter. See Article I,', '-5-', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.” State v. Stokes, 200 A.3d 144, 150 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Alves, 183 A.3d 539, 542 (R.I. 2018)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id. (quoting State v. Adams, 161 A.3d 1182, 1194 (R.I. 2017)).', 'Analysis', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he admitted evidence of the text messages based on the state’s failure to authenticate the messages under Rule 901. Specifically, defendant argues that, to authenticate evidence of text messages, the proponent must establish authorship through either direct or circumstantial evidence. According to defendant, to establish authorship through circumstantial evidence, the proponent must produce evidence of distinctive characteristics of the text messages. The defendant argues that, because the state did not produce either direct evidence or evidence of distinctive characteristics of the text messages, it did not establish that the text messages were authored by defendant and, therefore, did not properly authenticate the evidence in accordance with Rule 901.', 'Reliability is the linchpin of the law of evidence. The authentication requirement of Rule 901 is a threshold requirement to establishing the reliability of a matter of evidence. O’Connor v. Newport Hospital, 111 A.3d 317, 322 (R.I. 2015). Rule 901 provides, in part:', '“The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition', 'precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to Rule 4(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure (“A notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision, sentence or order but before entry of the judgment or order shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof.”); see also Toegemann v.

Evid. 901(a). “The burden of proof for authentication, however, is slight.” Adams, 161 A.3d at 1199 (brackets omitted) (quoting O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323). Indeed, to authenticate evidence under Rule 901, the proponent of such evidence does not face a high hurdle.', '“In making Rule 901 determinations, trial justices must decide whether there is enough support in the record to conclude that it is ‘reasonably probable’ that the evidence is what its offeror proclaims it to be.” Adams, 161 A.3d at 1199 (brackets and alteration omitted) (quoting O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323). “If so, then the evidence’s [per]suasive force is for the jury to decide.” Id. (quoting O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323). “Thus, a trial justice need not find that the evidence is necessarily what the proponent claims, but only that there is sufficient evidence that the jury ultimately might do so.” Id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323).', 'This Court has not yet spoken on the issue of authenticating text message evidence. But we have addressed the use of text message evidence in the context of a probation violation hearing and acknowledged that “[s]trict application of the rules of evidence is not required at a probation violation hearing.” State v. McLaughlin, 935 A.2d 938, 942 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Rioux, 708 A.2d 895, 898 (R.I. 1998)). In McLaughlin, we held that a photograph of the complainant’s phone, which depicted text messages purportedly sent by the defendant, was properly authenticated by the testimony of a police officer who took the photograph. Id. We reasoned that the officer’s testimony that he examined the phone, and that he determined that the text messages were unaltered and had been sent from the same number that officers used to contact the defendant, was sufficient for authentication. Id.', 'In O’Connor, this Court considered, as a matter of first impression, whether a printout of an e-mail was properly authenticated under Rule 901. O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323. We stated', '-7- that an e-mail may be authenticated by direct evidence, “through the testimony of a witness with personal knowledge that the proffered exhibit is what it is claimed to be, such as the author or recipient of the email[,]” or by “circumstantial evidence, including ‘appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.’” Id. at 325 (brackets omitted) (quoting R.I. R. Evid. 904(b)(4)). Accordingly, we held that the testimony of a witness who was neither the sender nor the recipient of the e-mail, but who merely recited the identity of the purported sender and summarized the contents of the message, was insufficient for authentication. Id.', 'There is, however, a fundamental difference between text messages, which generally are sent to one person known to the sender, and an e-mail.', 'When, as here, the Rhode Island rule mirrors the federal rule, we look to decisions of federal courts for guidance. E.g., Chhun v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 84 A.3d 419, 422 (R.I. 2014); Hall v. Kuzenka, 843 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 2004); Heal v. Heal, 762 A.2d 463, 466-67 (R.I. 2000). In United States v. Davis, 918 F.3d 397 (4th Cir. 2019), for example, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the use of text messages and held that authentication of text message evidence under Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires “only a prima facie showing that the ‘true author’ is who the proponent claims it to be.” Davis, 918 F.3d at 402; see also United States v. Lewisbey, 843 F.3d 653, 658 (7th Cir. 2016) (holding that, for purposes of authentication under Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the proponent need only produce enough evidence to support a finding that the person sent and received the text messages); United States v. Barnes, 803 F.3d 209, 217 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding that conclusive proof of authorship is not required for authentication under Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence). “And the prima facie showing ‘may be accomplished largely by', '-8- offering circumstantial evidence that the documents in question are what they purport to be.’” Davis, 918 F.3d at 402 (quoting United States v. Vidacak, 553 F.3d 344, 350 (4th Cir. 2009)).', 'The Davis court determined that the proponent produced enough circumstantial evidence to properly authenticate evidence of text messages exchanged between the accused, who was charged with conspiracy, and a confidential informant. Davis, 918 F.3d at 402. First, the court reasoned, the context and purpose of the text messages—to arrange the location of the controlled buy and the price for the contraband—supported the conclusion that the defendant was the author of the text messages because the defendant was witnessed arriving at the agreed-upon location and engaging in the controlled buy. Id. Second, before the controlled buy, the defendant spoke on the phone with the informant, and the defendant testified at trial that the telephone call was made to “the same number that the informant was texting” to set up the controlled buy. Id. at 403 (brackets omitted). Finally, there was no evidence that the contact information linked to the number from which the text messages were sent referred to any person other than the defendant. Id.; see United States v. Fults, 639 F. App’x 366, 373 (6th Cir. 2016) (holding that the content of the text messages and testimony about previous communications with the author using the same number were enough to properly authenticate the evidence).', 'Here, unlike the proffered e-mail in O’Connor, the state produced evidence beyond a mere recitation of the author’s identity and summary of the contents of the proffered evidence. As in Davis, the state presented testimony about previous communications between Victoria and defendant and produced evidence as to the context and timing of the text messages to establish authorship.', 'Both the incriminating context and timing of the text messages are not only probative of guilt, but highly relevant for authentication. Victoria also testified that defendant personally provided her with his cell phone number about a year before the assault and that she saved it in her contacts under “Steph.” Victoria exchanged text messages with the number', '-9- associated with “Steph” on multiple occasions prior to the date of the assault. For example, Victoria would text “Steph” to arrange transportation to and from school and Victoria’s therapy appointments. And, when Victoria texted “Steph” to pick her up, defendant picked her up. Additionally, the text messages depicted in the screenshot were not only apologetic in nature but were also sent to Victoria within hours of the assault.', 'We conclude that the state produced sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that the defendant authored the text messages. We therefore hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the text messages, because the evidence was properly authenticated under Rule 901. Any doubt as to whether the defendant authored the text messages was for the jury to resolve.', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

29,In re Roman A. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This termination of parental rights case came before this Court for oral argument more than five years after the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF or the Department) first petitioned to remove the child, Roman A., from his mother, the respondent. On appeal, the non-Indian mother of an Indian child, who was born suffering from severe medical issues, asserts that the Family Court erred when it terminated her parental rights contrary to the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA or the Act).1 We disagree and affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Roman A. was born to the respondent, Carla Alvarenga (Mother), and Nicolas Noka, who is a member of the Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, in February 2014.2 Unfortunately, 1', 'We recognize that many individuals tracing their roots to the native peoples of this country prefer the term “Native American” to “Indian.” We use the term “Indian” in this opinion because the relevant federal statute and caselaw use that term. We mean no disrespect. 2', 'The parties agree that Mother is not Native American.', '-1- Roman required immediate treatment for complex congenital heart disease and the infant was hospitalized for nearly all of the first six months of his young life, either in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. Roman was diagnosed with Double Inlet Left Ventricle and Ventricle Septal Defect, colloquially known as being born with “half of a heart.” In effect, Roman’s heart was unable to properly deliver blood to his lungs.', 'Roman was required to undergo several medical procedures during the early days and months of his life, some of them very serious and life-threatening. In March 2014, Roman was transported to Boston for a cardiac catheterization, a less invasive means of achieving open-heart surgery whereby wires are inserted through the groin for the purpose of taking pictures of the heart. In May 2014, Roman underwent a second cardiac catheterization. The next month, Roman underwent open-heart surgery.', 'In July, because Roman was having difficulty feeding, a gastrostomy tube, or G-tube, was inserted so that food could be delivered directly to his stomach.', 'Unfortunately, the heart condition was not the only obstacle the child faced. DCYF had received reports on its hotline from both Hasbro Children’s Hospital and Boston Children’s Hospital about Roman’s family and, in August 2014, a practitioner at Boston Children’s Hospital filed a Report of Examination with DCYF. Shortly thereafter, DCYF filed a petition in the Family Court alleging neglect on the part of both Mother and Mr. Noka, and the child was removed from his mother’s care via an ex parte order of the court. By the end of August 2014, Roman was discharged from the hospital to a foster home.3', 'DCYF created its first of several case plans in October 2014. It is clear from a review of those case plans that reunifying Roman with Mother remained a goal for an extensive period of 3', 'Roman did spend approximately three weeks at Mother’s home between intervening hospital stays during this period.', '-2- time. By August 2015, however, DCYF filed a petition to terminate Mother’s parental rights, alleging that Roman had been placed in DCYF’s custody or care for at least twelve months, that “the parents were offered or received services to correct the situation which led to the child being placed,” and that “there is not a substantial probability that the child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of time considering that child’s age and the need for a permanent home.”4', 'In March 2016, the Family Court was prepared to hold a hearing and take evidence on the initial neglect petition that had been filed by DCYF almost two years earlier, and then proceed, if necessary, to hear DCYF’s termination petition with respect to Mother.', 'However, after a conference, the initial petition was amended to add a claim of dependency and the trial justice explained that she was providing Mother with what she termed “an opportunity” for three additional months to become compliant with DCYF case planning. Mother admitted dependency and was ordered to comply. However, when the three-month period provided by the trial justice came to an end, DCYF sought to terminate Mother’s parental rights, alleging that Mother, despite the benefit of additional time, had failed to cooperate and comply. Trial commenced in September 2016, and continued over diverse dates until November of that year.', 'After the trial concluded, the trial justice issued an exhaustive, sixty-two-page written decision in which she summarized the testimony of all witnesses and made fifty-three findings of fact. The testimony particularly relevant to our review includes, among others, a pediatric cardiologist, a social worker, and the director of a department in the Narragansett Tribe. We recount the most relevant testimony as follows. 4', 'The parental rights of Roman’s father were terminated on default upon proof of abandonment. The father has not appealed that decree.', '-3-', 'Dr. Kristin Lombardi', 'Kristin Lombardi, M.D., is a pediatric cardiologist who was Roman’s treating physician at Women & Infants Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital. At the time of trial, Dr. Lombardi had been treating Roman since his birth. She testified as an expert in pediatric cardiology for DCYF, opining that Roman will require significant cardiac care throughout his life and that he is likely to experience neurodevelopmental and cognitive limitations. She also testified that any person who is Roman’s caretaker would need to be able to recognize a number of factors to properly care for him, including recognizing changes in his color and his activity level. Doctor Lombardi testified that, despite multiple and lengthy conversations with Mother, Mother “did not have a good grasp on the severity of [Roman’s] heart disease[,]” and the doctor expressed concerns about whether Mother could provide the level of care that Roman required.', 'Lena Sousa', 'Lena Sousa, a DCYF social worker who had been assigned to Roman’s case in August 2014 and who remained the social worker on the case throughout its entirety, also testified on behalf of DCYF. She testified that she discussed the concerns of Boston Children’s Hospital with Mother that Mother had been unavailable for appointments, procedures, and phone calls and that Mother had failed to comply with the care plan that the hospital had developed. Ms. Sousa also testified about the case plans that DCYF had developed. She said that, in September 2014, she had met with Mother and had explained that a case plan involves services DCYF would request Mother to complete so that the Department could evaluate the prospects for reunification. However, she testified, Mother said that she was not interested in participating in services because she was busy. Ms. Sousa also explained to Mother that DCYF would look to a different goal if Roman remained in DCYF’s care for an extended period of time. In spite of Mother’s insistence', '-4- that she was too busy to participate, the first case plan created by Ms. Sousa nonetheless retained the goal of reunifying Roman with Mother. The case plan included several areas in which Mother needed to make changes or improvements in order to be reunified with Roman, including addressing domestic violence, parenting, mental health, and meeting the medical needs of Roman. Mother was required to engage in a parent/child evaluation, demonstrate that she could meet Roman’s needs during visits, make use of parenting and mental health services, attend medical appointments, and act upon doctors’ recommendations, including those involving Roman’s medications.', 'Regarding domestic violence, an issue that was included in the case plans as a result of an alleged incident that involved Roman’s father at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, Ms. Sousa testified that she either made referrals or provided mother with the names of multiple resources. Addressing domestic violence remained in the case plans throughout the case’s entirety, because that issue was never addressed by Mother. Anger management also became a part of the case plans following Mother’s arrest as the result of a road-rage incident. Ms. Sousa testified that she was forced to send the same list of anger management providers to Mother about eight times in a single week because Mother repeatedly requested the information. Ms. Sousa testified that she was unaware as to whether Mother partook of any anger management services.', 'With respect to engaging in a parent/child evaluation, Ms. Sousa testified that she referred Mother to John Parsons, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, but Mother never participated in an evaluation with him. At one point, Mother told Ms. Sousa “something to the effect that * * * she didn’t need anyone to tell her she was a good mother and/or label her as mental[.]” When it became clear that the evaluation with Dr. Parsons would not be accomplished, Ms. Sousa made a referral to Brian Hayden, Ph.D., also a clinical psychologist. Mother was willing to comply with Dr.', '-5- Hayden, according to Ms. Sousa, but after Dr. Hayden conducted the psychological evaluation of Mother, she refused to return to Dr. Hayden for the parent/child portion of the evaluation because, according to Ms. Sousa, Mother did not like Dr. Hayden’s evaluation. Mother did not participate in the parent/child piece of the evaluation until June 2016, nearly two years after the case initially was opened, and did so only after the trial justice ordered her to comply. Ms. Sousa made the referral, to Spurwink Rhode Island, for that completed evaluation.', 'Ms. Sousa testified that making use of parenting and mental health services had been included in the initial case plan because of reports that Mother blamed hospital and hospital staff and believed that they were targeting her, and also because of conversations Ms. Sousa had with Mother. Ms. Sousa also testified that she provided Mother with the names of multiple service providers that could address Mother’s mental health issues. She said that Mother told her that she was willing to go to the Providence Center, and so Ms. Sousa made a call to set up an appointment there on Mother’s behalf. When Ms. Sousa called, however, she was told that Mother was required to set up the appointment herself. Mother later informed Ms. Sousa that she had attempted to set up an appointment herself, but that she was unable to do so because there was a waiting list. Ms. Sousa followed up with the agency to inquire about the waiting period, however, and the agency informed Ms. Sousa that there was, in fact, no waiting list. Ms. Sousa testified that she continued to remind Mother that receiving mental health services was a part of the plan. To Ms. Sousa’s knowledge, the required mental health services in the final plan were never successfully completed.', 'Ms. Sousa also testified that she would, either by phone or email, inform Mother about Roman’s medical appointments. On one occasion, however, Mother refused to provide her new phone number to Ms. Sousa, while at the same time insisting that she did not receive her emails.', '-6- Ms. Sousa also testified that Mother admitted to attending only two of Roman’s medical appointments over the seven-month period that spanned from September 2014 to March 2015, even though Roman had approximately three appointments per week. Ms. Sousa testified that on one occasion Mother told her she did not understand how attending appointments would prove that she was capable of caring for Roman. Ms. Sousa testified that attending medical appointments was a part of each case plan DCYF had created, until the termination petition was filed and reunification was no longer the goal, and that, over the entirety of the case, Mother failed to consistently attend medical appointments.', 'Ms. Sousa also explained that, in September 2014, Mother refused to allow Roman to receive certain injections that the cardiologist had recommended because of Roman’s weakened immune system, and also that Mother did not want Roman to receive a flu shot. Ms. Sousa also testified that Mother was not making progress in the area of following doctors’ recommendations at the time the second case plan was created. Ms. Sousa testified that Roman’s medical needs were a continuous aspect of the case plan.', 'Ms. Sousa further recounted several troubling occurrences that she learned took place while Mother was with Roman. At one visit, at a time when Roman had a G-tube inserted, Mother attempted to give Roman either apple juice or milk. When it was explained to Mother why this was inappropriate because of the G-Tube, Mother expressed that she had not followed doctors’ instructions in the past.', 'Ms. Sousa also testified to another occasion during which the gastroenterologist felt compelled to inform Mother that it was inappropriate for her to give candy to Roman. On another occasion, Ms. Sousa had to review Roman’s approved snack list with Mother after she fed a doughnut to Roman, which was not an approved snack. Ms. Sousa further testified that, following a doctor’s visit in February 2015, Mother expressed to Ms. Sousa that', '-7- Roman was getting sick as a result of his then-foster mother kissing him, and Mother requested that the foster mother neither kiss nor hug Roman.', 'Ms. Sousa related that, to her knowledge, since March 2016, when the court gave Mother an additional three months to take advantage of the services and comply with DCYF case planning, Mother had failed to complete any of the required services. She also testified that Roman had been in the same foster home for about sixteen or seventeen months, that Roman was comfortable with his foster parents, “wants to be around them all the time[,]” and that the foster home was preadoptive in nature.', 'Sarah Dodd', 'Further germane to this review is the testimony of Sarah Dodd, a family support specialist in the family visitation program at Boys Town New England. Ms. Dodd testified that her job at Boys Town involves monitoring court-mandated visitations and teaching a class called “Common Sense Parenting,” which attempts to develop positive parenting skills. Ms. Dodd was assigned to work with Mother in November 2015, and she did so until March 2016. During that period, Ms. Dodd testified, she had approximately sixteen or seventeen visits with Mother. In the program, Mother was permitted to visit with Roman once per week under the supervision of Ms. Dodd and had permission to attend Roman’s medical appointments. Ms. Dodd also interacted with Mother through the Common Sense Parenting class.', 'Although Ms. Dodd said that Mother completed the Common Sense Parenting class, she also testified that Mother struggled to arrive at visitation appointments on time, missed at least one appointment, and would not be prepared for appointments, such as failing to provide a snack for Roman. Ms. Dodd also testified that Mother had expressed to her that she did not appreciate Ms. Dodd’s feedback and did not feel that Ms. Dodd’s services were necessary.', '-8-', 'In March 2016, Ms. Dodd’s work with Mother came to an end because Mother was deemed to be noncompliant with the Boys Town visitation program. During the last visit, at which Ms. Dodd informed Mother that she was being discharged from the visitation program, Mother became confrontational and indicated to Ms. Dodd that, in Ms. Dodd’s words, “she did not feel that she needed to be part of the program; that she wasn’t going to listen to any of our services; that she didn’t have to come prepared with the necessary items for the visits.” 5 Mother’s discharge summary from the Boys Town visitation program, signed by Ms. Dodd, further highlights that Mother was consistently late for visits and was resistant to Ms. Dodd’s suggestions.6', 'Caroline Gojcz', 'Caroline Gojcz, a licensed independent clinical social worker employed as a clinical supervisor in the family support center at Spurwink Rhode Island, testified as an expert for DCYF. Mother was referred to Spurwink by DCYF for a parent/child evaluation in May 2016 after the Family Court ordered Mother to comply with DCYF. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess Mother’s ability to care for Roman and to determine whether it would be appropriate for Roman to return to Mother’s care. Ms. Gojcz met with Mother four times individually and twice while Mother was visiting with Roman. It was Ms. Gojcz’s expert opinion, based on her review of the 5', 'During this final visit, Ms. Dodd testified, there was a safety concern involving Mother and her other child, who Ms. Dodd testified was approximately three or four years old at the time. Ms. Dodd explained that: “[T]here was concern of safety that took place with [the other child] and mom. I attempted to intervene several times. Mom told me not to talk to her, not to talk to her children. Our visit room was destroyed.” Ms. Dodd later explained that the other child “dumped things out all over the room” and that she was concerned the child might leave the building after she ran down the hallway. 6', 'Carol Wild, also an employee of Boys Town New England, briefly testified on behalf of DCYF. Ms. Wild worked with Mother between January 2015 and September 2015, as part of the family visitation program, but ceased working with Mother when she was promoted to a different position within Boys Town. Ms. Wild testified that, even though Mother was initially frustrated with the program, she did make progress and did cooperate with Ms. Wild. She also testified to a letter she wrote that indicated that Mother had made excellent progress.', '-9- information she gathered from not only her observations of Mother but also a review of various reports and contacts, that “there is a high risk of [Roman] reunifying with [Mother].”', 'Brian Hayden', 'Testimony was also provided by Dr. Hayden, who was qualified as an expert in clinical psychology. Doctor Hayden evaluated Mother in March 2015 for about three to three-and-a-half hours. Doctor Hayden explained that the results of Mother’s personality assessment profile were consistent with a diagnosis for bipolar mood disorder. Doctor Hayden also opined that Mother encounters problems with coping and that she relies on denial and distraction. He also testified that she is prone to fits of rage. Doctor Hayden testified that Mother was “lacking in * * * empathy, the ability to take the perspective of another person’s point of view, and to go one step further and to feel genuine compassion and want to take care of somebody.” Doctor Hayden also had planned to observe Mother with her children, but Mother failed to show up for the scheduled visitation appointment that Dr. Hayden had attended. Doctor Hayden also testified that when he followed- up, he was informed that Mother did not intend to complete this piece of the evaluation. Although Dr. Hayden testified that he was not in a position to render an opinion about whether Mother could parent Roman safely and effectively, as a result of not having had the opportunity to observe Mother with her children, Dr. Hayden nonetheless said that he had “considerable concerns as to whether [Mother] fully appreciated the seriousness of Roman’s medical difficulties[.]” Doctor Hayden testified that Mother “had difficulty in perceiving [Roman needing medical treatment from hospital staff] as individuals who were trying to help her child” and, as an expert in clinical psychology, he “would have some concerns about the appropriateness of [Mother] providing sufficient care, particularly in terms of the safety of Roman.”', '- 10 -', 'Wenonah Harris', 'The testimony of Wenonah Harris, the Director of Tribal Child and Family Services for the Narragansett Tribe, which included the roles of the ICWA Director and Child Advocate, was also important. Ms. Harris testified that Roman’s father is a member of the Tribe and that Roman also had become an enrolled member of the Tribe. Ms. Harris testified that the Narragansett Tribe had been provided with appropriate notice of the DCYF proceedings involving Roman. She explained that the Tribe declined to accept jurisdiction and participate from the outset because, if the Tribe had accepted jurisdiction in this case, “[Roman] would be dead” because the Tribe does “not have the ability to be [as] sophisticated [as] DCYF” and that “[DCYF] kept him alive when he should have been dead before his first year[.]”', 'Mother', 'Mother testified on her own behalf over the course of two days. Mother explained that she felt she “had a very good understanding” of how to care for Roman. Mother also testified that taking care of Roman is not “rocket science.” She said that she missed some of his doctor appointments because she either was informed too late, was unable to secure transportation to the locations, or was unfamiliar with the locations. Mother also testified that, at the beginning, she was not allowed to attend Roman’s doctors appointments. When explaining her understanding of why DCYF got involved in the first place, she testified that, early on when Roman was in the hospital, she would not go to the hospital because Roman’s father was stalking her there and therefore she did not feel comfortable at the hospital. Mother testified that she had attended all the medical appointments that she knew about since March 2016. In regard to engaging in DCYF services, she admitted that she did not participate in services initially, that she had engaged in some services prior to being ordered to follow through with services by the Family Court justice in', '- 11 - March 2016, and that she did engage with the majority of services when the Family Court ordered her to do so in March 2016. Mother’s partial response to a question on cross-examination is largely representative of her testimony as a whole: “I took the domestic violence classes. My attitude was a problem; I remedied the situation by taking counseling. So I really don’t know what else you guys want from me. I did the parent-child eval. I did the psych eval. What else do you want, make you a turkey for Thanksgiving?”7', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'After hearing all the testimony, and specifically finding Mother’s testimony incredible, the trial justice entered a decree granting DCYF’s petition to terminate Mother’s parental rights. Applying the ICWA, the trial justice found in her written decision that DCYF had met the burden under the ICWA of engaging in active efforts to reunify Roman with Mother, and that she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Roman would face serious emotional and physical harm if Mother was given custody of Roman. Mother timely appealed.', 'Before this Court, Mother argues that DCYF failed to engage in active efforts at reunifying Roman with her, that no “qualified expert witness” testified at trial pursuant to the ICWA, and that the trial justice erred in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that she was unfit to parent Roman. DCYF contends that the ICWA does not apply to this case because Mother is non-Indian and Roman’s Indian father never had custody, and further argues that if the ICWA does apply, DCYF met its burden under the ICWA.8 7', 'Thanksgiving in 2016 fell on November 24, nine days after Mother made this statement during her testimony. We also note that Roman’s foster parent, Adam Connell, testified for DCYF as a rebuttal witness following Mother’s testimony. We see no need to recount his testimony for purposes of this opinion. 8', 'The guardian ad litem in this case sides with respondent as relates to the application of the ICWA but with DCYF with respect to the contention that the record supports the finding that DCYF satisfied the ICWA’s requirements.', '- 12 -', 'II', 'Discussion', 'There can be no dispute that, as an enrolled member of the Narragansett Tribe, Roman is within the ambit of the ICWA, chapter 21 of title 25 of the United States Code. Nonetheless, this case raises questions about the extent of that coverage and whether all the provisions of the ICWA are applicable to the facts presented here. Specifically, do the provisions of § 1912(d) and (f) of the ICWA, which relate to “remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family[,]” 25 U.S.C. § 1901(d), and the heightened standard of proof the ICWA demands in a termination of parental rights case, apply to an Indian child who, at the time of termination, is not a part of an Indian family? Second, does § 1912(f) require “testimony of qualified expert witnesses” in a termination of parental rights case such as this, where the Indian child is in the custody of a non-Indian parent? Third, what constitutes “active efforts” under § 1912(d) of the ICWA?', 'Application of the Indian Child Welfare Act', 'As this Court discussed ten years ago, the ICWA recognizes that “there is no resource more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children[.]” In re Tamika R., 973 A.2d 547, 550 (R.I. 2009) (deletion omitted) (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 1901(3)). The ICWA further recognizes an unfortunate occurrence in this country’s history,', '“that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up', 'by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by', 'nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high', 'percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and', 'adoptive homes and institutions; and', '“[T]hat the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over', 'Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and', 'judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal', 'relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards', '- 13 -', 'prevailing in Indian communities and families.” Id. (deletion', 'omitted) (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 1901(4) and (5)). As such, Congress set forth “minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture.” Id. at 550-51 (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 1902). The primary purpose of the ICWA was “to stem the unwarranted removal of Indian children from intact Indian families.” Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 133 S. Ct. 2552, 2561 (2013) (emphasis added).', 'In this case, the parties agreed to the applicability of the ICWA, and the trial justice applied the provisions in § 1912(d) and (f) of the ICWA after stating on the record that “everyone is in full agreement that ICWA applies.” Section 1912(d) states:', '“Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or', 'termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law', 'shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide', 'remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent', 'the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved', 'unsuccessful.” Section 1912(f) states:', '“No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such', 'proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence', 'beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert', 'witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or', 'Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical', 'damage to the child.”', 'DCYF asserts that, because Roman’s mother is not of Indian heritage and Roman was not at any time in the custody of his father, from whom Roman takes his Indian heritage, the ICWA is inapplicable. This is so, according to the Department, because a breakup of an Indian family never occurred in this case. The Department maintains that its position is supported by the intent of the ICWA, and it draws this Court’s attention to the United States Supreme Court’s 2013 opinion in Adoptive Couple, cited supra.', '- 14 -', 'In Adoptive Couple, the biological father, a member of the Cherokee Nation, objected to the adoption of his biological daughter, who was 3/256 Cherokee. Adoptive Couple, 133 S. Ct. at 2558, 2559. The biological mother, who was non-Indian, relinquished her parental rights and had previously consented to the adoption. Id. at 2558. The South Carolina Supreme Court determined that the ICWA applied and that the provisions contained in § 1912(f) and (d) were not satisfied. Id. at 2559. The Supreme Court, however, held that, because the father, despite his efforts to invoke the ICWA, “had never had legal or physical custody of [the child] as of the time of the adoption proceedings[,]” he was not entitled to invoke § 1912(f). Id. at 2562. This interpretation of § 1912(f), according to the Court, “comports with the statutory text demonstrating that the primary mischief the ICWA was designed to counteract was the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian families due to the cultural insensitivity and biases of social workers and state courts.” Id. at 2561. Further, the Supreme Court held that “§ 1912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family’s ‘breakup’ would be precipitated by the termination of the parent’s rights.” Id. at 2562. The Court reasoned that “when an Indian parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has never been in the Indian parent’s legal or physical custody * * * the ‘breakup of the Indian family’ has long since occurred, and § 1912(d) is inapplicable.” Id.', 'Mother and the guardian ad litem, on the other hand, each argue that the ICWA does apply. Mother points out that the ICWA applies because the Code of Federal Regulations states that the “ICWA includes requirements that apply whenever an Indian child is the subject of * * * [a] child- custody proceeding[.]” 25 C.F.R. § 23.103(a)(1) (2016). Mother also argues that the holding in Adoptive Couple is inapposite.', 'We are of the opinion that, simply because the ICWA may in general apply “whenever an Indian child is the subject of * * * [a] child-custody proceeding,” 25 C.F.R. § 23.103(a)(1), it does', '- 15 - not follow that every provision of the ICWA applies each time the ICWA is implicated. For example, § 1912(a) of the ICWA dictates that notice shall be given to the tribe of the Indian child any time there is an “involuntary proceeding in a State Court[.]” This provision would seem to apply even to an Indian child who had been previously adopted by non-Indian parents who are subsequently subject to a termination of parental rights proceeding. In such a case, even though the child has already been removed from his Indian family, the tribe would still have an interest in the child’s placement, and the tribe must be notified. See § 1912(a) (requiring notice to child’s tribe in termination of parental rights cases); see also Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 109 S. Ct. 1597, 1609 (1989) (“The numerous prerogatives accorded the tribes through the ICWA’s substantive provisions * * * must * * * be seen as a means of protecting not only the interests of individual Indian children and families, but also of the tribes themselves.”).', 'On the other hand, § 1912(d), which addresses remedial services and rehabilitative programs “designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family,” would seem far less relevant. See Adoptive Couple, 133 S. Ct. at 2563 (“Section 1912(d) is a sensible requirement when applied to state social workers who might otherwise be too quick to remove Indian children from their Indian families. It would, however, be unusual to apply § 1912(d) in the context of an Indian parent who abandoned a child prior to birth and who never had custody of the child.”).9 9', 'We note that Mother also argues that the so-called “existing Indian family doctrine,” which apparently allows state courts, according to Mother, “to refuse to apply provisions of the [ICWA] * * * when the court finds the connection between the parent or the child to Indian culture to be too tenuous[,]” is a minority position. Nevertheless, Mother does not have a tenuous relationship with Indian culture, she is simply not of Indian heritage. What’s more, at the time of the termination trial, Roman did not have a custodial parent who was Indian because his father’s rights were previously terminated. In any event, we have already noted supra that the ICWA, as a whole, applies in any relevant case based on the existence of an Indian child, but that every provision may not necessarily be relevant.', '- 16 -', 'After reviewing the relevant case law, this Court has grave reservations as to whether the provisions contained in § 1912(d) and (f) apply in this case.10 Nevertheless, because (1) all parties agreed at trial that the Act should apply; (2) relying on that agreement, the trial justice applied both provisions; and (3) it was not until this appeal that one of the parties, DCYF, first questioned the applicability of the Act, we will assume without deciding that the provisions contained in § 1912(d) and (f) of the ICWA apply in this case. We observe that the application of these provisions will in no way prejudice the child because, as discussed below, the ICWA imposes a higher burden on the state than does our traditional framework in a case involving the termination of parental rights.', 'Standard of Review', 'Having determined that § 1912(d) and (f) of the ICWA will be applied given the posture of this case, it is necessary to discuss how those provisions impact the typical framework this Court applies in review of a decree terminating parental rights. In the typical review, this Court: “(1) examine[s] the trial justice’s finding of parental unfitness; (2) review[s] the finding that reasonable efforts at reunification were made by the state agency charged with that duty; and (3) review[s] the finding that termination is in the child[ ]’s best interests.” In re James H., 181 A.3d 19, 25 (R.I. 2018) (quoting In re Max M., 116 A.3d 185, 193 (R.I. 2015)). In conducting this review, the Court determines if the state’s allegations are supported “by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 193). While clear and convincing evidence must be found, this Court nonetheless affords the trial justice considerable discretion and examines “the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists to support the findings of the trial justice.” Id. (quoting 10', 'The Court does recognize that at least one other court has held that in a case involving the termination of parental rights of a non-Indian parent, that parent must still receive active efforts under § 1912(d) of the ICWA, in spite of the Supreme Court’s holding in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 133 S. Ct. 2552 (2013). See In re Adoption of T.A.W., 383 P.3d 492, 506-07 (Wash. 2016).', '- 17 - In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198, 202 (R.I. 2008)). “[T]he trial justice’s findings ‘are accorded great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that they are clearly wrong or that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 193). Questions of law, including those of statutory construction, however, are reviewed, as always, de novo. In re Tamika R., 973 A.2d at 550.', 'With respect to this appeal, the contours of our review are altered by the application of both § 1912(d) and (f). Again, § 1912(f) dictates that there will be no termination of parental rights without “a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt[.]” (Emphasis added.) Moreover, § 1912(d) dictates that the “party seeking to effect * * * termination of parental rights * * * shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs[.]” (Emphasis added.) Therefore, when considering a parent’s appeal from a decree terminating parental rights in which those particular provisions of the ICWA are implicated, this Court will first determine whether there exists “legally competent evidence[,]” In re James H., 181 A.3d at 25 (quoting In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d at 202), sufficient to support the trial justice’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that “the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.” Section 1912(f). If so, then it can be said that the parent is unfit.', 'Second, this Court will evaluate whether there exists “legally competent evidence” sufficient to support the trial justice finding “by clear and convincing evidence” that active “efforts at reunification were made by the state agency charged with that duty[.]” In re James H., 181 A.3d at 25 (quoting In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 193); see § 1912(d). While Mother argues that whether active efforts were made is a question of law that should be reviewed de novo, we disagree. Whether there exists evidence sufficient to support a finding of active efforts is within the purview', '- 18 - of the factfinder, who hears the testimony and is uniquely suited to make credibility determinations. See State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 106 (R.I. 2013) (“This Court affords ‘a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama [of the] trial and who has an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’”) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010)). It is also worth noting that the guardian ad litem argues before this Court that all factual findings needed to be made beyond a reasonable doubt when considering both § 1912(d) and (f). This is not quite accurate. While § 1912(f) relating to parental unfitness specifically uses the reasonable doubt language, § 1912(d), involving active efforts, does not. In reviewing whether active efforts were made by DCYF, then, such efforts need only be established by clear and convincing evidence, per our typical review. See In re James H., 181 A.3d at 25.', 'Finally, the Court will evaluate whether “legally competent evidence exists[,]” again to support the trial justice’s finding “by clear and convincing evidence[,]” that the termination is in the child’s best interest. In re James H., 181 A.3d at 25 (quoting first In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d at 202, then In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 193). This three-pronged approach comports with the state’s heightened burden requirement where necessary and ensures fairness to both the parent and the child. In this appeal, Mother contests only the trial justice’s analysis under § 1912(d) and (f). We therefore cabin our review to whether parental unfitness and active efforts were sufficiently proven.11 11', 'While we do not analyze the third prong of this tripartite test, based on the arguments advanced on appeal, an exhaustive review of the record leaves this Court thoroughly convinced that the termination of Mother’s rights is in Roman’s best interest.', '- 19 -', 'Parental Unfitness', 'Mother asserts that the trial justice erred in finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that her continued custody would likely result in serious damage to the child. Mother also argues that no “qualified expert witness” was presented to the trial justice, as Mother insists is required by § 1912(f) of the ICWA.', 'The first argument is one of factual analysis, and the second is a legal matter. We will evaluate the second argument first. As noted supra, § 1912(f) of the ICWA dictates that: “No termination of parental rights may be ordered * * * in the absence of a determination * * * including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child * * * is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.” Regarding Mother’s assertion that there was no “qualified expert witness,” this raises two issues. First, was a “qualified expert witness” required in this case, and, if so, what kind of expert?', 'A plain reading of the ICWA directs that, in every termination of parental rights case under the ICWA, the testimony of at least one qualified expert witness is required to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody is likely to result in serious damage to the child. Section 1912(f).', 'A qualified expert witness is thus required. See Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012) (“It is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.”) (quoting Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009)). The second, and slightly more difficult, question is, in which area must this expert be qualified?', 'The United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, recently promulgated updated guidelines to “promote compliance with ICWA’s stated goals and', '- 20 - provisions[.]” Guidelines for State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146-02 (Feb. 25, 2015). The updated guidelines state that “[a] qualified expert witness should have specific knowledge of the Indian tribe’s culture and customs.” Id. at 10157. The supplementary information explaining updates to the guidelines states that “[c]ommenters indicated that some States rely on witnesses’ qualifications as child care specialists, or on other areas of expertise, but do not require any expert knowledge related to the tribal community” and that “[t]he updated guidelines establish a preferential order for witnesses who are experts in the culture and customs of the Indian child’s tribe” to “ensure that the expert witness with the most knowledge of the Indian child’s tribe is given priority.” Id. at 10149. This clearly suggests that the Bureau of Indian Affairs envisions the “qualified expert witness” to be an individual with expertise in the cultural affairs of the child’s Indian tribe.', 'The guidelines, however, are not binding on this, or any, court. Moreover, it would exceed the bounds of common sense to hold that an expert witness on Indian cultural affairs was necessary to prove that a child’s reunification with a parent was “likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child” when the evidence for and against termination is noncultural. Section 1912(f); see In re Tamika R., 973 A.2d at 552 (suggesting that some grounds for separation may be “sufficiently ‘culturally neutral’ as to vitiate the need for testimony from a qualified expert witness” under § 1912(e)). Simply put, in culturally-neutral termination cases, such as the one before us now, about what would an expert in Indian affairs testify? It is our considered opinion that, while at least one qualified expert witness is necessary under § 1912(f), that expert may be qualified in any relevant area if, as here, the case presents no culturally-relevant issues. In this case, DCYF elicited the testimony of three relevant expert witnesses: Dr. Kristin Lombardi, who testified about Roman’s serious and tenuous medical condition; Ms. Gojcz, a licensed independent', '- 21 - clinical social worker possessing more than a decade of experience, who testified with respect to her parent/child evaluation of Mother and Roman; and Dr. Brian Hayden, who testified about the psychological evaluation that he administered with respect to Mother.', 'This Court is thus convinced that the expert witness component of § 1912(f) was satisfied in this case.12', 'With respect to the trial justice’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Mother’s continued custody would likely result in serious damage to the child, Mother marshals several arguments as to why this finding was in error.', 'She asserts that her own trial testimony demonstrated that she had a comprehensive understanding of the care that Roman requires. She also argues that her ability to care for Roman was supported by a favorable report issued by Ms. Wild, Mother’s first contact at Boys Town of New England. Nevertheless, the trial justice specifically found Mother’s testimony to be lacking in credibility; and a needle or two of favorable evidence reposited in a veritable haystack of unfavorable evidence cannot lead us to say that the trial justice was clearly wrong.', 'Mother further asserts that “[b]oth the parent-child evaluator and the child protection consultant at the Habsro Children’s Hospital Aubin Child Protection Center agreed that Mother understood what was going on medically with Roman.” This statement, however, when viewed in context, is at best misleading and at worst simply untrue. Even though the child protection consultation report says that “Mother showed an extensive understanding of Roman’s condition and asked reasonable and well thought out questions throughout[,]” that same report states: 12', 'The trial justice considered Wenonah Harris, the ICWA Director and Child Advocate for the Narragansett Tribe, to have testified as an expert. We note, however, that, in the main, Ms. Harris provided testimony relating to the notice requirement of the ICWA rather than testimony about whether Roman would be harmed if he remained in the custody of Mother. Therefore, in evaluating whether an appropriate “qualified expert witness” testified under § 1912(d), we do not factor Ms. Harris’s testimony into our analysis.', '- 22 - “[M]other has not been present at the bedside to receive teaching regarding Roman’s medical care including NG tube feeds, his methadone wean and care the wound from the IV infiltrate.” This document clearly cuts both ways.', 'Moreover, our review of the record indicates that the parent-child evaluator at Spurwink, Ms. Gocjz, did not testify that Mother understood what was going on medically with Roman.', 'Lastly, Mother argues that the testimony by Ms. Gocjz and Dr. Hadyen, the clinical psychologist, does not support the conclusion that Roman’s reunification with Mother would create a likelihood of harm to Roman. We are not persuaded by this argument. The question as to whether reunifying Roman with Mother would likely result in harm to Roman is to be determined based on the entirety of the evidence presented to the trial justice. As a review of the testimony and the record in this case reflect, there was an abundance of evidence at trial from which the trial justice could make such a determination. We will not disturb her conclusion.', 'Active Efforts', 'Mother argues that DCYF failed to engage in “active efforts” to reunify Roman with her, as is required by the ICWA in § 1912(d). This Court has yet to examine what constitutes “active efforts” under the ICWA. Some courts may have adopted various phraseologies for determining what such efforts are. See e.g., Dashiell R. v. State, Department of Health and Social Services, Office of Children’s Services, 222 P.3d 841, 849 (Alaska 2009) (“As opposed to passive efforts such as simply developing a plan for the parent to follow, active efforts require that the state actually help the parent develop the skills required to keep custody of the children.”); In re J.S., 177 P.3d 590, 594 (Okla. Civ. App. 2008) (describing active efforts as “leading the horse to water”); Department of Human Services v. D.L.H., 284 P.3d 1233, 1240 (Or. Ct. App. 2012) (“We have defined ‘active efforts’ to ‘impose on DHS an obligation greater than simply creating a', '- 23 - reunification plan and requiring the client to execute it independently. Active efforts means that DHS must assist the client through the steps of a reunification.’”) (brackets omitted) (quoting State ex rel. Juvenile Department of Multonomah County v. T.N., 203 P.3d 262, 263 (Or. Ct. App. 2009)). We need not undertake that type of task here, however, because this Court is satisfied that DCYF’s efforts constituted “active efforts” by any conceivable definition of the term.13', 'While Mother advances several reasons in support of her argument that DCYF did not provide “active efforts” at reunification, each is unavailing. For example, Mother asserts that DCYF “did not seem to have been operating under the impression that ‘active efforts’ were required[,]” and cites to Ms. Sousa’s testimony that she was only “[k]ind of” aware that the ICWA requires “active efforts.” Nevertheless, the knowledge of Ms. Sousa, who is a social worker, as to the requirements of a complicated federal statute that has been the subject of litigation at the Supreme Court does not determine whether the “active efforts” requirement in the ICWA was satisfied in this case. Additionally, Mother’s argument, made both in her brief and at oral 13', 'We observe that on December 12, 2016, less than a month before the trial justice issued her decision in this case, a new federal regulation promulgated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs was made effective, defining “active efforts” under the ICWA:', '“Active efforts means affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intended primarily', 'to maintain or reunite an Indian child with his or her family. Where an agency is involved', 'in the child-custody proceeding, active efforts must involve assisting the parent or parents', 'or Indian custodian through the steps of a case plan and with accessing or developing the', 'resources necessary to satisfy the case plan. To the maximum extent possible, active', 'efforts should be provided in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural', 'conditions and way of life of the Indian child’s Tribe and should be conducted in', 'partnership with the Indian child and the Indian child’s parents, extended family', 'members, Indian custodians, and Tribe. Active efforts are to be tailored to the facts and', 'circumstances of the case.” 25 C.F.R. § 23.2 (2016). This Court is satisfied that, even under this definition, appropriate “active efforts” were made by DCYF in this case.', '- 24 - argument, that the services in the case plans were not tailored, and that she should have been provided access to a special support program at Boston Children’s Hospital related to families with children having heart problems, is also not persuasive. It defies logic, based on the record and facts of this case, to think that Mother would have been an avid participant in DCYF’s services if only she had been referred to this one particular program. Ms. Sousa testified that, at the beginning of the case, Mother felt she was too busy to work with DCYF and, in a conversation that took place in January 2015, Mother again told Ms. Sousa that she was too busy to participate in services. Further, Mother was not successful in meeting case plan requirements such as attending Roman’s medical appointments with regularity.', 'Other arguments that Mother asserts on the issue of active efforts are similarly unpersuasive. They either rely on Mother’s testimony, which the trial justice found to be incredible, or they are outweighed by other facts in the record. The record clearly establishes that DCYF created multiple case plans with the express objective of reunification. Ms. Sousa, the social worker assigned to work on Roman’s case throughout its entirety, made referrals to various resources throughout the case and explained to the Family Court that DCYF would pay for those services when necessary. The trial justice’s findings “that DCYF continued to do more than merely offer a plan to mother and wait for her to act” and that “[t]here was no credible evidence that contradicted the active efforts made by DCYF to reunify Roman with his mother” are not clearly wrong. It is our firm opinion that the trial justice did not err when she found that DCYF had satisfied its burden to show that it made active efforts to attempt to reunify Roman with Mother.', '- 25 -', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the decree of the Family Court is affirmed.

Dissatisfied with the judgment, the defendant filed a timely appeal, raising an array of issues. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. 1 After hearing the arguments of counsel and thoroughly examining the 1', 'After the appeal was docketed in this Court, and upon a motion from plaintiff, this case was remanded to the Family Court for the limited purpose of entering a final judgment as to the divorce. However, our review of the record reveals that the trial justice exceeded the scope of the remand by incorporating a consent order with the final judgment that was entered on remand. The consent order included a modification of the child support award that had been provided in the decision pending entry of final judgment that increased the award from $5,500 per month to “$7,500 per month * * * beginning October 1, 2018 for a six-month period, or until the Supreme Court issues its opinion, whichever occurs first.” “[T]his Court has been clear that ‘lower courts that receive our remand orders may not exceed the scope of the remand or open up the proceeding to legal issues beyond the remand.’” State v.

Here, our order of remand was very specific, and the trial justice should not have expanded the issues on remand. However, because the additional issues that were addressed on remand do', '-1- record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Family Court, and we remand the case to that tribunal for further findings.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff, Adam Saltzman, and the defendant, Erin, were married on September 26, 2009, and two minor children were born of the marriage. 2 Adam filed a complaint for divorce from Erin on July 30, 2015, citing irreconcilable differences that had led to the breakdown of the marriage.', 'At the time of their marriage both parties resided in New York City. During the early days of their marriage in 2009, Erin and Adam were both employed; he as a physician and she as a buyer for Macy’s department store. However, in May 2011, when Adam accepted a two-year fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital, Erin gave up her job and the couple relocated to Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2013, they relocated again, this time to Barrington, after Adam accepted a position at Southcoast Health in Massachusetts. At the time of trial, Adam was the sole breadwinner through his work as a cardiologist, and he earned a salary of $550,000 per year. Erin was the primary caregiver for the children.', 'According to the testimony at trial, the couple began to experience increasing tension in their relationship. The domestic difficulties were no doubt exacerbated by Erin’s frequent trips to not affect the appeal, we need not address this issue any further. At oral argument, both parties made representations that no other issues are currently pending before the Family Court. 2', 'In this case, we refer to the parties as Adam and Erin. This is for the purpose of clarity only because they share the same last name, and we intend no disrespect by using their first names.', '-2- her family’s home in Ohio. During one of those trips, Adam began an illicit relationship with another woman. In fact, in his decision, the trial justice found that Adam had been “less than candid with his responses in deposition testimony and discovery as to his sexual involvement with another woman, which he later modified prior to trial.” Although the trial justice found that Adam’s infidelity ultimately led to the couple’s separation, he also determined that each party had contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.', 'At the end of the proceeding, the trial justice granted the complaint for divorce of each party based on irreconcilable differences that had led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. In his decision pending entry of final judgment, the trial justice awarded the parties joint custody of the minor children, with physical placement with Erin. However, he denied Erin’s request to relocate to Ohio with the children. The trial justice also ordered Adam to pay (1) the costs to maintain the marital domicile for a period of thirty months, at which point the home would be sold; (2) alimony in the amount of $50,000, which would be treated as a contribution towards the costs of maintaining the marital home for thirty months; and (3) child support in the amount of $5,500 per month. With respect to the marital estate, the trial justice ordered that the marital domicile be sold at the expiration of the thirty-month period and that Erin would receive 70 percent of the net proceeds and Adam the remaining 30 percent. The balance of the marital estate was to be divided evenly between the parties. The trial justice also ordered both parties to pay their own attorneys’ fees except for the sanction the trial justice imposed on Adam for his lack of candor. Finally, the court awarded Adam reasonable visitation rights with the minor children, including alternate weekends and overnight visitations on Mondays and Wednesdays. Erin appealed, and we remanded the case for entry of final judgment, which occurred on December 5, 2018.', '-3-', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, Erin argues that the trial justice erred in (1) denying her request to relocate with the children to Ohio; (2) awarding temporary use of the home to her for thirty months, after which the home would be sold; (3) the calculation of child support; (4) the award of attorneys’ fees and costs; (5) the equitable distribution of marital property; (6) setting the visitation schedule; and (7) the amount of sanctions imposed on Adam. We address each issue in turn.', 'A', 'Relocation', 'Erin argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied her request to relocate to Ohio with the minor children. Specifically, Erin asserts that the trial justice failed to adequately consider Erin’s enhanced housing and employment opportunities in Ohio; the short time the children have lived in Rhode Island; the difference in degree of past parental involvement; and the support network available to the children in Ohio, as opposed to the lesser support network available to them in Rhode Island.', 'Standard of Review', '“It is a firmly established principle in family law that the paramount consideration in relocation cases is the best interests of the child or children.” Ainsworth v.

Erin testified at trial that, according to the terms of the offer, she would earn $90,000 per year; but the trial justice found that that fact alone did not demand relocation to Ohio because Erin introduced no evidence that her employment opportunities in Ohio outweighed her opportunities in Rhode Island. Second, the trial justice analyzed the children’s connection to Rhode Island and found that, despite the limited time the children had lived in this state, the court was not convinced that their emotional well-being would be enhanced by a move to Ohio because the children appeared to be “flourishing” in their present environment in Rhode Island.', 'Third, he determined that, although the fact that Erin was the primary caregiver was relevant to the determination of what was in the best interests of the children, he did not limit the analysis governing that determination to the past but he also looked at the current relationship each parent had with the children. See Ainsworth, 186 A.3d at 1084 (holding that it was appropriate for the trial justice to consider a parent’s current status as well as “past misdeeds” when evaluating the best interests of the children). Here, the trial justice found that Adam similarly has a meaningful relationship with the children and that he was determined to maintain that relationship. The trial justice found that the involvement of both parents with their children was both extensive and admirable. Erin has not pointed to any evidence in the record to contradict the trial justice’s findings in that regard.', '-7-', 'Fourth, Erin argues that the trial justice failed to take into account Adam’s considerable income when he discussed the feasibility of the non-custodial parent maintaining a relationship with a relocated child through visitation. 3 However, we have said that “the trial justice need not refer to every piece of evidence, [rather] he must refer to the specific evidence that prompted his decision[.]” H.J. Baker & Bro., Inc. v. Orgonics, Inc., 554 A.2d 196, 202 (R.I. 1989). It is clear that the trial justice’s focus was on the transportation difficulties that would arise from the relocation of the minor children, including bearing the transportation and lodging costs that would be incurred in travelling to Ohio to visit with the children, the ages of the children, and Adam’s current employment obligations. It may be true that Adam’s income may allow him to absorb those costs, but the facts considered by the trial justice are equally relevant and their weight is not diminished by Adam’s enhanced financial condition. Therefore, it cannot be said that the trial justice did not act within his discretion when considering Dupré’s feasibility factor.', 'Finally, we conclude that Erin’s argument that the trial justice failed to consider the lack of a support system available to the children in Rhode Island is wholly without merit. Although the trial justice found that the children would have an extensive support system in Ohio, he also found that the children had a more than sufficient support system in their present circumstances. Erin’s contention that there is no support system in Rhode Island may be technically true, because Adam’s family resides in Massachusetts; however, the trial justice found the distance between the children’s home in Barrington and Adam’s family to be reasonable. Erin has not pointed to anything in the record that would undermine the trial justice’s finding. 3', 'The trial justice made a finding of fact with respect to Adam’s income in another part of his decision.', '-8-', 'In our opinion, the trial justice diligently reviewed all the testimony, thoroughly considered the Dupré and Pettinato factors, and made forty-four findings of fact that were amply supported by the record. As we have held, we accord great deference to the sound discretion of the trial justice in assessing and weighing these factors because “it is the trial justice who is in the best position to determine what factors may be relevant on a case-by-case basis.” Ainsworth, 186 A.3d at 1083 (brackets and deletions omitted) (quoting Dupré, 857 A.2d at 257).', 'Therefore, we can find no fault with the decision of the trial justice when he denied Erin’s motion to relocate to Ohio with the children.', 'B', 'Alimony/Temporary Use of the Marital Home', 'Erin argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in the award of alimony. Specifically, Erin maintains that the trial justice erred not only in the amount of alimony that he awarded, but in the method of payment as well.', 'Standard of Review', '“The grant of alimony is authorized by statute.” Meyer v. Meyer, 68 A.3d 571, 585 (R.I. 2013).

Thompson, 642 A.2d 1160, 1162 (R.I. 1994)).', 'Analysis', 'Erin contends that the trial justice should have awarded a higher amount of alimony to her because of Adam’s significant income as well as the amount of time that she has been unemployed. Because Erin, who has been gainfully employed in the past, has not pointed to anything in the record that would indicate that she would require more than thirty months to secure employment, we are not persuaded by this argument. The trial justice found that she was employable based on her prior work history, earning capacity, health, and age. Indeed, Erin testified that she has a degree in marketing and a job offer from Ohio. Nothing in the record indicates that the trial justice misconceived or overlooked evidence in arriving at that conclusion.', 'With respect to the method of payment of alimony, Erin argues that it was improper for the trial justice to grant temporary use of the former marital domicile to her but also to consider payments from Adam to her to maintain the home to be alimony. We do not agree. Nothing in § 15-5-16 forbids such an arrangement. That statute defines alimony as “payments for the support of either the husband or the wife.” Section 15-5-16(c)(1) (emphasis added).', 'There is no', '- 10 - requirement that the payment be made directly to the spouse. A trial justice is permitted to fashion a proper alimony award in his own discretion to meet the needs of a particular case, so long as the trial justice adheres to the statutory factors. See Meyer, 68 A.3d at 586. The trial justice’s award, which permits Erin to remain in the home while she seeks employment, was within his discretion and was a reasonable method of satisfying the intent of rehabilitative alimony.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial justice acted within his discretion in his alimony award. The trial justice considered all of the statutory factors in reaching his decision and made the relevant findings of fact. Therefore, we will not disturb the trial justice’s award of alimony.', 'C', 'Child Support', 'Erin next argues that the trial justice erred in his award of child support because he did not award the proper minimum child support amount pursuant to the Rhode Island Family Court Child Support Guidelines.', 'Standard of Review', '“We consistently have stated that the guiding principle in setting a child-support award is to balance the needs of the child against the financial ability of the absent parent.” Trojan v.

The Rhode Island Family Court Administrative Order sets the child support amount for a couple with two children and income exceeding $35,000 per month, the highest amount provided in the guidelines, at $4,202 per month. The record reveals that Adam earns $550,000 per year, or about $46,000 per month. Thus, he earns 31 percent more in monthly income than the highest income amount specified in the guidelines. We note that the trial justice’s child support award of $5,500 is approximately 31 percent in excess of the $4,202 set forth in the guidelines for a combined income of over $35,000 per month. In our opinion, this award is well within the discretion of the trial justice, and Erin has failed to point to anything that suggests otherwise. We note that no such proportionality is required in every award of child support. The focus must always be on the needs of the children, the financial ability of the absent parent, and all other relevant factors.

31,State : v. : Michael Neugent. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In this case, we are confronted with a ten-hour police standoff in Hopkinton, Rhode Island, precipitated by a 911 call by the longtime girlfriend of the defendant, Michael Neugent, arising from a domestic dispute. The defendant’s mother—who was also his landlord—provided the responding officer with keys to the defendant’s apartment. The defendant was barricaded inside the dwelling and threatened to shoot the officer if he entered. Within minutes, officers from multiple police departments, including the Rhode Island State Police SWAT team and approximately twenty police vehicles, surrounded the apartment building. After hours of fruitless negotiations, the SWAT team, garbed in full tactical gear and armed with assault weapons and explosives, executed a forced entry into the defendant’s apartment.', 'The defendant struck the first officer who came through the door with an approximately three-foot-long construction level. A brief struggle ensued; and, despite strenuous resistance, the defendant was apprehended. He was later charged with several counts, ultimately being convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest.', '-1-', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 2, 2019, on a writ of certiorari from a judgment of conviction following a jury trial.1 Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial because, he alleges, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence. The parties were directed to appear and show cause why the issues raised in the case should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the case at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 11, 2015, defendant was charged by criminal information, in W2/15-54A, with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count one), and one count of resisting arrest, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 12-7-10 (count two).2 A jury trial commenced on October 25, 2016, and the jury heard from several witnesses, including defendant and his girlfriend. We summarize the testimony presented at trial.', 'Detective John Forbes (Det. Forbes) of the Hopkinton Police Department testified that, on October 11, 2014, he responded to a 911 call from defendant’s longtime girlfriend, Joyce 1', 'Because defendant’s trial counsel failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction, the public defender’s office filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on defendant’s behalf, to which the state had no objection. 2', 'The defendant was also charged by a separate criminal information, in W2/15-70A, with one count of threatening a public official, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-42-4, one count of domestic assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3, and one count of disorderly conduct, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1. The charges of domestic assault and disorderly conduct were dismissed in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after defendant’s longtime girlfriend refused subpoena service, thereby depriving the state of the direct evidence necessary to proceed to trial. The charge of threatening a public official was tried along with the counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest, and the jury found defendant not guilty on that count. Therefore, W2/15-70A is not before us in this case.', '-2- Kreyssig (Kreyssig), about a domestic dispute at a duplex apartment building located at 5 Side Hill Street in the town. Kreyssig told Det. Forbes that she lived with defendant in apartment 5A and that he was the only person in the apartment at that time. She also informed Det. Forbes that there was a .22–caliber rifle in the bedroom.', 'Detective Forbes testified that he proceeded to the common doorway of the building, knocked on the separate inside door for apartment 5A, announced himself as a Hopkinton police officer, and requested that defendant open the door. After receiving no response, Det. Forbes obtained keys to the apartment from defendant’s mother and landlord, Sandra Neugent. When Det. Forbes returned to defendant’s apartment, he unlocked the doorknob; but before he could unlock the deadbolt, he heard someone lock the door from the inside. Detective Forbes again announced himself as a police officer and instructed defendant to open the door. The defendant refused, stating, among other things: “I have a weapon pointed at you through this door. If you come through this door, I’m going to use it on you.” Detective Forbes immediately evacuated the remaining residents in the building, took cover, and called for backup. A phalanx of police officers from the state police and the Hopkinton and Richmond police departments responded to the scene and surrounded the apartment building.', 'Sergeant David Bassignani (Sgt. Bassignani), the commander of the state police SWAT team, testified that, when he arrived, state troopers from the Crisis Negotiation team were communicating with defendant by cell phone. However, at some point, defendant ended all communication. Because the police believed that defendant’s phone was no longer working, the SWAT team approached the house, broke the front window, and tossed a phone in a box—aptly described as a “throw phone”—into the residence. The defendant threw the box back out through the window. He then stood in the broken window, “yelling and screaming” and holding', '-3- an approximately three-foot-long construction level.3 Sergeant Bassignani decided to send in the SWAT team to apprehend defendant.', 'The entry team breached the door and entered defendant’s apartment, announcing their presence by yelling the words, “State Police.” Sergeant Bassignani, who was holding a ballistic shield, entered first and immediately saw defendant, who was wielding the construction level. The defendant swung the level and struck the front of the shield, forcing it against Sgt. Bassignani’s face, causing injury above his right eyebrow. The entry team swarmed defendant, who, Sgt. Bassignani testified, “was in full resist mode.” He was ordered to stop resisting and get on the ground.', 'Corporal Thomas Chabot (Cpl. Chabot) of the state police testified that his role on the entry team was to cover Sgt. Bassignani.4 When the entry team entered the apartment, everyone yelled “State Police[,]” as they do, according to Cpl. Chabot, “prior to entering any residence or upon making entry and crossing any threshold[.]” Although it was dark, Cpl. Chabot saw defendant lunge at Sgt. Bassignani with a long instrument, forcing the shield against Sgt. Bassignani’s face. According to Cpl. Chabot, as they struggled to apprehend him, defendant was agitated and uncooperative.', 'The state rested its case, and defendant called Kreyssig. Kreyssig acknowledged that she had called the police after a dispute with defendant.', 'She testified that she informed the responding officer that defendant was “just pretty miserable.” Kreyssig also informed the officer that there was a gun in the apartment. But, according to Kreyssig, defendant did not know where 3', 'A “level” is “[a]n instrument for ascertaining whether a surface is horizontal, vertical, or at a 45° angle, consisting essentially of an encased, liquid-filled tube containing an air bubble that moves to a center window when the instrument is set on an even plane.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1009 (5th ed. 2011). 4', 'Corporal Chabot was a trooper at the time of the incident.', '-4- the gun was located in the apartment. She testified that she next observed the officer speak with Sandra Neugent, then enter the common doorway of the apartment building. Shortly thereafter, Kreyssig testified, additional police officers arrived at the scene. She testified that she remained at the scene for over ten hours.', 'The next witness, Sandra Neugent, testified that she owns the house located at 5 Side Hill Street, and that her son and Kreyssig live in apartment 5A. She testified that, on October 11, 2014, she spoke with a police officer who asked for keys to the apartment, which she provided. Although she saw the officer enter the house, she did not hear anything that happened inside.', 'The defendant testified last.', 'The defendant testified that, after the couple had a disagreement and Kreyssig left the apartment, he did not hear individuals knock on the door or announce themselves as police. According to defendant, he heard someone put a key in the doorknob, and he immediately “jumped up and locked the door.” He stated that the person told him not to lock the door again, but did not identify himself as a police officer, nor was defendant aware of the police presence or the numerous police vehicles outside his home.', 'The defendant testified that he then began receiving text messages from the state police, but he did not know why. During the exchange of text messages, they requested that he go outside, but defendant refused and stopped responding. Later that night, defendant testified, after an explosion shattered his front window, he saw the throw phone box fly through the window, and he immediately threw it back outside. Less than five minutes later, defendant testified, his door was breached, and he immediately “jumped with the level and swung.”', 'The defendant claimed during his testimony that he did not hear anyone announce themselves as police officers, nor did he receive a warning that the police were coming through the door. After he swung the level, defendant testified, he immediately dropped it and backed', '-5- up, then he was rushed by the entry team. According to defendant, they struck him in the back of the head, tased him, and brought him down to the ground. The defendant testified that he was having difficulty breathing, and he passed out. The defendant testified that, when he regained consciousness, his hands were handcuffed behind his back, and the officers were punching him.', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the counts of the information in W2/15-54A, and not guilty on the remaining count in W2/15-70A. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial that was heard and denied on December 6, 2016. On February 20, 2017, defendant was given a five-year suspended sentence, with probation, on count one, and a concurrent one-year suspended sentence, with probation, on count two. The defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on May 18, 2018.', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a motion for a new trial, this Court accords “‘great weight to a trial justice’s ruling’ when that justice ‘articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.’” State v. Najera, 211 A.3d 938, 943 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011)). If the trial justice complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, “his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” State v. Rogers, 207 A.3d 457, 461 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because, he asserts, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence concerning the charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest. As to the charge', '-6- of assault with a dangerous weapon, defendant contends that he acted in self-defense when he swung the level because he did not know that the individuals who pushed his door in were police officers.5 As to the charge of resisting arrest, defendant asserts that he immediately dropped the level and surrendered when he realized that the individuals in his apartment were police officers. The defendant argues that his injuries were not consistent with that of someone who resisted arrest, his apartment showed no signs of a struggle, and none of the state troopers who arrested him sustained any injuries or damage to their equipment. We deem defendant’s arguments to be without merit and therefore reject them.', 'Under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of justice.” When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice, acting as the thirteenth juror, “must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Lopez, 149 A.3d 459, 462 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011)). If the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if “reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Rogers, 207 A.3d at 462 (quoting State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257, 1260 (R.I. 2009)). Conversely, if the trial justice finds that the state did not meet its burden on the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, a new trial must be ordered. E.g., id.; State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 666 (R.I. 2010).', 'In this case, the trial justice, in his bench decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, summarized the trial testimony, exercised his independent judgment as to the credibility of 5', 'The defendant asserted the defense of self-defense at trial, and the trial justice properly instructed the jury on self-defense and the state’s burden of proof.', '-7- each witness and the weight of the evidence, and declared that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. The trial justice found Sgt. Bassignani to be “very professional” and a “credible witness.” The trial justice also noted that the testimony of Cpl. Chabot was consistent with that of Sgt. Bassignani. By contrast, regarding Kreyssig’s testimony that defendant did not know where the gun was located in the apartment, the trial justice stated: “I don’t believe what she said for a minute. All I believe is that she told * * * [Det.] Forbes that he was in there and he had access to a gun. Anything else was an afterthought after she saw the predicament that her boyfriend got himself into.” Further, he stated that Kreyssig’s testimony in support of defendant’s “ludicrous” defense at trial was, according to the trial justice, nothing but “an effort to defend the indefensible[.]” What is more, the trial justice found that defendant’s “suggestion that [he] didn’t know that there were police outside [who] wanted to arrest him” was “absolutely incredible.” The trial justice further acknowledged defendant’s position at trial that he did not know who was on the other side of his door and did not even look outside, declaring, “I don’t believe it for a second.”', 'Finally, the trial justice concluded that he would have reached the same result as the jury:', '“In the final analysis I find absolutely no fault whatsoever with the', 'jury’s verdict in this case. All things considered, if I were trying', 'the case, myself, without a jury, I would have come to the same', 'conclusions; that is, except for, as I previously mentioned, I would', 'have found him guilty of * * * the threat to public official charge.', 'So for all these reasons, I think the jury did a good job in', 'evaluating the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses, making a', 'realistic common sense assessment of what went on that day, and I', 'think they applied the law as I gave it to them, and I agree with the', 'result[.]”', 'After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial justice complied with the directives contained in Rule 33 and articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion. We therefore afford deference to the trial justice’s findings, mindful that he was a front-row observer', '-8- for all phases of the trial and was in an especially good position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and evaluate the weight of the evidence. E.g., Rogers, 207 A.3d at 462; State v. Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 29-30 (R.I. 2013). The trial justice weighed the evidence establishing that the defendant was aware of the police presence outside his apartment. He found the state’s witnesses to be credible and both the defendant’s and Kreyssig’s testimony to be completely unbelievable. After the trial justice declared that he would have reached the same result as the jury, his analysis was complete. Therefore, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in denying the motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction and remand this case to the Superior Court with our decision endorsed thereon.', '-9- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

Before this Court, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in (1) failing to address the plaintiff’s argument that G.L. 1956 § 13-6-1 violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, and in failing to allow the plaintiff’s longstanding state law tort claims to proceed; and (2) denying the plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint. We directed the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arises out of an incident that allegedly took place on or about April 26, 2010, while plaintiff was held in pretrial detention at the ACI while awaiting trial on numerous counts stemming from a fatal shooting in Providence in 2008. The plaintiff alleged that he was attacked by Rosado, a fellow inmate, and that he suffered lacerations and permanent facial scarring as a result. The plaintiff also alleged that the attack was made possible because, the day before the attack took place, Rosado told Galligan, a correctional officer, that he intended to carry out the attack.', 'According to plaintiff, Galligan then informed various “John Doe” defendants of Rosado’s planned attack.1 Finally, plaintiff alleged that Galligan had abandoned his post for eighteen minutes on April 26, 2010, to afford Rosado the opportunity to carry out the assault.', 'On May 12, 2010, plaintiff was convicted after a jury trial of first-degree murder, felony assault, using a firearm when committing a crime of violence, carrying a pistol without a license, and possession of arms by a person convicted of a crime of violence or who is a fugitive from justice. He was also declared a habitual offender. The trial justice sentenced plaintiff to two mandatory consecutive life sentences, plus an additional twenty-year sentence to be served consecutively to the second life sentence, and two ten-year sentences to run concurrently with the first life sentence. The plaintiff was also sentenced, as a habitual offender, to an additional twenty-five years, to be served after the sentences on the underlying conviction, without the possibility of parole. The plaintiff appealed, and this Court affirmed the judgment of conviction on May 2, 2014. State v.

As part of that initial complaint, plaintiff also alleged several additional common law tort claims, including intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy and joint enterprise resulting in assault and battery, implied breach of warranty, failure to maintain “protective responsibilities[,]” and a violation of plaintiff’s civil rights.', 'On April 11, 2013, with the statute of limitations looming, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding Rosado and Galligan as named defendants, with additional allegations concerning the circumstances under which the alleged incident took place.', 'Significantly, plaintiff alleged the same tort claims that he alleged in his original complaint and did not add any federal or state constitutional claims.', 'The day before the trial’s scheduled start date, the trial justice, sua sponte, raised the issue of § 13-6-1, the civil death statute, based on the fact that plaintiff was serving consecutive sentences of life imprisonment. The defendants immediately moved to dismiss the case in accordance with § 13-6-1, arguing that plaintiff was deemed to be civilly dead and that, therefore, the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims.', 'The plaintiff objected to the motion to dismiss and sought leave to file a second amended complaint. The proposed second amended complaint added a claim alleging violations by defendants under various statutory and constitutional provisions, including 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; article 1, sections 2, 6, and 8 of the Rhode Island constitution, and G.L. 1956 §§ 42-112-1 and 42-112-2 of the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act. Counts two through six of the proposed second amended complaint recited the same tort allegations as in the original and first amended complaints, but more clearly', '-3- assigned responsibility for each tort to specific actors.', 'Following a hearing on July 28, 2016, the trial justice granted defendants’ motion to dismiss based on the civil death statute, but she did not address plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff appealed, arguing before this Court that § 13-6-1 did not require dismissal of his complaint and that the trial justice erred in failing to address his motion to file a second amended complaint. Gallop v. Adult Correctional Institutions, 182 A.3d 1137, 1141-45 (R.I. 2018) (Gallop II).', 'With respect to the civil death statute, this Court declared in Gallop II that the Superior Court had no authority to entertain plaintiff’s action because plaintiff’s civil rights were extinguished by operation of law once his criminal conviction was affirmed. Gallop II, 182 A.3d at 1141. We held that “[t]he statute unambiguously declares that a person such as plaintiff, who is serving a life sentence, is deemed civilly dead and thus does not possess most commonly recognized civil rights.” Id. We decided that the trial justice “prudently and accurately dismissed the case[,]” and we declined to read an exception into the statute for claims alleging a violation of a prisoner’s civil rights. Id. at 1141, 1143.2 We also reiterated the commonly-understood principle that “[r]epeal is the province of the Legislature.” Id. at 1141.', 'Significantly, there was no timely constitutional challenge to the civil death statute, for negligence claims, raised in the Superior Court or this Court; instead, plaintiff’s argument was confined to the federal civil rights actions.

As a result, we 2', 'In arriving at this decision, however, we clarified that the Superior Court was incorrect when it dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Gallop v. Adult Correctional Institutions, 182 A.3d 1137, 1142 (R.I. 2018). Rather than being dismissed for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction, the case should have been dismissed because it would have been “an excess of jurisdiction for the Superior Court to consider plaintiff’s claims when the Legislature has declared [the] plaintiff to be civilly dead.” Id. at 1143 (emphasis added).', '-4- concluded that the complaint had been properly dismissed. Id. at 1143. However, we decided that the “trial justice should have addressed the plaintiff’s second amended complaint before granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss.” Id. at 1144. We noted that “[t]his Court cannot review the trial justice’s decision granting or denying a motion to amend for abuse of discretion if the trial justice has not exercised that discretion.” Id. at 1145. Accordingly, we held that plaintiff was “entitled, at the very least, to a reasoned decision on his motion for leave to file an amended complaint.” Id. We vacated the judgment of the Superior Court and remanded the case with directions to hear and decide plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint. Id. We took no position on the merits of plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint, but we affirmed the dismissal of the first amended complaint. Id.', 'On remand in the Superior Court, plaintiff presented his arguments in reverse order: He first asserted that, because § 13-6-1 is unconstitutional under federal law, his claims should go forward.', 'Alternatively, plaintiff argued that, even if his federal civil rights claims were disallowed, the tort claims should nonetheless proceed because the civil death statute is unconstitutional. As to his motion to file a second amended complaint, plaintiff argued that there would be no extreme prejudice to defendants if the motion was granted, because the proposed second amended complaint merely clarified the tort claims raised in the first amended complaint. The plaintiff also argued in support of a liberal approach to allowing motions to amend. Specifically, plaintiff argued that the amendment should be allowed because the addition of the civil rights claim would not significantly change the content or nature of the complaint and would not require any further discovery.', 'The defendants correctly pointed out that plaintiff’s various federal and constitutional claims were raised for the first time in the proposed second amended complaint and were not', '-5- properly before the trial justice. Although defendants acknowledged that Rule 15(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading should be freely given when justice so requires, they argued that a proposed amendment that results in undue prejudice or is unduly delayed or filed after the movant has had sufficient opportunity to state a claim should give rise to the denial of the motion to amend. Although mere delay is an insufficient ground for denial of a motion to amend a pleading, defendants argued that the delay in the present case was unduly excessive and would result in prejudice.', 'The defendants submitted that plaintiff had sufficient opportunity to raise the new claims in the six years the case was pending, but he had failed to do so and only sought to change the nature of the case from negligence to civil rights and constitutional violations when faced with dismissal on the eve of trial. The defendants also argued that plaintiff had failed to satisfy his burden of showing some valid reason for his neglect and delay in moving to amend the complaint.', 'The trial justice ultimately denied plaintiff’s motion to amend based on “the proximity to the trial, additional significant discovery, and other pleadings needed in lateness of filing the motion[.]” The trial justice determined that “[t]he delay of filing the second amended complaint would result in extreme prejudice to the defendant” because it was filed on the eve of trial, discovery had closed, trial strategy was developed, and witnesses were prepared. Finally, the trial justice determined that plaintiff “failed to establish a reasonable explanation for [his] delay in moving to amend the complaint.” Before this Court, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in failing to address plaintiff’s argument that § 13-6-1 violates the Supremacy Clause, in failing to allow plaintiff’s longstanding tort claims to proceed, and in denying plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint.', '-6-', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has consistently held that “the decision to grant or deny a motion to amend a complaint is within the sound discretion of the hearing justice[.]” Barrette v.

The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice erred in addressing his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint before she addressed the issue of the constitutionality of § 13-6-1. He argues that the civil death statute should have been invalidated first, then his motion to amend should have been granted as to some or all of his state law claims in counts two through six. The plaintiff is mistaken and overlooks the fact that there was no complaint pending before the Superior Court, and, unless the motion to file a second amended complaint was granted, there was nothing for the trial justice to pass upon.', 'Motion to Amend', 'We first address whether the trial justice properly denied plaintiff’s motion to amend. After careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion, and properly denied the motion to amend.', '-7-', 'The standard of review to be applied in evaluating the decision to grant or deny a motion to amend a complaint is well settled, and the focus is whether there was an abuse of discretion by the trial justice.

A lower court “need not grant leave to amend a pleading when doing so would unduly prejudice the nonmoving party[,]” and “the question of prejudice to the party opposing the amendment is central to the investigation into whether an amendment should be granted.” Id.

Both of these factors are present in the case at bar.', 'Again, it is well settled that this Court’s review of a trial justice’s decision to grant or deny a motion to amend a complaint is deferential, and we “will not disturb [the] ruling unless the hearing justice committed an abuse of discretion.” Barrette, 966 A.2d at 1236. However, the courts are not vested with limitless discretion. Hogan v.

Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988)). In evaluating whether the trial justice abused her discretion, we carefully review the record to determine that all material factors have been properly acknowledged and weighed, that improper factors were not relied on, and, generally, that the record demonstrates the trial justice set forth some grounds that support her decision.', 'Our review of the record satisfies us that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial justice. The record reflects that she properly weighed all relevant factors without allocating weight to any improper factor, such as the constitutionality of the statute that was not before her, as discussed infra. There were more-than-adequate grounds to support her decision. The trial justice looked to our well-settled caselaw as the ruling standard for motions for leave to file an amended complaint, and properly applied the facts from the record to arrive at her decision.', '-9-', 'Simply put, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff’s undue delay in seeking the amendment would create substantial prejudice to defendants. Discovery had closed at least eight months earlier, and the inclusion of the new claims would necessitate additional discovery because the statutory claims were different and more complex than the longstanding common law tort claims. Having observed that “the case would really have to start from square one[,]” the trial justice denied the motion “based upon the proximity to the trial, additional significant discovery, and other pleadings needed in lateness of filing the motion[.]” We discern no error.', 'The record establishes that there were ample grounds supporting the trial justice’s decision. We agree that plaintiff’s undue delay in bringing his new claims would create substantial prejudice for defendants, and that no reasonable explanation for the delay was ever provided by plaintiff. In Gallop II, we noted that the Superior Court failed to rule on plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend his complaint for the second time, and held that “[w]e are of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled, at the very least, to a reasoned decision on his motion for leave to file an amended complaint.” Gallop II, 182 A.3d at 1145.

Neither plaintiff nor defendants raised the issue of Rhode Island’s civil death statute and the impact it might have on the case prior to trial. The trial justice raised the issue sua sponte, and she appropriately continued the matter to afford the parties an adequate opportunity to research, brief, and argue the statute’s applicability. The defendants moved to dismiss, and plaintiff opposed that motion and moved to file a second amended complaint.', 'Before this Court in Gallop II, plaintiff argued that the civil death statute is invalid under the Supremacy Clause “to the extent it impairs a plaintiff’s capacity to sue under 42 [U.S.C. §]', '- 11 - 1983 and other civil statutes”—statutes that he failed to name. However, there were no federal civil rights claims before the trial justice when she dismissed the complaint, and none before this Court in Gallop II.', 'The raise-or-waive rule controls this issue, and the narrow exception for a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial is not applicable. Rhode Island’s civil death statute has been on the books since it was enacted in 1909.

The defendant, Christopher Forlasto, appeals from a pretrial order of the Superior Court denying his motion to dismiss one count of first-degree sexual assault on the grounds of double jeopardy and prosecutorial misconduct.1 The defendant also appeals from the same pretrial order granting the state’s motions in limine to exclude certain photographic evidence and to admit evidence of a jury’s prior guilty verdict against the defendant, as well as previously acquitted conduct. This case came before the Supreme Court on October 3, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. 1', 'This Court has consistently held “that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable, even though such an appeal is interlocutory.” State v.

At a jury trial in Washington County Superior Court, two contrasting versions of events were described by defendant and the complaining witness, Jane.2 The nine-day trial included seventeen witnesses, both lay and expert, and a large number of exhibits pertaining to serious allegations of sexual assault by defendant. Additionally, evidence of several surgeries that resulted in a lengthy recovery period for Jane was introduced.', 'After the close of the state’s case-in-chief, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to count one (first-degree sexual assault based on anal penetration). Later, the defense presented its case, the parties rested, and closing arguments were heard by the jury. After the state’s closing argument, defendant objected to what he characterized as an “improper plea to the passions of the jury” when, according to defendant, the prosecutor cried at the end of her closing argument.', 'The trial justice remarked that she had not noticed the prosecutor cry, but she added that the issue had been brought to her attention. The trial justice 2', 'We refer to the complaining witness in this case by a pseudonym to protect her privacy.', '-2- questioned the prosecutor, who admitted that she had become “choked up[,]” but stated that she “didn’t cry.” The trial justice suggested the following curative instruction for the jury:', '“As is the case in many trials, emotions run high. Witnesses', 'become emotional. Sometimes spectators become emotional.', 'Attorneys also can become emotional. You must disregard any', 'display of emotion so that it does not interfere with your ability to', 'decide this case fairly.

We are human and not devoid of emotions;', 'however, you are duty bound not to let passion or prejudice', 'influence you in determining the issues in the case.” The trial justice then asked defense counsel: “Is there something else you suggest?” Defense counsel responded: “No, Your Honor. That’s fine.” The curative instruction was then given to the jury, with no objection.', 'Also during her instructions to the jury, the trial justice informed the jurors that they would be given a verdict form with six questions, one for each of the six remaining counts of the indictment. Each question referred to the specific acts that formed the basis for that particular count. Ultimately, after deliberations, the jury found defendant not guilty on counts two and three, first-degree sexual assault based upon two alleged acts of oral penetration. The jury also found defendant not guilty on count four, assault with a dangerous weapon, which was based on the allegation that defendant had choked Jane with his hands, and count seven, assault and battery, which was based on the allegation that defendant had bitten Jane’s arm. The jury found defendant guilty on count six, assault and battery, which was based on a bite to Jane’s cheek. On count five, first-degree sexual assault based upon anal penetration, the jury deadlocked and did not reach a verdict.', 'Based on the mistrial resulting from the hung jury, the trial justice scheduled a status conference for February 8, 2017, because it was evident that the state would retry defendant on', '-3- the deadlocked count.', 'The state and defendant then filed several pretrial motions.', 'The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the sole remaining count, arguing that double jeopardy barred a retrial of acquitted conduct that arose from the same set of facts previously decided by the jury and further arguing that the prosecutor had engaged in conduct that was intended to cause a mistrial. The defendant also filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any reference to acquitted conduct from the first trial. The state objected to defendant’s motions and moved in limine to permit evidence related to the acquitted conduct. The state filed two additional motions in limine: one to introduce evidence of defendant’s assault conviction (count six) under Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and one to suppress certain photographic evidence under Rule 403.3', 'The trial justice held a hearing on the parties’ motions on May 12, 2017.

The trial justice found that the issues defendant sought to foreclose were not actually litigated by the prior jury’s acquittal in counts two, three, four, and seven, or in the court’s decision as to count one. The trial justice also denied defendant’s motion to dismiss on prosecutorial misconduct grounds, finding that defendant had agreed to a curative instruction and had not moved for a mistrial. The trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine to permit Rule 404(b) evidence of the conduct referenced in acquitted counts one, two, three, and four; however, the trial justice denied the motion as it pertained to the acquitted conduct referenced in count seven.

The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in ordering that facts alleged in the counts for which he was acquitted are admissible into evidence in the retrial of count five, for first-degree sexual assault. According to defendant, the state would be relying on the same facts upon which a jury has already found defendant not guilty, in violation of his right to be free from double jeopardy.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'When a defendant alleges a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it “presents this Court with a mixed question of law and fact.” State v.

One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette VIN: 1G1YY3388L5111488, 695 A.2d 502, 505 (R.I. 1997).

Ciolli, 725 A.2d 268, 270 (R.I. 1999) (quoting One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette, 695 A.2d at 505).', 'The defendant does not allege a violation of any of the three distinct abuses that have been recognized by this Court. The defendant is not being prosecuted for the same offense after an acquittal, because the state seeks retrial for only count five, which resulted in a mistrial. The defendant is not being prosecuted for the same offense after a conviction, and he will not be punished twice for the same offense. The defendant merely asserts that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence would force him to relitigate issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal.', 'The defendant cites to two United States Supreme Court cases, Yeager v. United States, 557 U.S. 110 (2009), and Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), for the proposition that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the state “from relitigating any issue that was necessarily decided by a jury’s acquittal in a prior trial.” Yeager, 557 U.S. at 119. The defendant correctly states that those two cases explained that “‘when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment’ of acquittal, it ‘cannot again be litigated’ in a second', '-6- trial for a separate offense.” Id. (quoting Ashe, 397 U.S. at 443). The defendant, however, does not argue that the jury in the first trial necessarily decided the ultimate issue in count five, which resulted in a deadlocked jury and is the only count for which the state seeks a retrial. Instead, defendant argues that the jury necessarily decided certain issues when they acquitted him on counts two, three, four, and seven, and that admitting that acquitted conduct into evidence, pursuant to Rule 404(b), would force defendant to relitigate those same issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. This argument conflates a double jeopardy contention with one that is evidentiary.', 'We have consistently held that collateral estoppel does not bar the use of acquitted conduct and that such evidence may be admissible. See, e.g., State v. Hewes, 666 A.2d 402, 403 (R.I. 1995); State v. Bernier, 491 A.2d 1000, 1005 (R.I. 1985). “The fact of acquittal goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence.” Hewes, 666 A.2d at 403. Whether defendant’s acquitted conduct is admissible under Rule 404(b) at his retrial on count five is an issue that is not properly before us at this time, as evidentiary issues are matters to be left to the time of trial and do not “fall within the exception * * * which permits a party to appeal, on double jeopardy grounds, before the entry of a final judgment.” State v.

He began by noting that the burden was “on the [s]tate to reasonably satisfy the [c]ourt that the defendant has failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior.”3', 'He noted also that “a so-called 32(f) violation hearing is a civil proceeding and the evidence doesn’t have to rise actually to the level of a criminal offense in order to constitute failing to keep the peace and be of good behavior.”', 'Next, the hearing justice reviewed the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, acknowledging defendant’s statements to police at the time of the incident. He found that defendant “in his own words confirmed [to the police] the fact that he had imprisoned [the complaining witness], by preventing her from leaving 36 Elm Street * * * when he arrived 2', 'For purposes of this opinion, a precise recitation of the sordid details of the acts allegedly committed by defendant is not necessary. Although there was significant, and at some points appalling, testimony from the complaining witness, we do not deem it necessary to delve into the details. 3', 'Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure was amended effective June 21, 2016, after the decision finding defendant a probation violator in the instant case was rendered, to provide that no revocation of probation “shall occur unless the [s]tate establishes by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant breached a condition of the defendant’s probation or deferred sentence or failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” (Emphasis added.)', '-3- there[-]after learning from a co-worker that she had been seen leaving his apartment * * * with somebody[.]” Additionally, the hearing justice noted that defendant, in his own statement to the police, “says he pushes her back inside and makes her go back into the room upstairs where she had already locked the door and prevented her from leaving the apartment[.]” According to the hearing justice, “[t]hat in and of itself, without anything further, would certainly constitute a failure to keep the peace and be of good behavior.”', 'Following a detailed review of the complaining witness’s testimony, the hearing justice noted that she had “readily admitted her issues” and “didn’t try to gild the lily,” and “basically said that [defendant] forced her to do the acts * * * which would certainly constitute a sexual assault under the statute.” He addressed her trip out of the apartment with defendant to a Cumberland Farms store over the weekend, noting that the complaining witness in her testimony had pointed out that the surveillance video showed that she was crying and using her sunglasses to cover up. The hearing justice also addressed defendant’s assertions that, if she believed she was in danger while she was with defendant that weekend, she could have asked for help or gone to the police. However, he found her explanation “to be credible, that she was waiting until Sunday when her father would come[.]”', 'Regarding the complaining witness’s multiple statements to police, the hearing justice found that “[w]hile there are some inconsistencies between the statements, which is certainly to be expected, which is really an indicia of truth or credibility, if the stories matched exactly you would think that they were rehearsed and made up, but they were in all important respects consistent.”', 'The hearing justice found that much of her testimony was corroborated by defendant in his statement to police, as well as by other witnesses. He ultimately found that defendant had certainly “failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior by having or holding', '-4- her against her will, preventing her from leaving 36 Elm Street in his room at the top [of] the stairs[.]” The hearing justice determined that he was “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt as [to] those facts which this [c]ourt found based upon the credible testimony of [the complaining witness].”', 'The hearing justice determined that defendant had approximately fourteen years and five months remaining on the suspended sentence imposed in P1/99-2303A, and he ordered that defendant serve thirteen years of that sentence. Judgment was entered on January 28, 2016. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on February 12, 2016.', 'B', 'Motion to Terminate Imprisonment', 'While his first appeal was pending, defendant filed a pro se motion in the Superior Court to terminate his sentence of imprisonment, asserting at the hearing on the motion that, because the underlying District Court complaint against him concerning the events of June 2015 was dismissed, according to defendant for lack of probable cause, the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 12-19-18(b)(5) mandated that his imprisonment be terminated. The motion was heard before a second hearing justice, sitting in Providence County, who, in response, read from the Rule 48(a) dismissal filed by the state in that underlying case, which stated: “[T]he [s]tate is dismissing these charges in the interest of sparing the victim any further trauma from repeated court appearances. This dismissal shall in no way be construed to imply that the [s]tate indicates a lack of probable cause or any doubt of the culpability of the defendant.” The state objected to defendant’s motion, arguing at that initial hearing that the underlying District Court charges against defendant were dismissed because the state was “satisfied with the sentence as well as sparing the victim of [sic] any further hearing.” The state further argued that defendant had not', '-5- demonstrated any of the five reasons enumerated in § 12-19-18(b) that would mandate that his imprisonment be terminated.', 'The court eventually held an evidentiary hearing.', 'The first witness to testify was assistant attorney general Roger Demers, who was the prosecutor at defendant’s probation- violation hearing. Demers testified, in response to questioning by the defendant, that he could not recall being told by the lead investigator assigned to the case, Detective Jacque Wuest of the Newport Police Department, on the day the probation-violation report was filed, whether there was probable cause to support the underlying criminal charges against defendant. He did, however, “remember seeing that [there was no probable cause to charge him with a crime] in one of her early reports.”', 'After identifying the Rule 48(a) dismissal filed in the District Court case, Demers testified that the state had dismissed the charges against defendant to ensure that the complaining witness would not be put through any more trauma, including, according to Demers, the “trauma of being sexually assaulted by the defendant and the trauma of having to testify about that sexual assault and undergo a fairly lengthy cross-examination, much of it having to do with irrelevant questions.” He testified further that the “main input was from the victim herself” in the state’s decision to dismiss the underlying charges against defendant; according to Demers, the complaining witness “did not want to continue to have to suffer through this.” He testified that there was no doubt in his mind that there was probable cause in the underlying case and that defendant was culpable for the acts alleged.', 'The defendant then called Det. Wuest as a witness, to which the state objected, arguing that only the state had the discretion to dismiss the charges, and, therefore, the testimony of Det.', '-6- Wuest was not relevant. The hearing justice sustained the state’s objection, but he allowed defendant to examine Det. Wuest as an offer of proof.4', 'After hearing the testimony, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision denying defendant’s motion to terminate his sentence of imprisonment. He found that only the state had the authority to decide whether to proceed with or dismiss the charges, based upon the input of the complaining witness; ultimately, the hearing justice noted, it is the attorney general who has the final say. He found that Det. Wuest’s testimony was not relevant to the determination of probable cause but that, even if it was, “what she initially said about probable cause was later retracted, at least implicitly[.]”', 'The hearing justice concluded by stating that “given the strictures of [§] 12-19-l8(b)(5), the [c]ourt finds that Mr. Demers’ testimony is very, very credible,” and that there was “nothing the [c]ourt heard by way of cross, redirect or recross, or anything — in the event the [c]ourt was in error and should have considered Detective Wuest’s testimony, there is nothing that undercut Mr. Demers’ very credible testimony.” He therefore denied defendant’s motion.', 'An order was entered denying defendant’s motion to terminate imprisonment. The defendant filed a premature but timely notice of appeal on August 2, 2017.5 4', 'Although the testimony of Det. Wuest was an offer of proof and not admitted into evidence, it is important to note that while Det. Wuest testified that initially there was not enough probable cause to charge, once she conducted an investigation, the police “determined there was enough probable cause to charge, and the AG agreed with us, so we charged.” 5', 'This Court has consistently considered a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of the judgment or order appealed from to be timely. See, e.g., State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1252 n.2 (R.I. 2010) (holding that “[a]lthough [the] defendant’s notice of appeal was premature, it was nevertheless valid”); Otero v.

Importantly, the hearing justice noted that defendant himself, in his statements to police, corroborated portions of the complaining witness’s story that supported a finding that he had breached the peace, in particular that he had pushed her back inside and prevented her from leaving the apartment. It is clear to us, based upon our review of the record, that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when he made his finding that the complaining witness was a credible witness.', 'The defendant also asks this Court to remand this case for a new probation-violation hearing utilizing the new burden of proof contained in Rule 32(f), given that the new standard', '-9- was enacted while the violation adjudication was pending direct review in this Court. He argues that the state is now required to prove by a “fair preponderance of the evidence” that defendant had breached a condition of his probation by failing to keep the peace. However, a review of the record reveals that the hearing justice, when rendering his bench decision on the probation violation, stated that he was “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt as [to] those facts which this [c]ourt found based upon the credible testimony of [the complaining witness].” It goes without saying that the standard of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt is a higher standard than either the fair preponderance of the evidence standard or the reasonable satisfaction standard, and that, as such, there is no question that the “fair preponderance of the evidence” standard would have been met in this case.
