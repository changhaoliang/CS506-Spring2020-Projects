0,: v. : Paul A. Anderson. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case is before the Court on appeal by the plaintiff, Dennis D. Bossian (plaintiff), from the grant in the Superior Court of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant, Paul A. Anderson (defendant). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 7, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This dispute centers on a three-count complaint that plaintiff filed against defendant (one of his former law partners) on February 17, 1999. The litigation spawned by the dissolution of that law practice, which took place on June 1, 1999, has been extensive. Much of the procedural history and facts germane to this case can be found in In re Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 974-75 (R.I. 2006), and Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1026 (R.I.', '-1- 2010). We set forth only the facts and travel pertinent to the resolution of the challenges plaintiff raises on appeal.', 'The plaintiff‟s complaint against defendant alleged a variety of causes of action arising from their acrimonious parting as former law partners: (1) intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, (2) defamation, and (3) corporate opportunity doctrine.1 Nearly three months after he filed the action, plaintiff amended the complaint to include a fourth count, conversion.2', 'The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the conversion claim on the ground that res judicata defeated the claim because that count had been the subject of a lengthy trial in the dissolution action. On June 29, 2007, summary judgment was granted by the trial justice, who agreed that the conversion claim was, in fact, barred by res judicata. This Court affirmed the dismissal of that count. Bossian, 991 A.2d at 1027.', 'In this case, we are called upon to review the judgment that entered against plaintiff on the remaining counts in his 1999 complaint. A protracted trial took place over seven days in May of 2011, in which the three remaining counts were tried before a jury. Those counts alleged: (1) intentional interference by defendant with contractual relations between plaintiff and Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) and a subsequent loss of income and business relationship with Allstate; (2) defamation by way of statements allegedly made by defendant to employees and agents of Allstate; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty by defendant in 1998, in an “avaricious and surreptitious scheme * * * to deprive the [p]laintiff from the prospective and on-going 1', 'A bench trial in the dissolution case, which took place between November 2002 and April 2003, resulted in the trial court issuing a written decision distributing the assets of the partnership. The plaintiff appealed that decision, which was affirmed by this Court. In re Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 978 (R.I. 2006). 2', 'In the amended complaint, plaintiff also retitled count 3 “Breach of Fiduciary Duty.”', '-2- professional and business relationship with Allstate * * *, and in order to divert those business opportunities to himself.” Judgment as a matter of law entered on these claims after the trial justice ruled that plaintiff had failed to prove that he suffered any damages arising from these alleged torts and that the claim for defamation failed as a matter of law.', 'On May 12, 2011, plaintiff testified about the damages he claimed to have suffered.3 The plaintiff testified that he vacated the offices of his former law partnership in July 1999 and opened a sole proprietorship on August 2, 1999. Additionally, he testified that, in September 1999, he withdrew his appearance from several Allstate cases after having been told, during the course of the partnership, that he was not to handle those cases. He testified that, as a result, he suffered a loss of $49,914.50 in compensation from those cases. That figure was derived from plaintiff‟s exhibit No. 31, a document prepared for purposes of the dissolution trial, which purported to delineate the legal work plaintiff and his former partners had performed for Allstate between June 1, 1999, and September 1, 1999, after the date of dissolution of the partnership. It was plaintiff‟s contention that the decision in the dissolution case did not contemplate or include those earnings.', 'Additionally, plaintiff alleged that he suffered damages associated with opening his law office in August 1999; according to plaintiff, those damages included rent, electricity, and other costs. He also testified that he was forced to sell his home and had to live at his mother‟s house, and that he had incurred expenses resulting from an Internal Revenue Service investigation. The plaintiff did not specifically quantify any of these expenses. Significantly, when plaintiff was asked whether he had suffered any other monetary damages, plaintiff responded, “No.”', 'With regard to nonmonetary damages, plaintiff testified that he had suffered “[l]oss of 3', 'We note (1) that plaintiff was represented by counsel at trial only for the limited purpose of eliciting plaintiff‟s direct-examination testimony and (2) that he appeared pro se in this Court.', '-3- reputation to this day.” He testified that he had never been rehired by Allstate and had applied for various positions and had been rejected.', 'Then, when asked if there were any other components of damages, either monetary or reputational, plaintiff again answered, “[N]o.” The trial justice then inquired whether, “[s]eparate and apart from cross[-examination of plaintiff], [there was] any additional direct testimony that [plaintiff] wish[ed] to present to [the judge] and to the jury on the issue of damages[,]” and plaintiff answered, “No, your Honor.” Notwithstanding that response, plaintiff later asserted that he had intended to introduce several documents, including several applications for employment and letters sent by employers in response to his inquiries. The trial justice asked whether there were any other documents he intended to introduce, and plaintiff responded that there were various tax returns from 1994 to 1997.4 In an effort to further clarify, the trial justice asked whether plaintiff had other witnesses who would “testify with respect to the documents [he had] proffered[,]” and plaintiff answered, “No.” When the trial justice then asked whether plaintiff planned to call “further witnesses[,]” plaintiff responded that, unless he needed to “authenticate the other documents * * *, no, your Honor.”', 'At the conclusion of plaintiff‟s cross-examination, defendant moved to exclude all evidence of damages. The trial justice instructed plaintiff to “prepare[] to argue * * * legally how [his] damage evidence is relevant and if there is any additional evidence or testimony relative to [his] damages case[.]” The next day, defendant again moved to disallow all evidence of damages, asserting that the liability case had concluded and that there was no further evidence of damages. The trial justice asked plaintiff if there was any more evidence that he intended to present beyond his own testimony, and plaintiff answered for the fourth time that other than the 4', 'An appraisal form for 215 Spencer Avenue, Warwick, Rhode Island, and other tax documents from 1994 to 2000 were also marked as exhibits.', '-4- possible authentication of a single exhibit, if necessary, he had “no testimonial or documentary evidence.” Before proceeding with argument on the motion, defendant clarified that the motion was made based on “the understanding of the defense that the testimony with respect to liability is complete[.]” The trial justice asked plaintiff, “[I]s that conceded?” The plaintiff replied, “Yes, Judge.”', 'In arguing to exclude plaintiff‟s evidence of damages, defendant pointed to exhibit No. 31, as the only evidence offered in support of plaintiff‟s claim for $49,914.50 of lost income. The defendant argued that the $49,914.50 damage claim was “a claim of the dissolution case” and that judgment in that case was acknowledged as fully satisfied. The record reflects that, in the dissolution case, a stipulation was entered, signed by all parties, that judgment was satisfied and the case was dismissed with prejudice. Accordingly, defendant argued that this portion of plaintiff‟s damages claim had been litigated and could not be raised again because it was barred by res judicata.', 'Furthermore, defendant argued that expert testimony was required to prove the value of the services allegedly performed and that the best evidence of those amounts would be the firm‟s invoices, but those documents were not before the court. Therefore, defendant concluded that “there [was] simply no foundation as a matter of law for the claim of monetary damages.”5', 'At this point, despite his earlier statements, plaintiff asserted that he had not completed the testimony as to some of his claimed damages, a position the trial justice noted was “contrary to [his] earlier representation.” The plaintiff argued that he “had just started to identify certain documents that were in [his] blue folder” about the sale of his home and his efforts to offset 5', 'In addition to his argument that res judicata barred this evidence and that the exhibit was inadmissible because it lacked any evidentiary foundation, defendant also argued that it was not disclosed in plaintiff‟s answers to discovery. The trial justice did not address this argument. We deem it unnecessary to our decision and likewise decline to address it.', '-5- damages. The plaintiff acknowledged that in the dissolution case he had sought a ruling on the admissibility of exhibit No. 31, but that the court refused to address any issue of tortious interference or defamation in that case.', 'Next, the trial justice inquired whether it was plaintiff‟s position that reputational damages were recoverable for any claim other than slander per se, and plaintiff argued they were awardable on the claims for intentional interference with contract and breach of fiduciary duty, but he could not cite any case law to support that proposition. The plaintiff indicated that his claim of slander per se was based on defendant‟s alleged use of the term “smoking gun.”6', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel, the trial justice issued a bench decision. She began by stating that, as she had “feared from the outset of this protracted trial, plaintiff‟s damages case [was] largely, if not wholly, unsustainable.” She found that the evidence was “insufficient as a matter of law to prove damages” arising from the alleged tortious conduct of defendant. Additionally, she stated that, in the dissolution case, the trial justice had found “that no partner had an economic interest in the ongoing work of the partnership after [June 1, 1999]”; accordingly, she concluded that the dissolution case had “been terminated by the final judgment to which the plaintiff consented[,]” and that plaintiff was barred by principles of res judicata from pursuing any claim for payment of legal services allegedly performed during or after the dissolution. The trial justice further found that plaintiff had offered no evidence establishing which partner worked on the files, “when the work was performed, when the work was billed or when or if the bill was paid.” 6', 'In his submissions to this Court, plaintiff represents that an October 21, 1998 letter written by plaintiff and sent to Allstate—with a blind copy sent to opposing counsel—was referred to by defendant as a “smoking gun.” Apparently, this letter led to the dissolution of the partnership. The plaintiff contends that the phrase “smoking gun” was slander per se and that the claim should have been submitted to the jury.', '-6-', 'As to plaintiff‟s claim for damages resulting from establishing a new law practice, the trial justice concluded that none of those expenses were quantified; no expert economist testified as to the reasonableness of those expenses; and, critically, that plaintiff had failed to establish a causal nexus between defendant‟s allegedly tortious conduct and the claimed damages. Consequently, the trial justice found that the evidence presented “failed to prove those damages with reasonable certainty,” and it was “clearly impermissible to allow such evidence to be put before the jury for speculative purposes.”', 'Finally, the trial justice declared that “[d]amages for loss of reputation are not awardable absent proper quantification as a matter of law with respect to the torts alleged[,]” with the possible exception of the allegation of slander per se arising from the “smoking gun” statement. Therefore, plaintiff‟s damages evidence was inadmissible on his claims for intentional interference with contractual relations and breach of fiduciary duty.', 'The trial justice next turned to the defamation count and the issue of the “smoking gun,” which was based on defendant‟s alleged characterization of a letter to Allstate about a case pending in Superior Court that was penned by plaintiff, with a blind copy sent to opposing counsel, who moved for sanctions against Allstate. The plaintiff explained that defendant had repeatedly used the term “smoking gun” to describe the letter and, although it was irrelevant whether this statement was conveyed to Allstate, plaintiff argued that the letter amounted to “slander per se to any third party * * *.” He then undertook a long argument in which he narrated instances of various meetings and interactions with other attorneys. It was plaintiff‟s contention that the use of the term “smoking gun” was a false statement that called into question his “propriety or ethics[.]”', 'The trial justice then set forth the case law and elements of defamation and slander per se.', '-7- She noted that, in the absence of a statement that was defamatory per se, plaintiff must prove that he was damaged by the statement. The trial justice indicated that, although a question remained as to whether defendant had, in fact, made the “smoking gun” statement, even if he had done so, she was “hard pressed to find that statement to be defamatory as a matter of law.” She also found that plaintiff had failed to offer evidence regarding the manner in which the statement was conveyed or the context in which it was made. The trial justice concluded that, because the slander claim “fail[ed] as a matter of law,” no evidence of reputation damages was admissible, and, therefore, defendant‟s motion in limine was granted.', 'At this point, the parties and the trial justice engaged in yet another colloquy about the stage of the trial. The plaintiff immediately responded that he had not “even testified yet” or rested his case, nor had he testified to some of the matters the court had referenced. The defendant interjected that plaintiff had rested as to liability, and the court agreed; nevertheless, plaintiff continued to argue with the court. The defendant then moved for judgment as a matter of law on the remaining claims in accordance with Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Again, plaintiff was adamant that he had not rested his case. The trial justice observed that plaintiff had “represented that all of [his] damage evidence and all of [his] liability evidence was complete.”', 'After yet another argument from plaintiff with respect to what he considered “an abundance of evidence to support [his] case * * *,” the trial justice concluded that plaintiff had “failed to present sufficient evidence of damages as required by the law[,]” and she dismissed the case pursuant to Rule 50. Judgment entered on May 13, 2011.', 'On May 26, 2011, plaintiff filed a motion for new trial in accordance with Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff argued that the trial justice erroneously', '-8- had “morphed [defendant‟s] motion in limine into a dispositive motion” and, according to plaintiff, because he had not been fully heard and had not rested as to damages, the court‟s dismissal of the case on a Rule 50 motion was “a clear error of law.” Although plaintiff‟s memorandum was a verbose recitation of his view of the trial proceedings, it provided no support for his claims of damages, the failure of which was the basis for the trial justice‟s dismissal of the case. The defendant objected to plaintiff‟s motion and filed a memorandum.', 'Without further oral argument, the court entered an order denying plaintiff‟s motion for new trial based on the memoranda submitted by the parties. The order stated that plaintiff‟s motion was “procedurally improper as [the] [c]ourt [had] terminated [p]laintiff‟s case through the entry of Judgment as a Matter of Law in favor of [d]efendant pursuant to Rule 50 * * *.” However, the order erroneously noted that “[t]he 1995 amendment to Rule 59 (a) * * * [did] not * * * allow the [c]ourt to revisit its ruling on the Rule 50 motion at trial.” The order concluded that, even if the motion was not barred procedurally, it did not advance any justification for a new trial because “[p]laintiff was „fully heard‟ on the issue of damages * * * and [the] [c]ourt properly determined, before entering [the] [j]udgment, that there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [p]laintiff.” The plaintiff appealed.7', 'On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the trial justice erred: (1) in concluding that damages for 7', 'The defendant moved to dismiss plaintiff‟s appeal, asserting that the notice of appeal was not timely. The plaintiff objected to that motion, arguing that his motion for new trial was proper as he had never rested his case before the trial justice and that, therefore, her grant of defendant‟s motion for judgment as a matter of law was improper and, accordingly, his timely motion for new trial tolled the filing period for his appeal. This Court entered an order on October 12, 2012, deferring consideration of defendant‟s motion and directing the parties to address the issue of whether “legal errors allegedly committed by the trial justice in deciding defendant‟s [Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure] Rule 50 motion are properly reviewable by this Court in the context of the plaintiff‟s instant appeal from the denial of his new trial motion” in light of this Court‟s order in Marcello v. K-Mart Corp., 712 A.2d 882 (R.I. 1998) (mem.). Based on our decision denying plaintiff‟s appeal, we need not address this issue.', '-9- loss of reputation were not awardable; (2) in finding that the term “smoking gun” was not slanderous per se; and (3) in failing to submit his claim of breach of fiduciary duty to the jury.', 'Discussion', 'We first address the issue of whether a motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 59 is proper when a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 has been entered. The plaintiff argues, and defendant concedes, that a trial justice may review legal errors committed in considering a Rule 50 motion. See Marcello v. K-Mart Corp., 712 A.2d 882, 883-84 (R.I. 1998) (mem.) (when the plaintiff moved for a new trial due to errors of law arising from the grant of the defendant‟s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, this Court concluded that the trial justice did not err when he reviewed the alleged errors and granted the motion for new trial). We are satisfied that Rule 59 permits a trial justice to grant a motion for new trial when confronted with errors of law committed during the trial. Id. at 884.', 'In our judgment, although the trial justice erred in concluding that she was procedurally barred from reviewing any alleged errors of law in the context of plaintiff‟s motion for new trial, this circumstance is of little assistance to plaintiff. The decision in this case rests not on an error of law, but on a failure of proof.', 'This Court reviews “a trial justice‟s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.”', 'Lett v.

Accordingly, we “examine „the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.‟” Dawkins v.

Machala, 685 A.2d 258, 262 (R.I. 1996).', 'Before this Court, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred when she granted judgment as a matter of law because plaintiff had not rested his case. This contention wholly is lacking in merit. The record is replete with numerous instances in which plaintiff—an attorney and officer of the court—unequivocally declared that he “[had] no [further] testimonial or documentary evidence” to present as to damages, with the possible exception of authenticating an exhibit. It is equally clear that there was no further testimony to introduce as to liability. The plaintiff is an experienced trial attorney who is more than familiar with the dynamics of a trial. Because he repeatedly responded that he had no further evidence as to liability and damages, he cannot complain that he was taken at his word.', 'On appeal to this Court, plaintiff has not pointed to a single piece of evidence— documentary or testimonial—that could change the result of this case. Rule 50(a)(1) makes clear', '- 11 - that the court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law when “a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue * * *.” Because we are satisfied that plaintiff was fully heard—as he conceded several times in open court—on the issue of damages, we conclude that plaintiff‟s claim of error is without merit.', 'Specifically, as to plaintiff‟s alleged reputation damages for tortious interference with contract, plaintiff avers that the trial justice erred when she found that damages for loss of reputation in a claim for tortious interference with contract must be properly quantified. The plaintiff contends that the trial justice overlooked our opinion in D‟Andrea v. Calcagni, 723 A.2d 276 (R.I. 1999). We disagree.', 'To prevail on a claim of tortious interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff must establish “(1) the existence of a contract; (2) the alleged wrongdoer‟s knowledge of the contract; (3) his [or her] intentional interference; and (4) damages resulting therefrom.” Ims v. Town of Portsmouth, 32 A.3d 914, 925-26 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Tidewater Realty, LLC v. State, 942 A.2d 986, 993 (R.I. 2008)); see also Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, No. 2010-230-A., slip op. at 12 (R.I., June 18, 2013). “The existence of a contract is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.” Ims, 32 A.3d at 926 (citing Nonnenmacher v. City of Warwick, 722 A.2d 1199, 1202 (R.I. 1999)). In addition to these requirements, a “plaintiff must show that the interference is not only intentional, but also „improper.‟” Id. (quoting Tidewater, 942 A.2d at 993); see also Avilla v. Newport Grand Jai Alai LLC, 935 A.2d 91, 98 (R.I. 2007). Importantly, “[t]his Court has recognized that interference with a contractual relationship is an action sounding in tort” and, as such, damages may include: “(a) the pecuniary loss of the benefits of the contract * * *; (b) consequential losses for which the interference is a legal cause; and (c) emotional distress or', '- 12 - actual harm to reputation, if they are reasonably expected to result from the interference.” D‟Andrea, 723 A.2d at 278 (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 774A at 54-55 (1979)).', 'Before this Court, plaintiff provided transcripts of selected excerpts from the trial proceedings on May 12 and May 13, 2011. However, omitted from the record on appeal is the liability portion of the trial. Our review of plaintiff‟s testimony on this claim is therefore limited. In any event, we agree with the trial justice‟s observation that the claim fails because the primary evidence of damages plaintiff sought to introduce—exhibit No. 31, which purportedly listed the Allstate cases and the fees allegedly earned after the dissolution—had been offered and excluded by the trial justice in the dissolution case. There was no appeal from that ruling. We have held that any claims decided by the trial court that are not raised by an appellant in this Court are deemed waived for purposes of the appeal before us and throughout future proceedings. Stebbins v. Wells, 818 A.2d 711, 720 (R.I. 2003) (citing James J. O‟Rourke, Inc. v. Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island, 478 A.2d 195, 198 n.4 (R.I. 1984)).', 'Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the exhibit was of dubious evidentiary value. The business relationship of the parties terminated on June 1, 1999. The plaintiff failed to show how the Allstate cases were managed after that date, who performed the work on any given case, and who, if anyone, received payment. The plaintiff neglected to proffer evidence as to whether the $49,914.50 in claimed revenue set forth in exhibit No. 31 was distributed to the other partners. The other damages that plaintiff claims to have sustained—rent, sale of a home, expenses associated with opening a new practice—were never quantified, nor did plaintiff establish that these so-called damages were the result of any tortious conduct by defendant. We therefore are satisfied that the trial justice did not err when she rejected this claim.', 'Turning to the count alleging defamation, plaintiff also asserts that the trial justice was', '- 13 - mistaken in her conclusion that the phrase “smoking gun” did not constitute slander per se and that the trial justice invaded the province of the jury when she disposed of this claim. We disagree. “To prevail in a defamation action, a plaintiff must prove: „(a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (b) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and (d) damages, unless the statement is actionable irrespective of special harm.‟” Marcil v.

Rhode Island Public Employees Council 94, 516 A.2d 1339, 1342 (R.I. 1986) and Restatement (Second) Torts § 558 at 155 (1977)). “To be actionable as slander per se—without proof of special damages—the false statement must impute to the other: (1) a „criminal offense,‟ (2) a „loathsome disease,‟ (3) a „matter incompatible with his business, trade, profession, or office,‟ or (4) a „serious sexual misconduct.‟” Marcil, 936 A.2d at 212 (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 570 at 186).', 'Assuming, without deciding, that defendant described plaintiff‟s October 21, 1998 letter to Allstate and copied to opposing counsel as a “smoking gun,” it is our opinion that this phrase does not rise to the level of slander per se. At best, the term described the letter and not plaintiff. The term “smoking gun” is defined as “[a] piece of physical or documentary evidence that conclusively impeaches an adversary on an outcome-determinative issue or destroys the adversary‟s credibility.” Black‟s Law Dictionary, 1516 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). The description of the letter does not impute to plaintiff any of the four specific categories of false statements that qualify as slander per se. As the trial justice noted, plaintiff presented “no evidence of the verbal context in which the statement was allegedly made or how it was understood by its listeners.” We are satisfied that the trial justice properly dismissed this claim.', 'The plaintiff‟s final claim—breach of fiduciary duty—comes before us on plaintiff‟s', '- 14 - challenge to the trial justice‟s decision not to allow the claim to go before the jury.

On September 29, 2010, a street fight erupted among several women in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.', 'The fracas was viewed by a large throng of onlookers, including one group consisting of Claudio Nieves (Nieves) and his friends and another comprising the defendant, Blake Covington, and his companions. After the street fight, tensions between these two groups remained high. This animosity culminated in a shooting that left Nieves paralyzed. The defendant was identified as the gunman.', 'The defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for multiple counts of felony assault and of using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and one count of carrying a pistol or revolver without a license. On appeal, defendant launches a three-pronged attack on his conviction. First, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in admitting a statement Nieves made to police shortly after he was shot. Second, defendant argues that the trial justice deprived him of his right to present a full defense by precluding him from presenting his third-party- perpetrator evidence.', 'Lastly, defendant claims that the trial justice erred when he denied defendant‟s motion for a new trial. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Early in the evening of September 29, 2010, Nieves called his two friends, Joel Luis (Luis)1 and Johnny Ortega (Ortega), for a night of drinking. At approximately 7 p.m., Luis and Ortega picked up Nieves, and the three men travelled to Ortega‟s apartment in the Prospect Heights housing complex in Pawtucket. As the group drank beers in front of Ortega‟s apartment, several women began to engage in a fight in the street. Nieves and his friends watched the fray unfold until the police arrived, stopped the fight, and ordered the onlookers to disperse.', 'After the street fight, Nieves, Luis, and Ortega decamped to Ortega‟s backyard. While there, the group spotted Yamirca Arias (Arias), Luis‟s relative or friend,2 and two other women in the backyard of Arias‟s building. Nieves and his friends joined them, and the drinking continued. As the evening progressed, the group‟s supply of beer dwindled, and Nieves and Ortega departed for the liquor store in order to replenish their stock. Upon their return at approximately 11 p.m., Nieves and Ortega learned that, in their absence, three men had entered the backyard and hostile words had been exchanged with the partygoers. Approximately one hour later, two of them returned; Arias recognized Jerry Jones (Jones) and later identified the other man as defendant.', 'The two groups immediately resumed their earlier contentious encounter. According to Arias, Luis grabbed Jones and demanded that he explain why he had disrespected Arias. Jones and Ortega then exchanged angry words, which escalated to the brink of a physical showdown when each of the men grabbed a glass bottle and positioned himself for a fight. 1', 'The record is unclear on Luis‟s first name; at times, he is referred to as “Joel” and, at others, as “Yoel.” 2', 'Nieves testified that Arias and Luis are cousins. Although Arias also referred to Luis as her cousin, she clarified that Luis actually is her brother‟s cousin and not her cousin.', '-2- Ortega cornered Jones against the wall of the apartment building, but he eventually backed down, and no blows were exchanged. Nieves then asked Jones whether he was okay, and Jones responded by shoving Nieves. Nieves then swung a knife at Jones, and Jones walked away. Although tensions appeared to abate, peace was fleeting; Jones stormed back, and Luis declared, “[H]e‟s going to get us, and I‟m going to be the one to give it to him.”', 'Arias testified that, up until this point, defendant‟s role was somewhat peripheral.3', 'As Jones again approached the group, however, defendant assumed a more prominent posture. The defendant was armed with a firearm and began firing several shots at the group. Three shots hit Nieves, and he fell to the ground. As defendant turned the gun on Luis and Ortega, the two promptly fled the scene, with defendant firing at Luis as he ran away. The defendant also fired in the direction of Arias, who took shelter behind a wall. The defendant, who was wearing boots, repeatedly kicked the wounded Nieves in the head as he lay on the ground. During this attack, Arias periodically would come out from behind the wall; and, each time, defendant would aim his weapon, causing her to retreat. The defendant placed the gun against Nieves‟s head and pulled the trigger; however, the empty weapon did not fire. When Arias told defendant that the police were coming, he ran off.', 'Arias testified that Jones performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until Nieves began to stir, at which point he too fled.', 'At approximately 12:10 a.m. on September 30, 2010, Pawtucket police Patrolman Justin Jesse (Ptlm. Jesse) responded to the scene. Patrolman Jesse asked Nieves what had happened. Nieves, who was drifting in and out of consciousness, had difficulty responding, but he was able to say, “Tell my father that I love him.” Nieves ultimately survived the shooting, but he was rendered a paraplegic as a result. He testified that he still has a bullet lodged in his spinal cord. 3', 'Contrary to Arias‟s testimony, Nieves testified that it was Jones and defendant, and not Jones alone, who were arguing with Ortega and Luis.', '-3-', 'When Arias first spoke with the police, she told them that her name was Elizabeth Amporo. At trial, she testified that Elizabeth Amporo also is her name, although she generally is known as Yamirca Arias; she added that she had used her other name because she was afraid. She identified defendant from a photo array as the shooter. Approximately one week after he had been shot, Nieves also identified defendant as his assailant.', 'The defendant was charged, by way of criminal information, with a host of offenses, including: assault with intent to murder Nieves (count 1); three counts of felony assault of Nieves (counts 2, 3, and 6); three counts of using a firearm while committing a crime of violence (counts 4, 8, and 10); discharging a firearm within a compact area (count 5); felony assault of Arias (count 7); felony assault of Ortega (count 9); and carrying a pistol or revolver without a license (count 14).4', 'Prior to trial, defendant moved in limine to exclude, under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, Nieves‟s statement to the police, “Tell my father that I love him.” The defendant argued that the statement was not probative of any issue in the case and was highly prejudicial because of the danger that it would evoke an emotional response from the jury. The trial justice denied defendant‟s motion, explaining that the statement was relevant to show that Nieves knew he was injured and appreciated the seriousness of his injuries. The trial justice also found that there was no undue prejudice arising from the statement because it did not implicate defendant in the attack and the contention that the statement would result in an emotional 4', 'Counts 1, 3, 5, 9, and 10 were dismissed by the state under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-4- response from the jurors overlooked the fact that Nieves would be testifying from a wheelchair— an equally emotional circumstance.5', 'The defendant also sought to introduce evidence tending to show that Jones, and not defendant, was the shooter. In an evidentiary proffer to the trial justice, defendant asserted that Delon Jones (Delon), Jones‟s cousin, would offer testimony showing: that Jones had been involved in the street fight earlier in the evening of September 29, 2010; that Jones‟s niece was an active participant in that fight; and that Jones was very upset after that fight took place. Although the trial justice ruled that defendant would be allowed to show that Jones was angry earlier in the evening, he remained skeptical of whether defendant had stated a valid third-party- perpetrator theory.', 'At trial, the state called Pawtucket police Detective Richard LaForest (Det. LaForest). Prior to Det. LaForest‟s testimony, however, defense counsel alerted the trial justice that she planned to inquire about the interview Det. LaForest had with Jones, who was not a trial witness. Specifically, she intended to ask Det. LaForest whether, during his videotaped statement to Pawtucket police, Jones had stated that Nieves had swung a knife at Jones or defendant. Defense counsel explained that the statement was not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted—namely, that Nieves had swung a knife—but instead was being offered to show that Arias‟s testimony was the product of improper influence.', 'The trial justice ruled that the proposed area of inquiry was off-limits, deeming Jones‟s statement to the police “rank hearsay.”', 'The defendant presented two witnesses: defense investigator Steven Joseph Daigle (Daigle) and Delon. Daigle testified that, shortly before defendant‟s trial, he and defense counsel 5', 'During trial, Nieves‟s statement to the police came before the jury through three witnesses: Ptlm. Jesse, Pawtucket police Patrolman Justin Gould, who heard Nieves make this statement to Ptlm. Jesse, and Nieves.', '-5- went to Prospect Heights and spoke with Arias. Daigle further testified that the conversation was conducted in English, that he had no problem understanding what Arias said, and that Arias did not appear to be having any problem understanding Daigle‟s questions. According to Daigle, when asked whether defendant was the shooter, Arias responded: “You don‟t understand. I have three children, and I have to live here.” Daigle stated that, when he and defense counsel asked Arias why she identified defendant as the shooter in the photo lineup, she stated that she “was told to.” Daigle further testified that, when asked who had told her to identify defendant as the shooter, Arias replied: “I have to live here. I have three children.” According to Daigle, when he and defense counsel asked Arias whether Jones or Jones‟s mother told her to select defendant from the photo lineup, she terminated the interview, stating that she would prefer to have a Spanish interpreter present before she answered any further questions. Arias, who testified with the assistance of an interpreter at defendant‟s trial, unequivocally denied telling defense counsel or Daigle that anyone told her to select defendant from the photo lineup.', 'The defendant also attempted to elicit from Daigle testimony about his brief encounter with Jones‟s mother. At sidebar, defense counsel made an offer of proof that, when Daigle and defense counsel spoke to Jones‟s mother about the case and told her that they had spoken with a witness in the housing complex, she became very angry and began shouting at them. Defense counsel theorized that an inference could be drawn by the jury that, because Jones‟s mother knew that Arias had discussed the case with defense counsel, Arias denied that anyone attempted to influence her testimony. The state countered that this evidence was speculative and irrelevant. The trial justice agreed and did not permit this line of inquiry.', 'During Delon‟s direct examination, he described the circumstances surrounding the street fight among several women earlier in the evening; he testified that Jones‟s niece told him and his', '-6- companions about the fight at its inception and that he, Jones, and defendant went outside.6 The trial justice permitted Delon to testify that, although Jones was never involved in a physical altercation, he was arguing with some of the people who were outside and that “he was kind of mad.” Defense counsel asked Delon why he thought that Jones was “kind of mad[,]” to which he responded, “I don‟t know.” When asked to describe what Jones looked like during this argument, Delon testified, “He looked like hisself [sic].” Delon further testified that he did not see anyone confront Jones with a weapon.', 'Defense counsel also attempted to elicit testimony concerning what Jones, defendant, and Delon did after the street fight had ended. When asked to describe how Jones was acting after the argument, Delon testified, over the state‟s objection, “Well, he was trying to forget about it, but he was--[.]” Before he could finish that answer, however, the trial justice declared: “We‟re not going to do that. That answer‟s stricken.” At sidebar, defense counsel argued that, despite the trial justice‟s pretrial ruling that she could elicit testimony concerning Jones‟s demeanor after the altercation in the street, the trial justice had “completely prevented” her from doing so. The trial justice explained that he would not permit Delon to testify that Jones was trying to forget about the encounter; he further observed that defendant‟s proffer during his pretrial motion did not concern what transpired after the street fight when the trio returned to Jones‟s mother‟s house. However, Delon was permitted to answer defense counsel‟s question, “What was [Jones] 6', 'Delon testified that “it seemed like everybody was against us as soon as we walked out [of] the house[,]” and the trial justice sustained the state‟s objection. The trial justice permitted defense counsel to ask, over the state‟s objection, “What were the [thirty] or so people [who were outside watching or participating in the fight] doing?” After Delon testified, “I seen [sic] they was [sic] like they was [sic] trying to fight us[,]” a sidebar conference ensued, in which the trial justice explained to defense counsel: “If you want to focus on Jerry Jones and ask [Delon] what was Jones‟s reaction and what did he see Jones do, that‟s one thing. I don‟t want to hear about some kind of a gang fight out there.”', '-7- doing [after the police broke up the street fight]?” He stated that, after the fight was over, “[the group] was * * * sitting on the couch taking turns on the [video] game.”', 'The jury ultimately convicted defendant on all of the remaining counts in the information (counts 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 14). The defendant moved for a new trial, asserting two grounds. First, he argued that the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence because Nieves testified that his assailant was the man who was arguing with him and his friends, and Arias testified that Jones was that man; the implication of this testimony, according to defendant, was clear: Jones, and not defendant, was the shooter.', 'Second, defendant contended that the trial justice‟s limitation of Det. LaForest‟s cross-examination constituted an error of law necessitating a new trial.', 'The trial justice denied the new-trial motion. He explained that defendant had neglected to mention that both Arias and Nieves testified that the shooter was defendant, not Jones. Although he acknowledged that Arias and Nieves “arrived [at trial] with some baggage,” the trial justice was “satisfied that their testimony was, as the jury obviously concluded, trustworthy and credible. And, therefore, the verdicts of the jury convicting * * * defendant of the several counts were well[ ]warranted.”', 'The total sentence imposed on the various counts of conviction amounted to an aggregate of sixty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with fifty years to serve.7', 'The defendant appeals, positing three grounds for vacating the judgment. The defendant first contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying his motion in limine to 7', 'The trial justice sentenced defendant to twenty years on counts 2 and 6, to be served concurrently; twenty years without parole on count 4, to be served consecutive to count 2; ten years on count 7, to run consecutive to counts 2 and 4; ten years suspended, with probation, on count 8, to be served consecutive to counts 2, 4, and 7 and to be served without parole if defendant ever violates that probation; and ten years suspended, with probation, on count 14, to run concurrently with count 8 but consecutive to counts 2, 4, and 7.', '-8- exclude Nieves‟s statement, “Tell my father that I love him.” The defendant next asserts that the trial justice improperly precluded him from presenting his third-party-perpetrator defense. Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice clearly erred in denying his motion for a new trial.', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]t „is well settled that we review a trial justice‟s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.‟” State v.

Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009)).

First, defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying his motion in limine to exclude Nieves‟s statement.', 'Additionally, defendant contends that several evidentiary rulings of the trial justice effectively precluded defendant from presenting his third- party-perpetrator defense.', 'Rule 403 provides:', '“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative', 'value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,', '- 10 -', 'confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by', 'considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless', 'presentation of cumulative evidence.” It is well settled that “[t]he application of Rule 403 is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Smith, 39 A.3d at 674 (quoting State v. Rios, 996 A.2d 635, 640 (R.I. 2010)). However, “a trial justice‟s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly. * * * It is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” Id. at 675 (quoting State v.

We reject these contentions.', 'Initially, we are satisfied that Nieves‟s statement surmounted the relevancy threshold for admissibility. Count 4 of the criminal information charged defendant with discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in injury to Nieves in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(2). Subsection (b)(2) of § 11-47-3.2 provides for a punishment of twenty years “if a person other than a police officer is injured by the discharge of the firearm” during the 8', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides the following definition of relevant evidence: “„Relevant evidence‟ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.”', '- 11 - commission of a crime of violence. See § 11-47-3.2(a) (“No person shall use a firearm while committing or attempting to commit a crime of violence.”); § 11-47-3.2(b)(2) (“Every person who, while committing an offense violating subsection (a) of this section, discharges a firearm shall be guilty of a felony and be imprisoned as follows: * * * (2) Twenty (20) years, if a person other than a police officer is injured by the discharge of the firearm * * *[.]”). Evidence that, when confronted with questions from the responding officer, all that Nieves could muster was, “Tell my father that I love him[,]” tends to establish that Nieves was “injured by the discharge of the firearm[,]” as § 11-47-3.2(b)(2) contemplates. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the statement was relevant.9', 'With respect to defendant‟s Rule 403 argument, we agree with the trial justice that the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As the trial justice recognized, this statement in no way implicated defendant as the party responsible for Nieves‟s injuries. Moreover, although we agree with defendant that this statement may have had an emotional impact on the jurors, we note, as did the trial justice, that Nieves was testifying from a wheelchair, where he will spend the remainder of his life. Any emotional impact that Nieves‟s statement may have had pales in comparison to the impact of observing a wheelchair-bound victim—with a bullet still lodged in his spine—testify about the 9', 'The fact that defendant may not have disputed the existence or extent of Nieves‟s injuries is of no consequence to our relevancy analysis.

In light of our deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting this statement.', 'B', 'Third-Party-Perpetrator Evidence', 'The defendant next contends that the trial justice committed evidentiary and constitutional error by precluding him from fully pursuing his third-party-perpetrator defense. There are two components to this argument.', 'First, defendant argues that the trial justice impermissibly precluded him from eliciting evidence of Jones‟s purported motive to shoot Nieves during defendant‟s direct examination of Delon. Second, defendant claims that the trial justice improperly excluded evidence that tended to show that Arias‟s testimony had been influenced by Jones or Jones‟s mother. The defendant maintains that these evidentiary rulings by the trial justice, in addition to being erroneous, deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense.', 'It is well settled that “[d]ue process requires that every defendant have a full opportunity to establish the best and fullest defense available to him.” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 621 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Patriarca, 112 R.I. 14, 37-38, 308 A.2d 300, 315 (1973)); see also State v. Wright, 817 A.2d 600, 609 (R.I. 2003). Similarly free from doubt is the “self-evident proposition that „an appropriate defense to a charge of criminal misconduct is that another person was the true perpetrator of the crime.‟” State v.

Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005) (“There is no question that a defendant is entitled to present a defense that implicates another person.”). This defense, however, is not without limits.', 'Third-party-perpetrator evidence is not per se admissible; unguarded use of “evidence of a third person‟s potential motive or opportunity to commit the crime [could] lead to jury speculation [or] improperly open up collateral matters.” Wright, 817 A.2d at 610; see also State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1275 (R.I. 2009); State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 825 (R.I. 1980). A criminal defendant is required to make a “reasonably specific” offer of proof with respect to such evidence. Barros, 24 A.3d at 1184; see also Rivera v. State, 58 A.3d 171, 181 n.7 (R.I. 2013); Scanlon, 982 A.2d at 1275; Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111. The defense must be grounded on articulable facts, not fanciful speculation. The offer of proof must contain “[(1)] evidence of another person‟s motive to commit the crime with which a defendant is charged * * * in conjunction with other evidence tending to show [(2)] the third person‟s opportunity to commit the crime and [(3)] a proximate connection between that person and the actual commission of the crime.” Rivera, 58 A.3d at 181 n.7 (quoting Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111); see also Barros, 24 A.3d at 1184; Gazerro, 420 A.2d at 825. Moreover, defense counsel must have “a good-faith basis for asking a witness about a given set of facts at trial because there is a danger that the jury may consider questions that are not factually based and then deliberate on matters that are not in evidence.” Peoples, 996 A.2d at 665.', 'We address defendant‟s argument mindful that he was accorded leeway in pursuing this defense theory, notwithstanding the paucity of proof he produced at trial.', 'In his proffer, defendant informed the trial justice that Delon would testify that Jones had been involved in the earlier altercation in the street; that Jones‟s niece was an active participant in that fight; and that', '- 14 - Jones was very upset after that fight took place. Although the trial justice properly was skeptical that defendant‟s offer of proof was adequate to support this defense, defendant nevertheless was permitted to show that Jones was angry earlier in the evening of September 29, 2010. To that end, Delon was permitted to tell the jury how Jones learned of the street fight; that Jones was not involved in a physical altercation; that he was arguing with some unidentified spectators; and that Jones “was kind of mad.” Additionally, the trial justice permitted defense counsel to ask whether Jones had been confronted with any type of weapon while the group was in the street— he was not.', 'Although the trial justice remarked that defendant‟s offer of proof did not encompass what transpired after the street fight, he permitted Delon to describe their activities after he, Jones, and defendant returned to Jones‟s mother‟s home: They played video games. The trial justice also permitted Delon, over the state‟s objection, to “describe the way Jerry was acting after” the group returned from the fight; it was only when Delon answered, “Well, he was trying to forget about it, but he was--” that the trial justice intervened and struck the answer. (Emphasis added.) Finally, the trial justice allowed Daigle to testify, over the state‟s objection, that Arias told him that she selected defendant as the shooter because she “was told to[,]” and defense counsel cross-examined Arias on this statement. Therefore, we reject the assertion that defendant was “completely prevented” from pursuing this defense. We address his assignments of error in turn.', '1', 'Delon’s Testimony', 'The defendant argues that he was improperly prevented from eliciting testimony from Delon that the people involved in the street fight were “against” Jones and that the trial justice', '- 15 - erroneously prevented defendant from asking Delon how Jones was acting after the fight. We disagree.', 'With respect to Delon‟s testimony that the participants or onlookers of the street fight were “against” Jones, the trial justice refused to allow Delon to testify that there was some sort of gang fight in the street when, clearly, this was not accurate. Delon was permitted to testify that Jones was arguing with some of the people in the street and that “he was kind of mad.” Delon also described how Jones looked during this argument. Thus, as defendant successfully elicited evidence of a verbal altercation involving Jones and Jones‟s reaction to that confrontation, we are hard-pressed to understand how Delon‟s impression that thirty people on the street were “against” Jones furthers defendant‟s third-party-perpetrator defense. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in limiting the scope of Delon‟s testimony in this manner.', 'The defendant next argues that he was improperly prevented from asking Delon how Jones was acting after the commotion had subsided. In response to defense counsel‟s question, “How would you describe the way Jerry was acting after that?”, Delon testified, “Well he was trying to forget about it, but he was--[.]” In explaining his decision to strike that answer, the trial justice stated: “I‟m certainly not going to permit him, if he was talking about Jerry Jones, to say that he was just trying to forget about it but couldn‟t, or something like that. I‟m not going to let him speculate as to what Jones was thinking, [or] trying to do, from his subjective point of view.”', 'The trial justice correctly recognized that a witness may not give an opinion as to the inner thoughts or feelings of another person or testify that another person was trying to forget something. See State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 423 (R.I. 1993) (“There is no rational basis upon', '- 16 - which a witness can determine that another person looks as though he has been threatened or is in court against his will. * * * [I]t can scarcely be contended that in the ordinary course of events a lay witness is able to determine such inner feelings as might arise if a person was threatened. This is a question that a lay witness (and probably most expert witnesses) would be totally unqualified to answer.”); see also State v. Tep, 56 A.3d 942, 947 (R.I. 2012) (finding no error in the admission of a witness‟s testimony that the defendant “aimed” a gun at the witness and others and that the defendant “focused on—at, in my mind, hitting one of us” because the testimony “merely described what [the witness] perceived, not what he believed [the defendant] thought or intended”). The trial justice simply struck the improper response that Jones was trying to forget about the fight. Significantly, defense counsel neither rephrased the question nor endeavored to elicit admissible evidence about Jones‟s conduct after the fight.', 'We discern no abuse of discretion in striking this answer.', '2', 'Evidence of Influenced Testimony', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erroneously excluded evidence that tended to show that Arias‟s testimony had been influenced by Jones or Jones‟s mother. Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in (1) prohibiting defendant from cross-examining Det. LaForest about Jones‟s out-of-court statement to the police and (2) denying defendant the opportunity to elicit testimony about Jones‟s mother‟s reaction to Daigle. We reject these contentions.', 'The defendant argues that Jones‟s statement to the police was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted in the statement—that Nieves had a knife and swung it at Jones—but to show the similarity between Jones‟s statement and Arias‟s in-court testimony concerning', '- 17 - Nieves‟s use of a knife; defendant contends that, because Arias had never before stated that Nieves swung a knife at Jones, her testimony was influenced.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in excluding this evidence because defendant‟s intended use of Jones‟s statement would invite the jury to seize on the mere fact that both Jones and Arias stated that Nieves swung a knife and then reach the conclusion that Jones had influenced Arias‟s testimony. This is a classic example of the type of impermissible speculation that our precedent in third-party-perpetrator cases condemns. See Wright, 817 A.2d at 610 (“[E]vidence of a third person‟s potential motive or opportunity to commit the crime must not lead to jury speculation nor improperly open up collateral matters.”); see also Scanlon, 982 A.2d at 1275 (explaining the danger that “this evidence could constitute „an impermissible invitation to the jury to speculate on a collateral matter‟” quoting Gomes, 881 A.2d at 112); cf. State v.

Finally, defense counsel hammered home for the jury during closing argument that Arias had testified for the first time at trial that Nieves swung a knife at Jones, and she argued forcefully that this belated detail was the result of someone having influenced the witness. Thus, we are satisfied that, to the extent any error was committed below, it had no effect on the jury‟s guilty verdict.', 'We similarly are not persuaded by defendant‟s argument that the trial justice erroneously precluded Daigle from testifying about his interaction with Jones‟s mother. The defendant contends that Daigle would have testified that, when his conversation with Jones‟s mother turned to the shooting investigation, her demeanor instantly soured and she began yelling at defense counsel and Daigle. We are in full agreement with the prosecutor that this evidence invites “pure speculation”; there is not a scintilla of evidence in this case of any contact between Jones‟s mother and Arias, and the capstone of defendant‟s pyramid of inferences—that Jones‟s mother influenced Arias‟s testimony—rests upon conjecture and surmise. We are confident that the trial justice acted well within his discretion in excluding this highly speculative evidence.

As we have', '- 19 - already determined that the trial justice committed no error in foreclosing this line of inquiry during cross-examination of Det.

In this regard, defendant points out that Nieves testified that defendant was arguing with Ortega, while Arias testified that Jones was the one arguing with Ortega. The defendant also notes that Arias testified that Jones stormed back towards the group just before the shots were fired, while Nieves testified that, at the time of the shooting, the shooter was “in the middle walking around” and “arguing with everybody[.]” According to defendant, “[t]he testimony of the two eye witnesses is clearly irreconcilable and reasonable doubt is abundant in this case.” We are not persuaded.', 'Initially, we note that the testimony of Arias and Nieves was in agreement on one critical fact: Both identified the defendant as the shooter. While the trial justice recognized that Nieves and Arias “arrived with some baggage,” he found that this baggage “was fully exposed to the jury.” The trial justice elaborated: “Nieves had ingested several beers during the evening, and Arias was confronted with some prior inconsistent statements.', 'Yet, in the end, the jury obviously found these two witnesses credible and reliable. I cannot fault their decision to do so.” He found the testimony of these witnesses to be “trustworthy and credible.” We are convinced that the trial justice ably complied with the new-trial-motion procedure, articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, and did not overlook or misconceive material evidence or otherwise clearly err.', 'We accordingly cannot fault his denial of the defendant‟s new-trial motion.', '- 20 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment.

2,Karen Lombardi : v. : City of Providence et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 6, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The state appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of its codefendant, the City of Providence (city). The state argues that the trial justice erroneously determined that the city had no duty to maintain the sidewalk where the plaintiff, Karen Lombardi, fell and was injured. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of counsel, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In January 2007, plaintiff tripped over a portion of a sidewalk adjacent to 180 South Main Street, Providence, Rhode Island. After serving notice upon the Providence City Council in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 45-15-5,1 plaintiff filed suit against the city, alleging that it 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-15-5 provides:', '-1- negligently failed to maintain or repair the portion of the sidewalk where she fell and that she had suffered serious injuries as a result. The plaintiff later amended her complaint to add the state as a defendant. The state answered plaintiff‟s complaint but, significantly, did not assert a cross-claim for contribution or indemnification against the city in accordance with Rule 13(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.2', 'The city moved for summary judgment, arguing that it did not owe a duty to plaintiff because the state, and not the city, was responsible for the maintenance and repair of the sidewalk. Citing G.L. 1956 §§ 24-8-6 and 24-8-9, the city contended that the state may assume full legal responsibility for designated roadways within a municipality. 3 The city argued that the', '“Every person who has any money due him or her from any town or city, or any', 'claim or demand against any town or city, for any matter, cause, or thing', 'whatsoever, shall take the following method to obtain what is due: The person', 'shall present to the town council of the town, or to the city council of the city, a', 'particular account of that person‟s claim, debt, damages, or demand, and how', 'incurred or contracted; which being done, in case just and due satisfaction is not', 'made to him or her by the town or city treasurer of the town or city within forty', '(40) days after the presentment of the claim, debt, damages, or demand, the', 'person may commence his or her action against the treasurer for the recovery of', 'the complaint.” 2', 'Rule 13(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides:', '“A pleading may state as a cross-claim any claim by one party against a co-party', 'arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either of the', 'original action or of a counterclaim therein or relating to any property that is the', 'subject matter of the original action. Such cross-claim may include a claim that', 'the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for', 'all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.” 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 24-8-6 provides:', '“The director of transportation shall have the power and authority to make,', 'lay in and upon, and construct sidewalks, including curbs, adjacent to and along', 'either or any one side or both sides of any state road, now constructed, in the', 'process of construction, or to be constructed, which in his or her opinion and', 'judgment require sidewalks and curbs for pedestrian travel.”', '-2- state had done just that with respect to the sidewalks on South Main Street by virtue of P.L. 1985, ch. 364, §§ 1-2.4 Section 24-8-9 provides:', '“The director of transportation shall have the power and authority to alter,', 'to maintain, to keep in good condition, to remove ice and snow therefrom, to', 'remove posts, steps and any other obstructions therein, to regulate the placement,', 'structure, and alteration of curbs constructed adjacent to state roads, to regulate', 'the height, size, and shape of awnings, signs, and any other structures which', 'project over all curbs and all sidewalks now constructed, in the process of', 'construction or to be constructed on state roads; except, on portion or portions of', 'state roads in cities or towns where the territory contiguous thereto is closely built', 'up.” 4', 'Public Laws 1985, ch. 364, §§ 1-2 provided, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“SECTION 1.

The state pointed to the following facts that, the state contended, indicated that the city had exercised control over the sidewalks on South Main Street: an alleged agreement between the city and the state that allocated responsibility for maintenance of the sidewalks to the city; repairs to the sidewalks and street made by the city; the fact that the city “routinely maintains South Main Street”; and, finally, the fact that the city posted parking meters and collected parking fees and fines along the street.', 'The state argued that it had delegated its responsibility under P.L. 1985, ch. 364, §§ 1-2 to the city by virtue of the agreement.', 'In response, the city relied upon a rescript decision by a justice of the Superior Court that involved facts similar to this case to support its position that no genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to which entity had a duty to maintain the sidewalk. In that earlier case, the plaintiff tripped on the sidewalk at 180 South Main Street and sued the city and the state; the city successfully obtained summary judgment because the trial justice determined that it had no duty to maintain the sidewalk. The city argued that a similar result was required in this case.', 'After the trial justice granted summary judgment, the state moved for reconsideration of that decision. The state reiterated its position that the city had exercised control over the South Main Street sidewalks and supplemented that argument with the assertion that the city has maintained vegetation along the sidewalks that has necessitated root repair and the consequent upheaval of pieces of the sidewalk. The state again argued that this evidence created a genuine issue of material fact as to the identity of the entity that was responsible for sidewalk repair. In', 'In 2011, the General Assembly repealed P.L. 1985, ch. 364 in its entirety. P.L. 2011, ch. 395, § 1; P.L. 2011, ch. 333, § 1. This circumstance has no bearing on this case, however, as P.L. 1985, ch. 364, §§ 1-2 was in full effect at the time of plaintiff‟s fall.', '-4- its opposition to reconsideration, the city argued that the state‟s evidence did not establish any disputed facts because there was no connection between the city‟s actions with respect to South Main Street and the defect that caused plaintiff‟s fall. Additionally, the city contended that, under § 45-15-11, a municipality does not assume liability for injuries sustained on a highway or street simply by making repairs to the highway or street.5', 'The trial justice denied the state‟s motion for reconsideration of the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city. The plaintiff moved for relief from the judgment based on newly discovered work orders that indicated that the city had made repairs to the concrete in the sidewalk at 180 South Main Street. The state filed a notice of appeal and, the next day, filed its own motion for relief from judgment based on the same two work orders that were cited in plaintiff‟s motion. The trial justice denied these motions. Final judgment on plaintiff‟s claim was entered in favor of the city.6', 'After oral argument before this Court, we ordered the parties to file supplemental memoranda on the issue of whether the state, having chosen not to file a cross-claim against the city, was a “party aggrieved by” the final judgment under G.L. 1956 § 9-24-1 and this Court‟s decisions in Adams v. United Developers, Inc., 121 R.I. 177, 179-80, 397 A.2d 503, 505 (1979), and Markham v. Cross Transportation, Inc., 119 R.I. 213, 229, 376 A.2d 1359, 1367-68 (1977). 5', 'Section 45-15-11 provides:', '“No work done by any city or town, upon any way or street, in mending or', 'repairing the way or street, shall constitute or be any evidence of an acceptance of', 'the way or street by the city or town, nor shall it in any way change the status of', 'the way or street; and the mending or repairing of the way or street shall in no', 'way render the city or town liable to pay compensation or damages by reason of', 'injuries suffered by any person or persons traveling upon the way or street.” 6', 'Although the caption of this case bears her name, plaintiff is not a party to this appeal, and, through counsel, she has represented to this Court that she “takes no position as to issues between the parties” on appeal.', '-5-', 'Analysis', '“Unless an individual is qualified as an appellant, his [or her] purported appeal will be considered void.” Adams, 121 R.I. at 179, 397 A.2d at 505. In this case, the right to appeal from a final judgment of the Superior Court is set forth in § 9-24-1, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ny party aggrieved by a final judgment, decree, or order of the [S]uperior [C]ourt may, within the time prescribed by applicable procedural rules, appeal to the [S]upreme [C]ourt.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Section 9-24-1 “must be read in light of our long-established rule that a person is aggrieved by a judgment when it adversely affects, in a substantial manner, his [or her] personal or property rights.” Adams, 121 R.I. at 179, 397 A.2d at 505; see also Bowles v. Dannin, 62 R.I. 36, 42, 2 A.2d 892, 895 (1938) (“An aggrieved party [under a predecessor statute of § 9-24-1 with nearly identical language] has been held by this [C]ourt to be one who „is aggrieved by the judgment or decree when it operates on his [or her] rights of property, or bears directly upon his [or her] interest. * * * The word “aggrieved” refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right or the imposition upon a party of a burden or obligation.‟” quoting Tillinghast v. Brown University, 24 R.I. 179, 183-84, 52 A. 891, 892 (1902)). “Moreover, an aggrieved party is one whose interest in the lower court decision is actual and practical, as opposed to merely theoretical.” Adams, 121 R.I. at 180, 397 A.2d at 505 (emphasis added); see also Bowles, 62 R.I. at 42, 2 A.2d at 895.', 'In this case, because it chose not to file a cross-claim against the city, the state is not an aggrieved party under this standard. The trial justice entered summary judgment in favor of the city on plaintiff‟s claim—the only claim asserted against the city. The plaintiff, unquestionably a “party aggrieved by” entry of summary judgment in favor of the city, has not appealed from this', '-6- judgment; indeed, she has represented to this Court that she takes no position on the merits of the state‟s appeal. The state is not permitted to prosecute an appeal in plaintiff‟s stead when she has declined to do so. Because the state has not asserted any cross-claim against its codefendant, it is not sufficiently aggrieved by the entry of summary judgment in favor of the city on plaintiff‟s claim.', 'This conclusion is compelled by our decision in Markham. In Markham, 119 R.I. at 217- 19, 228, 376 A.2d at 1362, 1367, the jury returned a split verdict, finding several defendants not liable (codefendants) and several other defendants liable to the plaintiffs; two of the defendants who were found liable (appellants) moved for a new trial with respect to the verdict in favor of the codefendants. The trial justice denied the motion, concluding that, because the appellants had not filed any cross-claims against the codefendants, they lacked standing to move for a new trial with respect to the codefendants. Id. at 228, 376 A.2d at 1367. The appellants appealed, arguing that, “because of their substantial interest in having other codefendants to contribute to the burden of the judgment, they fit the definition of aggrieved parties” under § 9-24-1. Markham, 119 R.I. at 219, 228-29, 376 A.2d at 1362, 1367.', 'We disagreed, declaring that “it is well-established law that „a defendant who is himself liable is not aggrieved by the exoneration of a codefendant.‟” Markham, 119 R.I. at 229, 376 A.2d at 1367 (quoting Swails v. General Electric Co., 70 Cal. Rptr. 143, 146 (Cal. Ct. App. 1968)). We held that “the better view is to deny standing to appeal to any codefendant who does not assert * * * a cross-claim [against an exculpated codefendant] in the pleadings.” Id. at 230, 376 A.2d at 1368. We elaborated:', '“The court in Donofrio also went on to say that an appeal was', 'possible if a cross-claim was made against a codefendant, but', 'without such cross-claim, there was no standing to pursue an', 'appeal. The court suggested that it would be inequitable to allow a', '-7-', 'contrary result because „an appellant who never believed that he', '[or she] had any rights against his [or her] exonerated co-', 'defendant, and who never asserted any claim against him [or her],', '[could then] appeal upon alleged errors favorable to the exculpated', 'defendant.‟” Id. at 229-30, 376 A.2d at 1368 (quoting Donofrio v.', 'Farr Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 149 A.2d 611, 615 (N.J. Super. Ct.', 'App. Div. 1959)).', 'In Markham, this Court recognized the potential right of contribution of the appellants, which was the basis of their claim for a new trial:', '“It is indeed true that the right to contribution may be lost, but this', 'statutory right is inchoate until such time as another is adjudicated', 'or admits being a joint tortfeasor and the one seeking contribution', 'has paid more than his [or her] pro rata share. The rules permit a', 'defendant to assert such a claim as a cross-claim for contribution in', 'the original action, and in that way protect his [or her] right to', 'appeal. Super. R. Civ. P. 13(g). However, if no cross-claim is', 'filed, then no right of action exists between codefendants; and', 'therefore, one found liable is not an aggrieved party for purposes', 'of appeal within the meaning of § 9-24-1 as to the judgment in', 'favor of the other.” Markham, 119 R.I. at 230, 376 A.2d at 1368.', 'In this case, as in Markham, a defendant who has not asserted a cross-claim against its now-exculpated codefendant is attempting to appeal from the judgment entered on the plaintiff‟s claims in favor of the codefendant. Because the state has not filed a cross-claim against the city, “no right of action exists between [these] codefendants.” Markham, 119 R.I. at 230, 376 A.2d at 1368. Therefore, the state “is not an aggrieved party for purposes of appeal within the meaning of § 9-24-1 as to the judgment in favor of the [city].” Markham, 119 R.I. at 230, 376 A.2d at 1368.', 'The state attempts to blunt the force of this reasoning by arguing that “[t]he holding in Markham has been limited to standing to move for a new trial.” To support this contention, the state cites this Court‟s decisions in Cooney v. Molis, 640 A.2d 527, 529 (R.I. 1994), and', '-8- LaBounty v. LaBounty, 497 A.2d 302, 306 (R.I. 1985). We disagree that our holding in Markham has been limited to the context of a motion for a new trial.', 'In LaBounty, 497 A.2d at 303-04, the jury found the appellant, LaBounty, 25 percent liable to the plaintiff and found another defendant—who had settled with the plaintiff for $10,000 in exchange for a joint-tortfeasor release, in which the plaintiff released LaBounty “from any and all actions, causes of action, claims and demands for, upon or by reason of the pro rata share caused by or attributable to the [settling defendant]”—to be 75 percent at fault for the plaintiff‟s injuries. The trial justice entered judgment in the plaintiff‟s favor against LaBounty in the amount of $62,500, which represented 25 percent of the plaintiff‟s total damages of $250,000. Id. at 304. However, the trial justice later modified the judgment to the sum of $240,000, representing the plaintiff‟s damages that remained after the settling defendant‟s payment of $10,000 was subtracted from the total. Id.', 'Before this Court on appeal from the modified judgment, the plaintiff argued that, because LaBounty had not filed a cross-claim against the settling defendant, this Court‟s decision in Markham doomed LaBounty‟s appeal. LaBounty, 497 A.2d at 306. We disagreed, declaring that “[t]he absence of a cross-claim in this case is immaterial since [LaBounty] is not attempting to assert any claim against [the settling defendant] but only to obtain the benefit of the release secured by [the settling defendant] for [LaBounty‟s] own benefit.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, LaBounty involved a situation where the appellant was appealing from a judgment increasing the sum of money he owed to the plaintiff—a judgment by which the appellant unquestionably was aggrieved—and not a situation, like that involved in this case and in Markham, where one defendant appeals from a judgment that a codefendant is not liable to the plaintiff. LaBounty did not confine Markham to the context of standing to move for a new trial.', '-9-', 'Similarly, this Court‟s decision in Cooney did not limit our holding in Markham. In Cooney, 640 A.2d at 528, we confronted the question of “whether settling joint tortfeasors who are not liable to any other parties in a suit must be retained in the suit to determine the nonsettling tortfeasor‟s proportionate liability”; we held that they need not be retained. In an effort to forestall this holding, the nonsettling tortfeasor, Molis, argued that the settling tortfeasors needed to “remain as parties to preserve Molis‟s right to appeal the jury apportionment of liability” because, under Markham, “his failure to maintain a cross-claim against the [settling tortfeasors] would preclude his appeal of the jury‟s apportionment of liability.” Cooney, 640 A.2d at 529. We rejected this contention, explaining that Markham “in no way precludes a defendant‟s otherwise proper appeal of a jury‟s apportionment of liability when there was a settling joint tortfeasor.” Id.', 'Cooney simply recognizes that a defendant who is found liable to a plaintiff is “a party aggrieved by” the judgment entered against the defendant in favor of the plaintiff, § 9-24-1; that decision does not purport to limit Markham to the new-trial-motion context or to preclude its application in a situation where, as here, one defendant appeals from the entry of judgment in favor of a codefendant on the plaintiff‟s claim when the appellant-defendant has chosen not to assert a cross-claim against the codefendant.', 'The state also seeks to distinguish Markham by noting that the judgment exonerating a codefendant in this case, unlike in Markham, was entered after limited discovery; the state notes that the work orders showing the city‟s repairs to the sidewalk at 180 South Main Street were not uncovered until after summary judgment was entered.', 'Additionally, the state argues that', '- 10 - premature assertion of a cross-claim would run afoul of Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.7 We are unconvinced.', 'For one thing, the filing of a cross-claim need not await the discovery of irrefutable evidence that a claim for contribution or indemnification exists or an ultimate finding of liability by the jury or trial justice; the text of Rule 13(g) clearly permits a cross-claim to assert “that the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.” (Emphasis added.) For another thing, prior to the entry of summary judgment in this case, the state argued to the trial justice that the city owed a duty to maintain the area of the sidewalk where plaintiff fell; to support this contention, the state relied on: the agreement between the city and the state that allocated some responsibility for maintenance of the sidewalks to the city; the city‟s previous repairs to the sidewalks and street; and the city‟s maintenance of posted parking meters and collection of parking fees and fines along the street.', 'Had the state filed a cross-claim against the city 7', 'Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a party represented by an', 'attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney‟s', 'individual name, whose address and telephone number shall be stated. * * * The', 'signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the', 'signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer‟s', 'knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well', 'grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the', 'extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed', 'for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or', 'needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is', 'not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is', 'called to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a pleading, motion, or other', 'paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own', 'initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both,', 'any appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or', 'parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the', 'pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney‟s fee.”', '- 11 - asserting, pursuant to Rule 13(g), “that the [city] * * * may be liable to the [state] for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the [state],” this evidence easily would have complied with the mandate of Rule 11 that the cross-claim be “well grounded in fact and * * * warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and * * * not [be] interposed for any improper purpose.”', 'The state insists that it is sufficiently aggrieved by the final judgment in favor of the city on plaintiff‟s claim because the judgment effectively holds the state responsible for maintenance of the sidewalks on South Main Street and affords the city immunity from liability for its negligent repairs. We disagree. The entry of summary judgment for the city accomplished only a determination that the city owed no duty to plaintiff in this case; the trial justice did not, as the state suggests, purport to delineate, for all time, the respective maintenance obligations of the city and state with respect to South Main Street.8', 'Finally, both the state and the city urge us to overlook the state‟s lack of standing and to reach the merits of the state‟s appeal. The city asserts that “the question of the [c]ity‟s and the [s]tate‟s respective responsibilities for various public roads has been at the heart of numerous lawsuits[,]” and both the city and the state agree that immediate resolution of the issues raised in 8', 'We express no opinion on whether the state may seek to implead the city, which is now no longer a party to this action by virtue of the entry of final judgment on the only claim currently asserted against it, under Rule 14(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Similarly, we express no opinion on whether the state may initiate a separate action for contribution or indemnification against the city in the event the state should be found liable to plaintiff. In either scenario, the state may be eligible for appellate review—this time as a sufficiently aggrieved party—from an adverse judgment entered against it. The fact that the state may have alternative avenues for securing our review of the issues it presents in this appeal convinces us that the impact of this judgment on the state presently is speculative, and not actual and practical as our cases require. See Adams v. United Developers, Inc., 121 R.I. 177, 181, 397 A.2d 503, 506 (1979) (“The judgment in the court below has such a speculative effect on the rights of [the appellant] that we believe it lacks the requisite interest to qualify as an appellant.”).', '- 12 - the state‟s appeal would serve the public interest. Additionally, both parties stress that, in the interests of judicial economy, this Court should address the merits of the state‟s appeal.', 'Although we have the authority to look past an appellant‟s dubious standing and tackle the merits of an appeal, see, e.g., Ricard v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 113 R.I. 528, 530-31, 535-36, 324 A.2d 671, 672-73, 675 (1974), we decline to do so in this case for several reasons. The fact that the issues raised in the state‟s appeal are also “at the heart of numerous lawsuits” actually undermines the plea for immediate review. The pendency of these “numerous lawsuits” increases the chances that the issues raised in the state‟s appeal will be brought before this Court by a sufficiently aggrieved appellant after the allegedly injured party has had his or her day in court. We reiterate that, had the state asserted a cross-claim against the city and summary judgment entered in favor of the city on that cross-claim, we would not be confronted with a problem of standing. Additionally, if plaintiff had prosecuted this appeal, we would not hesitate to address her appellate contentions. See Pullen v. State, 707 A.2d 686, 687- 92 (R.I. 1998) (addressing the merits of the plaintiff‟s appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the City of Newport on the plaintiff‟s claim against it on the ground that the state, and not the City of Newport, was responsible for the sidewalk where the plaintiff was injured).', 'Also, even if a decision on the merits of the state‟s appeal would serve the interests of judicial economy as well as the public interest, we cannot ignore the countervailing interest in deciding only those cases in which the party pursuing the appeal has standing. This Court “will not entertain an abstract question or render an advisory opinion, * * * with the exception for constitutionally mandated advisory opinions found in article 10, section 3, of the Rhode Island Constitution.” H.V. Collins Co. v. Williams, 990 A.2d 845, 847 (R.I. 2010); see also Rhode', '- 13 - Island Republican Party v. Daluz, 961 A.2d 287, 295 (R.I. 2008). The request that we overlook the state‟s lack of standing and issue a decision on the merits effectively is a request for an advisory opinion in a situation not encompassed by article 10, section 3 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'In sum, we will not address the issues raised in the state‟s appeal until those issues are presented to us by a sufficiently aggrieved party under § 9-24-1. The state presently is not such a party in this case. Accordingly, we express no opinion on these issues at this time.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

3,: v. : Joann LaFlam. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to a question certified by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in accordance with Article I, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. The question centers on the combined effect of two components of a contractual limitations period contained in the uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM) provision of an insurance contract issued by the plaintiff, American States Insurance Company (ASIC); one component specifies that legal action against ASIC under the policy must be brought within a three-year interval and the other provides that the three-year period begins to run on the date of the accident. The Court of Appeals certified the following question to this Court:', '“In light of the UM/UIM statute[, G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2.1,] and', 'Rhode Island public policy, would Rhode Island enforce the two', 'provisions of the contractual limitations clause in this case?” For the reasons that follow, we answer the certified question in the negative.1 1', 'We gratefully acknowledge the amicus curiae briefs submitted by the New England Legal Foundation, the Rhode Island Association for Justice, and the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (DBR).', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The back story of this case is straightforward and undisputed. On April 25, 2007, defendant, Joann LaFlam (LaFlam),2 was involved in an automobile collision while operating a vehicle insured under a policy issued by ASIC to her employer.', 'LaFlam alleges that she sustained serious injuries as a result of the collision. Almost one year later, on April 3, 2008, LaFlam sent ASIC written notice of a potential claim under ASIC‟s UM/UIM coverage. On April 23, 2008, ASIC acknowledged receipt of this notice and requested information on LaFlam‟s claim. Thereafter, ASIC contacted LaFlam four times between September 2008 and late May 2009 for additional information and updates regarding her medical condition.', 'The insurance contract between ASIC and its insured, LaFlam‟s employer, provided that a settlement with the UM/UIM tortfeasor required prior authorization from ASIC.3 To that end, on January 25, 2010, LaFlam requested authorization from ASIC to settle her underlying tort claims against the two UIM tortfeasors. ASIC approved the request on February 18, 2010, and, on May 19, 2010, LaFlam sent ASIC a demand for $1 million, the policy limit, to settle her UIM claim.', 'ASIC did not formally deny the claim, but, instead, responded with this declaratory- judgment action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, on August 25, 2010. ASIC asserted that, because LaFlam had failed to undertake legal action 2', 'The record is unclear as to the spelling of LaFlam‟s first name. In her pleadings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island and in the District Court‟s opinion, “Joann” is used. See American States Insurance Co. v. LaFlam, 808 F. Supp. 2d 400, 400, 401 (D.R.I. 2011). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and her attorney before this Court refer to LaFlam as “JoAnn.” See American States Insurance Co. v. LaFlam, 672 F.3d 38, 38, 39 (1st Cir. 2012). 3', 'LaFlam was an insured under the insurance policy because she was “occupying” a covered “auto” at the time of the collision.', '-2- against ASIC or submit a written demand for arbitration within the three-year limitations period contained in the policy, her UIM claim against ASIC was time-barred. The relevant clause of the policy provides as follows:', '“Any legal action against us under this Coverage Form must be', 'brought within three years after the date of the „accident‟.', 'However, this [p]aragraph * * * does not apply to an „insured‟ if,', 'within three years after the date of the „accident‟, we or the', '„insured‟ have made a written demand for arbitration in accordance', 'with the provisions of this Coverage Form.” On the heels of LaFlam‟s answer and her assertion of numerous counterclaims,4 the parties filed competing motions for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; the dispositive issue at the heart of these motions was whether the three-year limitations period set forth in the policy was enforceable or was in violation of public policy. Additionally, LaFlam moved to certify two questions to this Court.5', 'The District Court denied LaFlam‟s motion for certification and entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of ASIC. The trial judge first determined that, because “[t]he limitations period in the [p]olicy operates not to restrict coverage, but to fix the time within which an insured may bring legal action against the insurer[,]” the clause did not violate public policy. American States Insurance Co. v. LaFlam, 808 F. Supp. 2d 400, 404 (D.R.I. 2011). He noted 4', 'Although LaFlam alleged in her counterclaim for declaratory judgment that ASIC‟s authorized representative told her that “arbitration should not be requested as the file was being reviewed and an offer would be made[,]” she failed to press this allegation any further in the District Court. The District Court deemed it abandoned, LaFlam, 808 F. Supp. 2d at 402 n.3, and so shall we. 5', 'LaFlam moved to have the following two questions certified to this Court:', '“1) Is a contractual three year statute of limitations provided within the uninsured', 'motorist portion of an insurance policy void as against public policy[?], and 2)', 'Does the statute of limitations provided within an uninsured motorist [insurance', 'policy] begin to run prior to the time it is clear that the insured will not recover all', 'sums from the tortfeasor(s)[?]”', '-3- that “the Rhode Island Supreme Court has had the opportunity to declare contractual limitations provisions in UM policies void as against public policy, but has declined to do so” and that, “although the Rhode Island General Assembly has expressly restricted contractual limitations provisions in other contexts, it has included no such restriction in the UM statute.” Id. Although the District Court‟s analysis focused primarily on whether an insurer validly may shorten the limitations period from ten years to three years, the trial judge additionally determined that our decision in Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 924-25 (R.I. 2006), provided “[s]ufficient authority * * * to conclude that the limitations period for a UM claim, whether by statute or contractual provision, begins to run at the date of the accident.” LaFlam, 808 F. Supp. 2d at 402 n.4.', 'On appeal to the Court of Appeals, LaFlam once again urged that two questions be certified to this Court.6', 'The Court of Appeals concluded that “Rhode Island has clearly expressed a strong public policy against insurers using contractual language to limit an insured‟s recovery under the UM/UIM statute.” American States Insurance Co. v. LaFlam, 672 F.3d 38, 39 (1st Cir. 2012). However, the Court of Appeals “found „no controlling precedent‟ in Rhode Island law” to assist it in determining “whether considerations of public policy bar insurers from (1) imposing a contractual limitations period on UM/UIM claims which is shorter than the ten- year statute of limitations provided by statute, or (2) requiring that the limitations period begin to 6', 'LaFlam requested that the Court of Appeals certify the following two questions to this Court:', '“I.', 'Is a provision in the UM/UIM portion of an insurance policy issued in', 'Rhode Island which reduces the time a UIM claim may be brought from the', 'statutory 10 years to 3 years void as against public policy?', '“II. Is a provision in the UM/UIM portion of an insurance policy issued in', 'Rhode Island which provides that the UIM coverage claims period begins to', 'run on the date of the „accident‟ void as against public policy?”', '-4- run on the date of the accident.” Id. Significantly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the “two aspects of the ASIC clause at issue * * * are interrelated. A short contractual limitations period that begins to run on the date of the accident may operate to bar an insured from recovery before the insured even knows she has a UM/UIM claim.” Id. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals certified the question quoted above to this Court. Id. at 44. We now proceed to answer the certified question.', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 6(a) permits this Court to answer questions of law certified to it by federal courts:', '“This Court may answer questions of law certified to it by the', 'Supreme Court of the United States, a Court of Appeals of the', 'United States, or of the District of Columbia, or a United States', 'District Court when requested by the certifying court if there are', 'involved in any proceeding before it questions of law of this state', 'which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the', 'certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court', 'there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this Court.” Certified questions that properly are before us “are questions of law * * * reviewed de novo by this Court.” In re Tetreault, 11 A.3d 635, 639 (R.I. 2011).', 'Analysis', 'I', 'In order to place the certified question into its proper context, we deem it necessary to survey the landscape of UM/UIM coverage in Rhode Island. The General Assembly enacted the UM/UIM statute, § 27-7-2.1, in 1962. P.L. 1962, ch. 161, § 1. Section 27-7-2.1 “requires insurance carriers to provide protection for those claimants who voluntarily contract with licensed carriers for liability coverage as against uninsured operators.” Henderson v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 35 A.3d 902, 906 (R.I. 2012) (quoting DiTata v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 542 A.2d 245, 247 (R.I. 1988)). “This statute was premised on the concept that responsible', '-5- motorists who carry liability insurance should not be uncompensated when they are without recourse against an uninsured tortfeasor.” Id. (quoting Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Streicker, 583 A.2d 550, 553 (R.I. 1990)).', 'We repeatedly have explained that “[t]he purpose of enacting the uninsured-motorist coverage statute was to afford protection to the insured against „economic loss resulting from injuries sustained by reason of the negligent operation of uninsured motor vehicles or hit-and-run motor vehicles.‟” Henderson, 35 A.3d at 906 (quoting McVicker v. Travelers Insurance Co., 785 A.2d 550, 553-54 (R.I. 2001)); see also Rueschemeyer v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 673 A.2d 448, 450 (R.I. 1996); Pin Pin H. Su v. Kemper Insurance Companies/American Motorists Insurance Co., 431 A.2d 416, 419 (R.I. 1981) (recognizing this “broad statutory purpose” behind § 27-7-2.1); Aldcroft v. Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York, 106 R.I. 311, 318, 259 A.2d 408, 413 (1969).', 'Moreover, “[c]ontracts for uninsured-motorist coverage * * * must be construed in light of the public policy mandated by the Legislature.” Henderson, 35 A.3d at 906 (quoting DiTata, 542 A.2d at 247).', '“The primary object remains indemnification for an insured‟s loss rather than defeat of his or her claim.” DiTata, 542 A.2d at 247.', 'Public policy in this area, however, is not entirely one-sided. We also are mindful that “[t]he legislative purpose of the statute was not * * * „to guard against all economic loss,‟ and we have held that reasonable limitations will be imposed on the construction of the uninsured- motorist statute to „afford[ ] insurers some financial protection‟ from unwarranted claims.” Henderson, 35 A.3d at 906 (quoting Ladouceur v. Hanover Insurance Co., 682 A.2d 467, 470 (R.I. 1996)); see also Streicker, 583 A.2d at 553 (“We must impose reasonable limitations on the extent that the uninsured-motorist statute is construed to protect an insured because public policy', '-6- also dictates that we construe the statute „in a manner that affords insurers some financial protection.‟” quoting DiTata, 542 A.2d at 248).', 'Several times since the enactment of § 27-7-2.1, this Court has been called upon to determine whether a particular provision of a UM/UIM policy violates the public policy of this state. Although the determination of whether a particular contractual provision violates public policy is case-specific, see Henderson, 35 A.3d at 908 n.11, 909 (declaring that “the terms of an insurance policy must be considered with reference to the specific matter before us” and finding the provision enforceable “[w]hen applied to the circumstances of this case,” but noting that “[i]f the exclusion were applied to [other] circumstances * * *, its application may well be questionable in light of public policy”), our cases reveal some general guidelines.', 'On the one hand, UM/UIM policy provisions “that restrict coverage afforded by the uninsured-motorist statute are void as a matter of public policy.” Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Viti, 850 A.2d 104, 107 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Rueschemeyer, 673 A.2d at 450). Additionally, “this [C]ourt has disallowed contractual limitations that curtail an insured‟s recovery in instances in which the insured has not recovered the amount of his or her actual loss.” DiTata, 542 A.2d at 248. For example, we held in Rueschemeyer, 673 A.2d at 451, that a provision in a UM/UIM policy that excluded government-owned vehicles from the definition of “uninsured motor vehicle” “impermissibly restrict[ed] coverage afforded by the statute.” See also Sentry Insurance Co. v. Castillo, 574 A.2d 138, 138, 140 (R.I. 1990) (“provision restricting coverage for accidents involving snowmobiles” held void as against public policy); Employers‟ Fire Insurance Co. v. Baker, 119 R.I. 734, 742-43, 383 A.2d 1005, 1009 (1978) (“excess-escape” clause held void as against public policy); Poulos v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 119 R.I. 409, 412, 379 A.2d 362, 364 (1977) (deduction for workers‟ compensation benefits received by', '-7- insured held void as against public policy); Pickering v. American Employers Insurance Co., 109 R.I. 143, 153, 282 A.2d 584, 590 (1971) (“excess-escape” clause held void as against public policy); Aldcroft, 106 R.I. at 319-20, 259 A.2d at 414 (deduction for workers‟ compensation benefits received by insured held void as against public policy). Likewise, where a provision purports to deny UM/UIM coverage on impermissible grounds, this Court has not hesitated to declare the provision in violation of public policy. See Pin Pin H. Su, 431 A.2d at 417, 419 (concluding that a provision “requir[ing] physical contact between the insured person or vehicle and the unidentified vehicle in order to establish coverage for injuries” violated public policy because the Court deemed it “wholly inappropriate to allow an insurance company to deny coverage on the sole ground of lack of physical contact when the claimant is able to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that his or her injuries resulted from the negligence of an unidentified motorist”).', 'On the other hand, this Court has declared on several occasions that certain reasonable limitations on UM/UIM coverage did not violate the state‟s public policy that indemnification for an insured‟s loss is the primary purpose of the UM/UIM statute. For example, policy provisions that seek to prevent an insured‟s double recovery have been upheld. See Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Graziano, 587 A.2d 916, 917, 919 (R.I. 1991) (upholding a provision that set off any recovery of UM/UIM benefits by the amount the claimant had already received under the liability section of the same policy because “[c]lear and unambiguous set-off provisions are valid attempts by the insurance companies to avoid claims for double recovery, which could result in prohibitive costs for insurance carriers as well as for those paying premiums, and as such are not contrary to public policy”); Streicker, 583 A.2d at 553 (upholding policy exclusion intended “to prevent an individual from recovering under both the liability and', '-8- the [UM/UIM] provisions of the policy”); DiTata, 542 A.2d at 248 (recognizing that a provision deducting from UM/UIM benefits any medical payments paid under the policy “is an important, legitimate limitation for the insurer * * * [that] works in conjunction with [UM] coverage to prevent double payment of medical expenses by the insurer”).', 'Additionally, this Court consistently has upheld policy provisions that exclude UM/UIM coverage when the insured‟s injuries occur in a vehicle that the insured (or a family member) owns, but elects not to insure under the policy. See Viti, 850 A.2d at 107; Dellagrotta v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 639 A.2d 980, 980-81 (R.I. 1994); Baker, 119 R.I. at 741, 383 A.2d at 1008-09; see also Malo v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 459 A.2d 954, 956-57 (R.I. 1983) (a restriction of UM coverage to the insured and the insured‟s family members, but only those who did not own their own vehicles, did not violate public policy). Geographical-limitation provisions “applicable to both the liability portions of the policy and the uninsured-motorist provisions of the policy” also have been upheld. Pollard v. Hartford Insurance Co., 583 A.2d 79, 81 (R.I. 1990). Finally, this Court has recognized that provisions that reasonably “preclude[ ] coverage based on a particular use of an insured vehicle by the policyholder” may, in certain circumstances, not violate public policy. Henderson, 35 A.3d at 908; see id. at 908, 909 (holding that “for a fee” vehicle-use exclusion did not violate public policy “[w]hen applied to the circumstances of [that] case,” but recognizing that different facts might compel a different conclusion); see also Murray v. Remuck, 108 R.I. 179, 182, 185, 273 A.2d 491, 493, 494 (1971) (upholding exclusion of UM coverage in circumstances when insured was employed or engaged in duties in connection with an automobile business).7 7', 'ASIC contends that Henderson v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 35 A.3d 902, 908 (R.I. 2012), stands for the proposition that provisions in UM/UIM contracts will be invalidated “on public policy grounds only when they (1) „narrow[ ] the definition of “uninsured motor vehicle”‟ or (2)', '-9-', 'Notably, however, we have not had occasion to pass upon the enforceability of a contractual limitations period in a UM/UIM policy that sets the time in which legal action against the UM/UIM carrier must be initiated by the insured, by filing suit or demanding arbitration. Relying on our decision in Progressive Northern Insurance Co. v. Lyden, 986 A.2d 231, 235 (R.I. 2010), ASIC appears to dispute this observation. However, we deem this reliance misplaced for two reasons. First and foremost, the contractual limitations period in Lyden was fundamentally different in kind from the provision at issue in this case. In Lyden, 986 A.2d at 232, unlike in this case, the insured was not precluded from adjudicating his UIM claim, but merely challenged the arbitration award outside of the time period; the provision at issue provided that “[t]he decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon the parties unless: * * * either party reserves his or her right to a jury trial * * * within sixty (60) days of the decision.” In this case, by contrast, the contractual limitations period sets the time in which legal action against the UM/UIM carrier must be initiated by the insured in order to secure an adjudication— either by arbitration or civil action—in the first instance. Moreover, the insured‟s argument in Lyden was not that the limitations period should be declared void as against public policy, but that “the trial justice abused his discretion * * * when he rejected [the insured‟s] argument that he should be afforded relief from his failure to timely reject the award because of his attorneys‟ excusable neglect.” Id. at 233. Thus, Lyden is inapposite to the certified question before us.', 'Finally, with respect to the limitations period on UM/UIM claims, we note that § 27-7- 2.1 is silent both as to when a UM/UIM claim begins to accrue and as to the length of the „reduce[ ] the amount of coverage to a quantity less than the statutory minimum.‟” (Emphasis added.) To the contrary, in Henderson, 35 A.3d at 908, we merely stated that the provision under review in that case, unlike the provisions in three other cases, neither narrowed the definition of uninsured motor vehicle nor reduced the amount of coverage; we did not suggest that these two classes of provisions were the only limitations subject to invalidation on public-policy grounds.', '- 10 - limitations period. This Court held in Pickering, 109 R.I. at 150, 282 A.2d at 588, that, because “the insured‟s suit against his insurer over a policy contract * * * is fundamentally one in contract[,]” the statute of limitations applicable to contract actions governs UM/UIM claims. See G.L. 1956 § 9-1-13(a) (“Except as otherwise specially provided, all civil actions shall be commenced within ten (10) years next after the cause of action shall accrue, and not after.”). We have not yet had occasion to address the question of when a cause of action against the carrier for UM/UIM coverage accrues.', 'II', 'With this context in mind, we turn to the certified question. It is our task to determine whether the clause in the ASIC policy that requires a UM/UIM claimant to initiate “legal action” or make “a written demand for arbitration” “within three years after the date of the „accident‟” is unenforceable as against public policy.8 Before the District Court and the Court of Appeals, LaFlam sought certification of two questions, each addressing a single component of the clause at issue. See nn. 5, 6, supra. The Court of Appeals consolidated these two questions into a single inquiry: “In light of the UM/UIM statute and Rhode Island public policy, would Rhode Island enforce the two provisions of the contractual limitations clause in this case?” We agree with our learned colleagues on the Court of Appeals that the proper analytical approach is to scrutinize the combined effect of the two components of this clause, rather than analyze each component in isolation. 8', 'The policy defines the term “accident” as follows: “„[a]ccident‟ includes continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in „bodily injury‟ or „property damage[.]‟” We will assume, without deciding, that the “accident” in this case, for purposes of triggering the commencement of the contractual limitations period, was the automobile collision that occurred on April 25, 2007.', '- 11 -', 'The opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case succinctly explains the potential danger of a contractual limitations period that both (a) begins to run on the date of the accident and (b) is shorter than the statutory limitations period: “a shorter contractual limitations period may have the unique effect, present in the UM/UIM context but not in other insurance contexts, of barring recovery before the insured knows or has reason to know that she has a UM/UIM claim against her insurer.” LaFlam, 672 F.3d at 43. As the Court of Appeals recognized, in some cases, “it [may] not become clear that the insured has such a claim until after the insured has attempted to obtain compensation from the tortfeasor. The insured * * * may well not know whether the tortfeasor is underinsured in light of the damages until long after the accident.” Id. Thus, the clause under review in this case “may effectively bar recovery” because the three-year limitations period, which begins to run on the date of the accident, would impractically “require some insureds to file suit before it becomes clear that the tortfeasor is underinsured at all, particularly if the insured remains mired in legal battle with the tortfeasor and has not yet achieved a judgment.” Id. at 43-44.', 'A', 'Although the just-outlined specter is the product of the tandem effect of the shortened limitations period and the selection of the date of the accident as the triggering date, we deem most troubling the selection of the triggering date. By requiring the three-year contractual limitations period to run from the date of the accident, the policy in this case essentially provides that an insured‟s UM/UIM claim accrues, for purposes of the contract of insurance, on the date of the accident. ASIC maintains that this circumstance is perfectly consistent with our decision in Barry, which, ASIC contends, held that the statute of limitations on a UM/UIM cause of action begins to run on the date of the accident. We reject this reading of Barry, which addressed', '- 12 - “the appropriate calculation formula for prejudgment interest in [the] uninsured/underinsured motorist [context].” Barry, 892 A.2d at 916.', 'In Barry, 892 A.2d at 923, we confronted, inter alia, the issue of whether a claim for UM/UIM “benefits over and above any amount received from the tortfeasor or the tortfeasor‟s insurer include[s] the amount of prejudgment interest (beginning on the date of the injury) that accrued on the underlying claim for damages against the tortfeasor(s) through the date of any settlement with the tortfeasor(s)[.]” We concluded that a UM/UIM claim includes prejudgment interest that accrued on the underlying claim because “the contractual duties of the UM[/UIM] carrier are set forth in the insurance policy and begin at the date of the injury.” Id. We noted that the insurance policy at issue required the UM/UIM carrier to “pay damages for bodily injuries * * * that the insured is „legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an uninsured highway vehicle‟” and that, “[i]n this state, an injured plaintiff who recovers damages in any civil action, is legally entitled to collect, both pecuniary damages, and „[prejudgment interest] * * * from the date the cause of action accrued[.]‟” Id. at 923-24 (quoting G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10(a)).', 'We determined that “an insured „is legally entitled to collect‟ prejudgment interest from the date the [underlying tort] cause of action accrues, which we [held was] the date of the injury.” Id. at 924. Our opinion in Barry did not purport to decide the very different issue of when a cause of action against one‟s insurance carrier for UM/UIM compensation accrues. See LaFlam, 672 F.3d at 44 (“[I]t is far from clear that [Barry], concerned with the different issue of the accrual date for prejudgment interest, resolves this case.”).', 'Therefore, the issue of when a UM/UIM cause of action accrues is one of first impression in this jurisdiction. “„[T]he overwhelming majority of * * * jurisdictions [that have considered this issue] have concluded that the limitations period begins to run on a UIM claim upon the', '- 13 - insurer‟s breach of the insurance contract‟ rather than the date of the accident.” LaFlam, 672 F.3d at 43 (quoting Grayson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, 971 P.2d 798, 799 (Nev. 1998)).9 After careful consideration, we are persuaded to join this majority. 9', 'See, e.g., McDonnell v.

A UM/UIM carrier has not only a fiduciary duty to its insured,10 but it also possesses the means to prevent the belated assertion of overly stale claims. Moreover, we are hard-pressed to envision a scenario in which an insured who is in need of benefits and who has a viable UM/UIM claim, occurring only because the tortfeasor‟s policy limits were less than the insured is “legally entitled to recover because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting from that injury, sickness or disease,” § 27-7-2.1(g), would delay asserting the claim and remain less than fully compensated any longer than necessary.', 'Finally, at oral argument, ASIC appeared to take a somewhat different tack. Relying on subsections (g) and (h) of § 27-7-2.1,11 ASIC argued that a UM/UIM cause of action accrues 10', 'We take this opportunity to reiterate that “an insurance company has a fiduciary obligation to act in the „best interests of its insured,‟ and not its own pecuniary interest at all times.” Skaling v.

An „underinsured motorist‟ is the owner or operator of a', 'motor vehicle who carries automobile liability insurance with coverage in an', 'amount less than the limits or damages that persons insured pursuant to this', 'section are legally entitled to recover because of bodily injury, sickness, or', 'disease, including death, resulting from that injury, sickness or disease.” Section 27-7-2.1(h) provides as follows:', '- 17 - when the insured receives information about the respective limits of the tortfeasor‟s insurance policy and the particulars of the insured‟s UM/UIM policy. According to ASIC, once the insured determines that the limits of his or her UM/UIM policy exceed those of the tortfeasor‟s policy, the insured has a claim for UM/UIM benefits. ASIC maintains that it is at this point that an insured can notify his or her UM/UIM carrier of the existence of the claim and file suit or proceed to arbitration. ASIC argues that the fact that the amount of the damages may be unknown until the insured settles with or obtains a judgment against the tortfeasor is of no consequence; the insured simply can request a stay of the proceedings against the UM/UIM carrier until the extent of the insured‟s claim and his or her damages is ascertained. We reject this argument.', 'For one thing, the point in time when the insured learns that the limits of the applicable UM/UIM policy are greater than those of the tortfeasor‟s policy may never come to pass. If an insured with UM/UIM policy limits of $100,000 is injured by a tortfeasor with a policy limit of $250,000, the insured‟s UM/UIM policy limits do not exceed the tortfeasor‟s policy limits. If it is later determined that the insured suffered $300,000 in damages as a result of the tortfeasor‟s negligence, however, the insured would nonetheless have a claim for UIM benefits against his or her insurer. See § 27-7-2.1(g) (“An „underinsured motorist‟ is the owner or operator of a motor vehicle who carries automobile liability insurance with coverage in an amount less than the', '“A person entitled to recover damages pursuant to this section shall not be', 'required to make a claim against or bring an action against the uninsured or', 'underinsured tortfeasor as a prerequisite to recover damages from the insurer', 'providing coverage pursuant to this section.

Federal Insurance Co., 690 A.2d 1348, 1350 (R.I. 1997) (“Because § 27-7-2.1(g) is phrased in the disjunctive, the underinsured motorist‟s liability coverage need only be less than either the insured‟s limits or the damages she is entitled to recover.”); id. (“[E]ven in those situations in which the insured‟s damages exceed the underinsured motorist‟s coverage but the insured‟s underinsured-motorist limits are less than the underinsured motorist‟s liability-insurance coverage, the insured is still entitled to recover from his or her own insurer under § 27-7-2.1(g).”). Therefore, the accrual date for a UM/UIM cause of action cannot be the date advocated by ASIC at oral argument because that date simply would be inapplicable for an entire subset of UIM cases.', 'Furthermore, the notion that a UM/UIM claimant would submit his or her claim to arbitration or resort to expensive litigation before becoming aware of the extent of his or her damages strikes us as problematical. ASIC conceded at oral argument that a UM/UIM claimant who submits his or her claim to arbitration would be at the mercy of the arbitrator with respect to whether the arbitration proceedings would be stayed in order to conduct discovery to ascertain the extent of the claimant‟s damages. But parties do not submit a dispute to arbitration in order to obtain a stay for discovery purposes; they submit to arbitration in order to obtain a decision from the arbitrators.', 'The Minnesota Supreme Court‟s decision in Oanes v. Allstate Insurance Co., 617 N.W.2d 401, 405-06 (Minn. 2000), illustrates the problem inherent in ASIC‟s position. Under the then-prevailing Minnesota law, the statute of limitations on a UIM claim began to run on the date of the accident, but a UIM claim was “not [considered] ripe until the underlying tort claim', '- 19 - [was] resolved, either by settlement or judgment.” Id. at 405.12 The court recognized that these two legal propositions at times were at odds: “This interplay between the two rules creates the possibility that the statute of limitations may run on a valid UIM claim before the claimant can determine whether the claim exists. That result is inconsistent with our sense of justice and one we cannot abide.”', 'Id. at 405.', 'The court noted that “[i]t ha[d] been suggested that this undesirable result can be avoided” if a potential UIM claimant commences suit within the applicable statutory period from the date of the accident “and then request[s] that the trial be stayed until the tort action was either settled or litigated to completion.” Id. (quoting Cattnach v. State Farm Insurance Co., 577 N.W.2d 251, 254 (Minn. Ct. App. 1998)). The court was not persuaded:', '“Although this solution provides a vehicle for both rules to remain', 'viable, it does so at a cost. That cost is the invitation to bring', 'litigation, including the attendant burden and expense placed on', 'finite judicial resources as well as on the parties, for cases in which', 'no justiciable controversy currently exists or may ever exist. We', 'decline to extend such an invitation.” Id. at 405-06.', 'We similarly reject ASIC‟s suggestion of such a “hurry up and wait” approach to its contractual responsibilities, whereby potential UM/UIM claimants rush to file actions or make demands for arbitration only to request an immediate stay until the insured‟s underlying tort action can be resolved. Moreover, we fail to glean any viable purpose for such an absurd approach to UM/UIM coverage, save to allow the carrier to escape its obligations.13 12', 'The court overruled its prior rule that the statute of limitations on a UIM claim begins to run on the date of the accident and instead adopted as the accrual date the date on which the insured settles with or obtains a judgment against the tortfeasor. Oanes, 617 N.W.2d at 406-07 & n.2. 13', 'In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, ASIC asserts in its reply brief that this Court should conclude that the contractual limitations period in the ASIC policy is reasonable because the DBR approved this provision and this approval should be entitled to deference from this Court. We note that this argument, which is nowhere to be seen in ASIC‟s opening brief to this Court,', '- 20 -', 'Accordingly, for these reasons, we today join the overwhelming majority of our sister states and hold that a UM/UIM cause of action, which “is fundamentally [an action] in contract,” Pickering, 109 R.I. at 150, 282 A.2d at 588, accrues on the date that the UM/UIM contract allegedly is breached, which we reiterate is the date on which the UM/UIM insurer denies the claim or clearly rejects a demand for payment or arbitration under the UM/UIM policy.', 'B', 'Having determined that a UM/UIM cause of action accrues at the time the insurance contract is breached, we conclude that the contractual limitations period in this case is void as against public policy. The provision under review, which both shortens the period in which a UM/UIM claim may be asserted from the ten-year statute of limitations and fixes a date on which that shortened period begins to run that is earlier than the accrual date for the cause of action, is void and unenforceable as against the public policy that underlies § 27-7-2.1.', 'In reaching this conclusion, we find the Alaska Supreme Court‟s recent decision in McDonnell instructive. In McDonnell, 299 P.3d at 728, the court first held that the date of the alleged breach of the UM contract is the accrual date for a UM claim. The court was then tasked with determining whether the contractual limitations period in that case, which set the date of the accident as the accrual date, was enforceable. Id. at 732. The Alaska Supreme Court concluded that it was not: has been effectively rebutted by the DBR in its amicus brief; the DBR asserts that, because “[t]he [DBR] does not intend its review [of UM/UIM policy provisions] to be a comprehensive evaluation of the legal effect of the contractual provision” and “[t]he form review process has none of the indicia of the administrative processes under the [A]dministrative [P]rocedures [A]ct[,]” the DBR‟s review process is not to be accorded administrative deference. Moreover, we are of the opinion that the DBR‟s review process, even if entitled to some degree of deference, could never “make an unlawful policy lawful.” McDonnell, 299 P.3d at 732 (quoting Ennen v. Integon Indemnity Corp., 268 P.3d 277, 288 (Alaska 2012)).', '- 21 -', '“By shortening the accrual date for UM claims, State', 'Farm‟s contractual limitation provision attempts to shorten the', 'limitations period before an insured like McDonnell has a', 'justiciable cause of action against her insurer.', '“* * * [I]t is illogical and unreasonable to contractually', 'require commencement of the limitations period for a UM claim', 'before the insured has a justiciable cause of action against her', 'insurer. If the limitations period for a UM claim commenced on', 'the date of the accident, the insurer could potentially deny an', 'insured‟s claim or refuse payment shortly before the limitations', 'period ends, leaving the insured with insufficient time to file suit.', 'Similarly, the insurer could deny the insured‟s claim shortly after', 'the limitations period ends, thereby barring the insured from filing', 'suit at all. Given these practical considerations, we hold that to the', 'extent State Farm‟s contractual two-year limitation provision', 'purports to trigger the commencement of the limitations period', 'before an insured‟s cause of action against the insurance company', 'has accrued, the policy provision is unreasonable and', 'unenforceable.” Id. at 733.', 'We agree with these observations and conclude that the contractual limitations provision in this case is void as against public policy because, by selecting an earlier accrual date for UM/UIM claims, ASIC has attempted to force insureds like LaFlam to file suit or make a written demand for arbitration before a justiciable cause of action may even exist. This provision therefore impermissibly restricts UM/UIM coverage and frustrates the public policy concerns embodied in the state‟s UM/UIM statute.14 Because this provision cannot be reconciled with our 14', 'We reject ASIC‟s attempt to draw a distinction between contractual provisions that restrict UM/UIM coverage, on the one hand, and provisions, like the one involved in this case, that “act[ ] to fix the time in which a claim can be brought.” At least in the context of the contractual limitations provision in this case, this argument strikes us as relying on a distinction without a difference. Provisions that “act[ ] to fix the time in which a claim can be brought” can, in some circumstances, fix such an unreasonable time period as to amount to an effective restriction on coverage. The provision in this case, which both shortens the time frame in which a UM/UIM claim must be brought and selects a triggering date that is earlier than the accrual date for the UM/UIM cause of action, may have such an effect. See LaFlam, 672 F.3d at 43 (“[A] shorter contractual limitations period [that runs from the date of the accident, as opposed to the date of the insurer‟s alleged breach of the contract,] may have the unique effect, present in the UM/UIM', '- 22 - pronouncement that “[t]he primary object [of § 27-7-2.1] remains indemnification for an insured‟s loss rather than defeat of his or her claim[,]” it cannot stand. DiTata, 542 A.2d at 247.', 'We conclude by noting that our holding in this case is limited: we need not and do not decide whether an insurance policy may properly contain a shortened time period within which a UM/UIM claim may be brought after the cause of action accrues and, if so, whether a three-year time period, as was chosen in this case, would be reasonable.', 'We have explained that “reasonable limitations will be imposed on the construction of the uninsured-motorist statute to „afford[ ] insurers some financial protection‟ from unwarranted claims[,]” and we do not retreat from that pronouncement today. Henderson, 35 A.3d at 906 (quoting Ladouceur, 682 A.2d at 470). Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether an insurer may permissibly narrow the limitations period from the statutory ten-year period when the limitations period under the policy begins to run on the date of the insurer‟s alleged breach of the UM/UIM policy.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we answer the certified question in the negative.

The evidence established that plaintiffs used this right of way to access their tennis courts and that the gates to the tennis courts faced the right of way, separated by a two-foot-wide strip of plaintiffs‘ land running along the tennis courts. The claimed right of way was paved around 1999 or 2000 by the developers of the condominiums on defendants‘ premises. It was not until 2005 that the use of the right of way was disputed.', 'During the summer of 2005, a chain barrier was placed between two poles, positioned at the southern end of the claimed right of way, which impeded access by vehicle and foot traffic. The record discloses that, in the summer of 2006, the chain was replaced by one or more of the defendants with ―heavy plastic barriers which blocked vehicular traffic, and impeded pedestrian traffic.‖ Despite plaintiffs‘ protests that they had a right to use the right of way, defendants refused to remove the barriers.', 'In response, plaintiffs filed an action9 against defendants, alleging that, according to the condominium declaration, plaintiffs had an express easement over the right of way.', 'The Development Corporation, which created the Harrington Court Condominium.

The trial justice issued a written decision setting forth his factual findings and denying plaintiffs‘ easement claims.10 Specifically, the trial justice concluded that plaintiffs had failed to prove that the declaration and its amendments reserved an express easement over the claimed right of way. The trial justice determined ―that there is no amenity located in, by, along or adjacent to Narragansett Bay which [p]laintiffs are entitled to access.‖ He further found ―that the intent of the [d]eclarant * * * was to provide access to the proposed marina of Phase VI.‖11 Accordingly, he found that ―no right of way was created by § 14.2 of the First Declaration.‖', 'The trial justice next found that, ―[w]hen the [d]efendants‘ [p]remises [were] withdrawn, the Third Amendment did not grant to the [p]laintiffs or its members any right to use the proposed marina‖ and, ―[t]herefore, no right of way was necessary to access any such amenity[.]‖12 defendants to remove the barriers. The defendants counterclaimed for trespass—which claim the trial justice ultimately denied—but that issue is not before us on appeal. 10', 'The trial justice‘s decision is set forth in Wellington Condominium Association v. Wellington Cove Condominium Association, No. NC-2007-353, 2010 WL 3393143 (R.I. Super. Ct. Aug. 25, 2010). We need not repeat all of his findings; we reference only those principally pertinent to our discussion of the issues presented on appeal. In this decision, the trial justice also dissolved the June 17, 2009 preliminary injunction that was in place at the time of trial. 11', 'The issue of marina access—if any—is not before this Court. 12', 'The trial justice also addressed plaintiffs‘ remaining arguments regarding written instruments that they contend created an express easement. For example, he found that ―the Third Amendment, and all subsequent documents in [d]efendants‘ chain of title did not create a right of way for the benefit of the [p]laintiffs.‖ On appeal, however, plaintiffs challenge the trial justice‘s conclusions with respect to the operative language of section 14.2 of the declaration.', '-5-', 'As to plaintiffs‘ claim of an implied easement, the trial justice explained that, when a common owner severs his or her own land and retains the dominant estate, an implied easement over the servient estate can arise only if the easement is ―absolutely necessary‖ to the use and enjoyment of the dominant estate. In reaching this decision, however, the trial justice, noting that plaintiffs‘ premises constituted the dominant estate and the withdrawn parcel was the servient estate, concluded that the declarant, who withdrew the real estate, retained the dominant estate and failed to reserve an easement for itself. According to the trial justice, ―the [d]eclarant withdrew the [d]efendants‘ Premises (alleged servient estate)—i.e. severed it from the Full Property—in 1992 and did not reserve a right of way for the [p]laintiffs‘ Premises (alleged dominant estate) via the Third Amendment.‖ Therefore, the trial justice determined that the right of way was not absolutely necessary for plaintiffs‘ use of their properties because they were able to access Kirwins Fifth Ward Lane and their tennis courts through the access point on Harrington Street.13', 'Final judgment was entered on September 8, 2010, in favor of defendants. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on September 16, 2010.

Accordingly, the case now comes before us after full briefing and argument. 13', 'Specifically, the trial justice indicated that plaintiffs did not need the right of way to access the tennis courts because the alternative method of entry—a two-foot strip of the estate—was ―adequate to access the gates on the westerly side of [p]laintiffs‘ tennis courts.‖', '-6-', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred when he found that they had not proven the existence of an express easement. In particular, plaintiffs challenge the trial justice‘s reliance on language that does not appear in the declaration, and they contend that section 14.2 of the declaration entitles plaintiffs to an express easement over the right of way. Additionally, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice committed reversible error when he applied the wrong legal standard to plaintiffs‘ implied easement claim. The plaintiffs request that this Court remand the case for additional fact-finding on plaintiffs‘ claims for express easement and implied easement by grant.', 'Conversely, defendants argue that plaintiffs failed to establish that an express easement was set forth in the declaration of condominium. The defendants also argue that plaintiffs failed to establish an implied easement over the right of way. According to defendants, because plaintiffs retained the dominant estate after the withdrawal by Newport Partners, plaintiffs were required to demonstrate ―absolute necessity‖ to support their claim of an implied easement. The defendants further argue that, at the time of severance, the claimed right of way was neither apparent nor obvious, and that it was not permanent. Finally, defendants contend that plaintiffs failed to prove that the declarant intended to create a right of way across defendants‘ premises.', 'Standard of Review', '―It is well established that the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.‖ Hernandez v.

According to plaintiffs, the tennis courts qualify as such an amenity, and the', '-8- trial justice erred when he found that section 14.2 did not create an express easement over the withdrawn real estate. The plaintiffs base their appellate contentions on the trial justice‘s use of terms that are not explicitly found in section 14.2. Indeed, plaintiffs point out that the trial justice‘s analysis focused on whether any rights of way reasonably were necessary for access to amenities under section 14.2, but they then contend that he ―went astray‖ when he added language suggesting that the amenity must be a part of defendants‘ premises. The trial justice declared that ―[w]hen the [d]efendants‘ Premises was withdrawn, the [p]laintiffs had no right to use any amenity in, by, along or adjacent to Narragansett Bay located within the [d]efendants‘ Premises. Therefore, there was no need for a right of way to access any such amenity.‖ (Emphasis added.)

We agree with the trial justice that ―the intent of the [d]eclarant [in] including § 14.2 in the First Declaration was to provide access to the proposed marina‖; plainly, this is precisely the amenity to which section 14.2 refers. Even if the tennis courts could be considered an ―amenity‖ under section 14.2, this facility bears no relationship to Narragansett Bay. Indeed, the tennis courts are separated from the harbor by defendants‘ parcel. We are of the opinion that inclusion of ―Narragansett Bay‖ both limits and defines the type of ―amenity‖ to which the section referred. We read the section to mean that any such amenity must be directly connected to or linked with Narragansett Bay. A marina fits the bill; tennis courts do not. Therefore, we affirm the trial justice‘s decision with respect to plaintiffs‘ claim of an express easement.', 'We pause to note that the trial justice‘s inclusion of the phrase ―located within the [d]efendants‘ Premises‖—which does not appear in section 14.2 of the declaration—amounts to surplusage. The trial justice‘s decision was not premised on any finding concerning upon whose property the amenities must be located to qualify as an easement. Instead, the trial justice properly focused his analysis on the precise language of section 14.2 and the specific easement rights that were reserved—those relating to the marina. He stated that ―[t]he [c]ourt has found as a fact that there is no amenity located in, by, along or adjacent to Narragansett Bay which [p]laintiffs are entitled to access,‖ and that finding formed the basis of his conclusion. We discern no error in that conclusion.', '- 10 -', 'Implied Easement', 'We now turn to the more troubling issue in this case. When the trial justice discussed plaintiffs‘ implied easement claim, he began by noting that ―[t]he Rhode Island Supreme Court discussed the difference between an implied reservation of an easement and an implied grant of an easement in Wiesel v. Smira, 49 R.I. 246, 142 A. 148 (1928).‖ In that case, this Court explained that', '―the distinction is based upon the theory that the common owner‘s', 'deed of a portion of his land conveys all essential rights which he', 'has, and that whatever is apparent and continuously necessary to', 'the beneficial use and enjoyment of the granted property is', 'intended to be conveyed so far as the grantor could do so. * * *', 'From this it is clear that where the owner creates a severance by', 'sale of the servient portion of his premises[,] no implication of', 'intention to reserve any rights to himself as owner of the quasi', 'dominant estate ought to be made unless such rights are absolutely', 'necessary to the use of the property reserved.‖ Id. at 249, 142 A. at', '149 (emphasis added). Relying on this language, the trial justice reasoned that, ―when a common owner creates a severance of his own land and retains the dominant portion * * *, he is presumed to reserve whatever rights he needs in the servient portion of the real estate.‖ Thus, he found that ―an implied easement can only arise in such a situation if the rights in the servient estate are absolutely necessary to the dominant estate.‖14', 'However, when he applied these principles to the facts of this case, it is our opinion that he conflated the estates that were retained by the declarant and the portion that comprised plaintiffs‘ premises.', 'The trial justice concluded that, when ―the [d]eclarant withdrew the [d]efendants‘ Premises[,]‖ the declarant did not retain the servient estate. In effect, the trial 14', 'We note that, in Wiesel v. Smira, 49 R.I. 246, 253, 142 A. 148, 151 (1928), the easement involved underground property. See also Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1019 (R.I. 1999) (―The right to the flowage of water and the disposal of waste underneath the lands of another can be acquired * * * by implication from the severance of heritage ownership * * *.‖).', '- 11 - justice found that plaintiffs, the original condominium association, failed to reserve an easement for its premises when the parcel was severed. Having made this determination, the trial justice in his analysis then proceeded under the framework of an implied easement by reservation, which triggers the more exacting standard that the use of the easement must be ―absolutely necessary.‖ Wiesel, 49 R.I. at 249, 142 A. at 149. The trial justice declared that ―the [c]laimed [right of way] is not ‗absolutely necessary‘ for [plaintiffs]‖ and, proceeding from that premise, he held that ―[p]laintiffs have failed to prove the existence of an implied easement by reservation by clear and convincing evidence.‘‖ This Court, however, is not persuaded that this was the proper analysis because it rests on the erroneous conclusion that plaintiffs conveyed a portion of land without expressly reserving a right of way for their use. We are of the opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, the declarant withdrew and retained a portion of the premises—the servient estate—for its own commercial purposes, thereby in effect transferring the dominant estate to plaintiffs.', 'Our examination of the implied easement claim turns on a determination of which party, for purposes of easement principles, was the common owner of the property vested with the right to reserve an easement unto itself. As we confront that challenging question and the remaining issues that stem from it, we are mindful that certain basic tenets of property law do not coalesce easily with complex modern real estate transactions and the law of condominium development and ownership. Indeed, as this case illustrates, we are compelled to apply venerable common law principles of easements against a backdrop of contemporary statutory approaches to real estate ownership. The law of implied easements may not be well-suited to the facts of this complex case, but we nonetheless begin our discussion of the grantor/grantee dynamic and the type of implied easement that may or may not arise when the declarant severs the real estate', '- 12 - from the condominium and retains it for further development. Although the severance was characterized as a withdrawal of real estate, it constitutes a division of a parcel of land, resulting in separate parcels of real estate.15', 'According to the preamble of the declaration, the ―owner in fee simple‖ of the entire parcel was the declarant, an entity that is not a party to this action, to the extent that its corporate existence even continues. Under section 1.1 of the declaration, the declarant is defined as ―the owner in fee simple of the Real Estate.‖ The declarant reserved to itself the option to withdraw certain real estate from the parcel in accordance with section 14.2. When Newport Partners was assigned the same rights as the declarant, Newport Partners effectively stepped into the shoes of the declarant. Therefore, it was the declarant that withdrew the real estate and not plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were powerless to prevent this assignment to Newport Partners, and they equally were incapable of blocking the withdrawal of defendants‘ parcel or reserving anything to themselves. The plaintiffs conveyed nothing and cannot be deemed to be grantors or characterized as a common owner who conveys a portion of its estate. The plaintiffs simply claim that the disputed right of way was used and enjoyed during unity and for many years thereafter.', 'Because the common owner severed a portion of its estate and retained it for further development, a different analysis must be undertaken. Rather than framing the claim as an implied easement by reservation, it must be examined as an implied easement by grant in favor of WCA, the owner of the dominant parcel.', '―We have previously held that[,] ‗[u]pon the severance of an heritage, a grant will be implied of all those continuous and apparent easements which have in fact been used by the 15', 'Withdrawal and subdivision are close cousins; here, the withdrawal of Phases IV and VI was akin to a subdivision of land.

The state, even though specifically instructed to address that issue, does not argue that the denial without prejudice barred the second hearing. Instead, the state points (in a footnote) to the fact that the original motion was entitled ―Motion to Preserve Rule #35 Under Rhode Island Criminal Procedure,‖ and it asserts that defendant therefore may not have filed ―an actual Rule 35 motion‖ within the statutory time frame.', 'Black‘s Law Dictionary defines ―without prejudice‖ as meaning ―Without loss of any rights; in a way that does not harm or cancel the legal rights or privileges of a party.‖ Black‘s Law Dictionary 1740 (9th ed. 2009).

Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 505 (2001). The Court in Semtek proceeded to refer to the definition of ―dismissal without prejudice‖ in the then-current edition of Black‘s Law Dictionary as a ―dismissal that does not bar the plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit within the applicable limitations period.‖ Id. at 505–06 (quoting with approval Black‘s Law Dictionary 482 (7th ed. 1999)); see also Mirpuri v.

In our view, that October 19, 2009 denial without prejudice of defendant‘s motion to reduce sentence acted as a ruling on that motion—there was no further action that could have been taken on that motion after that point in time. Although, on December 10, 2010, defendant filed a ―Motion to Reduce Sentence/Assign Pursuant to Rule 35,‖ we consider that filing to be a new motion (notwithstanding the language contained within the text of that motion)—which filing was not made within 120 days after sentencing.5 Because the trial justice had disposed of the initial motion on October 19, 2009, nothing was pending before the court to assign for determination, other than the December 10, 2010 filing.

This case is before the Supreme Court on four consolidated appeals filed by the defendant, Patrick W. Meyer (Patrick or defendant).1 These appeals all stem from a divorce action that was commenced in April of 2009 when the plaintiff, Lori Noel Meyer (Lori or plaintiff), filed a complaint for divorce against the defendant. Patrick presses four issues on appeal: (1) whether or not the trial justice erred in denying Patrick‘s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which motion contended that Lori was not a resident of Rhode Island in accordance with the pertinent statute; (2) whether or not the trial justice erred in awarding Lori rehabilitative alimony; (3) whether or not the trial justice erred with respect to an award of counsel fees; and (4) whether or not the trial justice erred in his 1', 'In this opinion, we shall generally refer to Patrick W.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Family Court in their entirety.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Patrick and Lori were married on October 1, 2005 in Newport, Rhode Island. Although both had previously been married and children were born of those marriages, they had no children together. Some three-and-one-half years later, on April 22, 2009, Lori filed a complaint for divorce in Kent County Family Court. It is significant that Patrick was personally served in Rhode Island with a summons and the complaint on April 24, 2009. (We note that, after Patrick was served with a summons and the complaint for divorce, he never thereafter personally appeared in the Family Court for any of the several proceedings.) Patrick filed an answer, in which (inter alia) he neither admitted nor denied the allegation in the complaint that ―Lori Noel Meyer * * * has been a domiciled inhabitant of [Rhode Island] and has resided therein for more than one year next before filing of this Complaint and is now a domiciled inhabitant of [Rhode Island].‖', 'Early in the divorce proceedings, orders entered requiring Patrick to appear for the taking of his deposition. He was additionally ordered to pay Lori $20,000 as an advance of her equitable assignment. On September 9, 2009, Patrick filed a motion to dismiss Lori‘s complaint for divorce, averring that the Family Court did not have jurisdiction—because, he contended, Lori had not been ―a domiciled inhabitant and resident of the State of Rhode Island for one year prior to the filing‖ of the complaint.', '-2-', 'A', 'The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction', 'On February 15, 2010, the trial justice presided over a hearing on defendant‘s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. In the course of being questioned by Patrick‘s attorney, Lori testified: ―I reside at 500 East Greenwich Avenue, * * * West Warwick, Rhode Island.‖ She added that she had been residing at the same address when she filed her complaint for divorce on April 22, 2009. When asked by Patrick‘s attorney how long she had been ―physically living in the State of Rhode Island‖ prior to filing the complaint for divorce, Lori responded: ―I have always been physically living in the State of Rhode Island. I vacation in France.‖', 'Patrick‘s attorney then entered into evidence without objection various admissions made in Lori‘s August 25, 2009 Response to Defendant‘s Second Request for Admissions. In that document, Lori admitted that she ―had been physically present in France‖ from January 8 to August 8, 2008. Lori also admitted that, from September 3 to November 11, 2008, she had ―been physically present in‖ and ―had been living in France.‖ Additionally, Lori admitted that she returned to Rhode Island from France on November 12, 2008 and had been ―living in Rhode Island‖ since that date. In response to a question posed by Patrick‘s counsel during the hearing on February 15, 2010, Lori acknowledged that she had been out of this country for approximately 172 days between April of 2008 and April of 2009.', 'Lori additionally testified that she and Patrick owned a house in the South of France; their goal was to work on that house in order to have a ―very large vacation home‖ there. She added that they had stayed in several rented homes while they were working on that project. Lori explained that her role as an interior designer and project manager for their house in France', '-3- required her to be ―physically present while the project [was] under construction at all times.‖ She testified that, although she had stayed in France, her ―permanent residence has always been West Warwick, Rhode Island.‖ Lori further testified that her intent with respect to the home in the South of France was to ―vacation‖ there. She explained that she and Patrick did not ―have an intention to stay in France any particular amount of time.‖ She added: ―[We intended] to travel extensively and to spend our summers and our holidays here in Rhode Island at our home with our families.‖', 'In addition, Lori testified that she did not own the West Warwick home, but that her father did. She also testified that she had filed state and federal tax returns for tax years 2007 and 2008 and that she used the West Warwick address on those returns. Lori also testified that her voting address was in West Warwick and that she had not, in any documentation, state or federal, listed any other place as her residence and domicile. She further acknowledged that her intent had been to return to Rhode Island and stay in West Warwick after she completed her work on the project in France; she added that, in actuality, her work on the project was never completed.', 'At the conclusion of that February 15, 2010 hearing, the trial justice issued a decision from the bench.

Lori further testified that, on the next day (June 24), she would be beginning work in a new position; she added that she had previously been self-employed as an interior designer. She also stated that, in order to support herself, she had been relying on loans from her parents and the remaining funds in her savings and checking accounts.', 'Lori further testified with respect to her understanding of Patrick‘s financial situation during the course of their marriage. She said that Patrick had relied on interest from investments as income. She also stated that Patrick had sold a number of radio stations to a buyer for an amount ―in excess of ten million‖4 and that he received periodic payments as a result of that sale.

The trial justice allowed Patrick a $10,000 credit of equitable assignment which could be recouped from Lori‘s share of the sale of the property in France. The trial justice further ordered Patrick to pay Lori $20,000 as an advancement of equitable assignment, which the trial justice allowed might be a credit against Lori‘s share of the proceeds from the sale of the house in France. The trial justice also found that Patrick would be required to make a reasonable contribution towards Lori‘s counsel fees, the amount of which would be determined after a hearing.

Patrick filed a timely appeal of the order and judgment concerning counsel fees.', 'Lori‘s attorney also filed a motion to adjudge Patrick in contempt for having violated the prior order of the court restraining him from proceeding with a divorce in another jurisdiction, which motion was heard by the trial justice on October 4, 2010. In an order entered November 29, 2010, the trial justice found that Patrick was in contempt of his order enjoining and restraining Patrick from proceeding with a divorce action in France or in any other jurisdiction, and he directed Lori‘s attorney to present evidence with respect to counsel fees that might be imposed with respect to that contempt finding. Patrick filed a timely appeal of that order.', 'Upon receipt of a fee affidavit from Lori‘s attorney and after a hearing on the matter on November 29, 2010, an order entered on December 1, 2010 indicating (1) that counsel fees (with respect to the preparation for and appearance at the October 4, 2010 hearing) in the amount of $2,925 were fair and reasonable and (2) that each party was responsible for 50 percent thereof ($1,437.50). The trial justice, in that order, denied Patrick‘s motion for a stay.

He erroneously focused on Lori‘s intent7 rather than on the more objective facts that should be scrutinized in determining a person‘s residency. Even though the record before us in this case permits us to affirm on other grounds the trial justice‘s conclusion as to Lori‘s residency,8 we pause to clarify the appropriate standard for such findings.', 'It is clear that the determination of residency in divorce cases in this state does not depend on the intent of the plaintiff. In fact, intent is the sole element distinguishing residency from domicile—both of which are required in order for subject matter jurisdiction to lie in the Family Court. See, e.g., DeBlois v. Clark, 764 A.2d 727, 734 (R.I. 2001) (―[I]n order to 7', 'In rendering his decision on Patrick‘s motion to dismiss, the trial justice stated that the ―question [was] did she intend by her time away from the State of Rhode Island to have absented herself from Rhode Island to such a degree that she is no longer a resident herein.‖ The trial justice then noted that the court was ―satisfied‖ that Lori ―never intended to be anything other than a resident and domiciliary of Rhode Island despite the fact that she spent 172 days in southern France working on a project for a vacation home that she does, in fact, own with her current husband.‖ 8', 'On numerous occasions, this Court has affirmed trial court rulings on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial court.

Accordingly, although the trial justice‘s focus on Lori‘s intent was misplaced, we nonetheless affirm his determination that the Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce for the below-mentioned reasons.', '3', 'The Residency Issue', 'The initial and sine qua non question which we must resolve with respect to this case is whether Lori ―ha[d] resided in this state for a period of one year next before the filing of [her] complaint‖ for divorce from Patrick, specifically from April of 2008 to April of 2009. See G.L. 1956 § 15-5-12. The just-cited provision of the General Laws is the controlling statute with respect to the Family Court‘s subject matter jurisdiction over divorce actions. See Rogers, 18 A.3d at 493 (noting that ―[t]he Family Court was established by the General Assembly as a court of limited jurisdiction‖ and further noting that ―subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to petitions for divorce is governed by § 15-5-12(a)‖). Section 15-5-12(a) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―No complaint for divorce * * * shall be granted unless the', 'plaintiff has been a domiciled inhabitant of this state and has', 'resided in this state for a period of one year next before the filing', 'of the complaint * * *.‖', '- 17 - In the divorce context, the residency requirement is separate and apart from the domicile requirement. See id. At no point does title 15 define the meaning of ―resided.‖9', 'We have previously held that, in order to satisfy the statutory residency requirement in the divorce context, there must be on plaintiff‘s part ―an actual and continuous residence and dwelling within this state for the prescribed period, which must immediately precede the filing of the petition.‖ McCarthy, 45 R.I. at 369–70, 122 A. at 531; see also Doerner v.

It is noteworthy that the related term ―resident‖ has been legislatively defined in various ways in several other statutes unrelated to the divorce context. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 23-24.4-3 (defining, in the context of the Hazardous Substances Community Right to Know Act, a ―Resident‖ as ―any person whose principal domicile is located in the state‖); G.L. 1956 § 20-2.2-3 (defining, in the context of recreational saltwater fishing licenses, a ―Resident‖ as ―an individual who has had his or her actual place of residence and has lived in the state of Rhode Island for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months‖); G.L. 1956 § 27-2.4-2 (defining, in the context of producer licensing, a ―Resident‖ as ―a person who either resides in Rhode Island or maintains an office in Rhode Island * * * and designates Rhode Island as the residence for purposes of licensure‖); G.L. 1956 § 27-34.3-5 (defining, in the context of life and health insurance guarantees, a ―Resident‖ as ―a person to whom a contractual obligation is owed and who resides in this state on the date of entry of court order * * *.

Root, 57 R.I. 436, 440, 190 A. 450, 452 (1937). It is clear that ―such a finding should not be disturbed by this [C]ourt, unless it clearly fails to do justice between the parties, or is clearly erroneous.‖ Id. at 441, 190 A. at 452.', 'In McCarthy, this Court considered whether or not the plaintiff, who had filed for divorce in Rhode Island, had satisfied the residency requirement. In that case, when the plaintiff was absent from Rhode Island, she was located in New York City or ―on the road‖ for the purpose of pursuing her profession. See McCarthy, 45 R.I. at 368, 122 A. at 530. She visited Rhode Island on weekends and had ―lived‖ in Rhode Island in one or the other of two hotels, ―where her mail [had] been sent, and from there [had] been forwarded to her * * *.‖ Id. In addition, she spent between five and eight weeks in the summer in Rhode Island for vacation. See id. This Court determined that the plaintiff‘s presence in the state was not sufficient to ―maintain her residence for the required length of time.‖ Id. at 370, 122 A. at 531. The Court noted in McCarthy that the petitioner ―actually lived within the state only a relatively small part of each year‖; it concluded that her justified absences did ―not excuse the failure to fulfill the statutory requirement of actual and continuous residence.‖ Id. at 371, 122 A. at 531.', 'It is also noteworthy, however, that this Court in McCarthy specifically stated that ―[n]ot every departure and absence from the state is to be held as a legal interruption of the continuity of residence required by the statute.‖ McCarthy, 45 R.I. at 370–71, 122 A. at 531.

See Root, 57 R.I. at 437, 190 A. at 451. In making its determination, the Court summarized the evidence before it, indicating that the plaintiff had rented a room in Providence in 1932 (the petition for divorce was filed in 1935) for the stated purpose of becoming a domiciled inhabitant in order to procure a divorce. Id. at 439, 190 A. at 451. The plaintiff stayed in Providence for an average of three or four nights a week, and he remained in Massachusetts at his sister‘s home for an average of one to two nights a week.', 'Id.', 'He additionally spent a night or two per week in a second apartment in Massachusetts. Id. The Court noted that the plaintiff‘s room in Providence ―was comfortably furnished and he kept there his clothing and other personal effects‖; that he ―received mail there all the time‖; and that he ―registered his [car] in Rhode Island and afterwards registered for voting in Providence.‖ Id. at 439, 190 A. at 452. In addition, the Court noted that the plaintiff had paid taxes in Rhode Island and had lived in Providence for about eight years prior to the separation from his wife. Id. The Court also noted that the plaintiff kept his bank accounts in Boston. Id. at 440, 190 A. at 452. The Court affirmed the finding as to domicile and residence. Id. at 441, 190 A. at 452.', 'Although the issue in Root was domicile rather than residence, it should be recalled that the difference between residence and domicile is merely the additional element of intent. See DeBlois, 764 A.2d at 734. Therefore, the Court‘s reasoning as to the weight to be accorded to the trial justice‘s finding of fact is equally applicable to determinations of both issues. Accordingly, we consider the language from our opinion in Root to be fully applicable to the trial justice‘s finding of fact concerning the residency issue in the case at bar:', '―[The trial justice‘s decision] was based almost entirely on', 'testimony given before the trial justice, where he had the great', '- 20 -', 'advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.

See Root, 57 R.I. at 439, 190 A. at 451–52; McCarthy, 45 R.I. at 368, 122 A. at 530–31.', 'Similar to the situations in Root and McCarthy, the record in this case contains evidence with respect to the majority of the factual considerations that this Court has historically alluded to when analyzing residency. Most critical to our decision, the record includes many of the above-mentioned facts (and, notably, those facts were not contested by Patrick). Lori testified that her ―permanent residence has always been in West Warwick,‖ but that, during the critical one year period before she filed her complaint for divorce, she had been living in France for 172 days working as an interior designer and project manager for the renovation of the parties‘ vacation home. The record further reflects that Lori was present in Rhode Island beginning in November of 2008 until the date of the filing for divorce on April 22, 2009. Lori testified that', '- 21 - she filed Rhode Island state tax returns for 2007 and 2008 and that she was registered to vote in the state. The record, however, is silent as to where she received her mail and whether or to where her mail was forwarded.', 'The record indicates that Lori had a physical address in Rhode Island, even though she did not have a lease and did not pay rent. We also note that, according to her testimony at trial, Lori owned a vehicle in this state. She additionally testified that she kept her jewelry and certain clothing items at the West Warwick address and also that she maintained certain paintings and furniture at that address. Her uncontested testimony touches on virtually all of the facts upon which this Court has focused for decades when dealing with the residency or domicile issue.', 'Acknowledging that the ease and necessity of travel have greatly increased since the issuance of the McCarthy and Root decisions several decades ago, we are of the view that Lori had resided in Rhode Island for the year prior to her divorce filing sufficient to meet the subject matter jurisdiction requirements of the pertinent statute.', 'B', 'Rehabilitative Alimony', 'The grant of alimony is authorized by statute. See § 15-5-16(a). That statute states that its purpose ―is designed to provide support for a spouse for a reasonable length of time to enable the recipient to become financially independent and self-sufficient.‖ Section 15-5-16(c)(2).

See Thompson, 642 A.2d at 1164. He first dealt with the division of marital property and personalty, and he then determined that there should be an award of alimony in the amount that he deemed appropriate—limiting the period of alimony to three years. In doing so, he considered (without explicitly referencing each statutory factor) the amount of time that the parties had been married; the conclusion (based on the non-sworn response to the Request for Admissions) that Patrick had not been faithful to Lori during the marriage; and the contributions from the assets of each party towards the purchase and development of the property in France. The trial justice additionally considered the couple‘s lifestyle; the fact that Lori had ceased working in her profession; and the state of their finances at the time of the divorce. In addition, he considered the income of Patrick and his ability to acquire future income. The trial justice also considered Lori‘s age and the state of her health as well as her ability to work, even though she had not been employed during the marriage. Based upon these factors, the trial justice found that Lori was ―in need of rehabilitative alimony for a period of three years.‖ The trial justice reviewed Lori‘s request and her estimated expenses, which Lori contended amounted to $1,789.27 per week. The trial justice ultimately awarded Lori $1,250 per week after finding that Patrick had the ability to pay that amount.', 'We note that the trial justice reviewed all of the statutory factors before concluding that rehabilitative alimony (albeit at a level significantly less than Lori had requested) was warranted. After carefully reviewing the record, we perceive no basis for ruling that the trial justice abused his discretion in awarding rehabilitative alimony in this case or in determining the amount and', '- 24 - duration of such alimony.

On appeal, Patrick contends that the order enjoining him from proceeding with a foreign divorce ―merge[d]‖ into the interlocutory decision pending entry of final judgment of September 15, 2010, and it was therefore no longer in effect at the time when Lori‘s motion to adjudge him in contempt was filed.13', 'We need not (and therefore shall not) reach Patrick‘s contention that, because the interlocutory decision does not mention the 2010 injunction, said injunction thereby ceased to be in effect—because it is clear that the contemptuous conduct at issue here (namely, Patrick‘s March 21, 2010 filing of divorce proceedings in France) occurred prior to the entry of the interlocutory decision pending entry of final judgment. It is equally clear that Patrick‘s conduct explicitly violated the terms of the Family Court‘s order enjoining him from proceeding with a divorce in a foreign jurisdiction. We are hard-pressed to envision a clearer or more brazen case of contemptuous conduct, and we note that it is consistent with Patrick‘s course of conduct throughout the proceedings in the Family Court. Accordingly, we readily hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding Patrick in contempt; we perceive absolutely no basis for disturbing the contempt finding or the sanctions imposed.

7,(P2/05-1869A) State : v. : Derrick R. Oliver. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Derrick R. Oliver, appeals after being convicted of five criminal counts. On appeal, the defendant raises two issues. First, he argues that the trial court erred when it did not dismiss the charges against him after the state allegedly failed to comply with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (the IADA or the act), G.L. 1956 chapter 13 of title 13. Specifically, the defendant, who was a prisoner in Massachusetts, contends that he should have been brought to trial in Rhode Island within 180 days after receipt of his request for a final disposition of the charges against him. Second, the defendant argues that his convictions for both larceny and assault with a dangerous weapon violated the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal relates to two criminal cases that were eventually consolidated for trial. On June 23, 2005, the state filed a criminal information in the Superior Court for Providence County charging defendant with (1) domestic assault with a dangerous weapon (a motor vehicle), (2) assault with a dangerous weapon (a motor vehicle), and (3) violation of a protective order issued by the Family Court (P2/05-1869A). Those charges arose from an incident on September 21, 2004; it was alleged that defendant had purposefully followed and rear-ended a car in which his ex-girlfriend and a friend of hers were the occupants.', 'On October 28, 2005, a Providence County grand jury indicted defendant for (1) first degree robbery, (2) assault with a dangerous weapon (a knife), and (3) violating a no-contact order (P1/05-3178A). Those charges related to an incident that occurred in a parking lot on April 25, 2005; it was alleged that defendant had stabbed the same ex-girlfriend with a knife and repeatedly hit her face against the ground as she was trying to enter her car after work. It was further alleged that defendant had then taken his ex-girlfriend‘s purse and cell phone and had driven off in her car.', 'On July 27, 2005, defendant was arrested in Fall River, Massachusetts; he was thereafter tried and convicted in Massachusetts on a separate assault charge.1 In a letter dated January 13, 2006 (the detainer), the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General notified the Bristol County House of Corrections (the Massachusetts institution in which defendant was imprisoned) that there were outstanding arrest warrants relating to the two above-referenced Rhode Island 1', 'The defendant‘s ex-girlfriend, who was the alleged victim in the two Rhode Island cases at issue in the present appeal, was also the victim involved in the Massachusetts assault case.', '-2- criminal cases. The detainer went on to ask that defendant be advised of his ―right to make a request for final disposition‖ of the Rhode Island charges pursuant to the IADA; that act provides that a defendant must be brought to trial within 180 days after ―he or she shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court * * * written notice of the place of his or her imprisonment and his or her request for a final disposition * * *.‖ Section 13-13-2, art. III(a).', 'At some time after the January 13, 2006 detainer was sent, the state received defendant‘s request for disposition under the IADA. On May 5, 2006, defendant was arraigned in Rhode Island with respect to P2/05-1869A and P1/05-3178A. On April 26, 2007—almost a year after his arraignment—defendant filed motions to dismiss with respect to both cases; he contended that dismissal was required because the criminal charges against him had ―not been disposed of within the time period mandated by‖ the IADA.', 'On May 15, 2007, the state objected to defendant‘s motions, and the Superior Court held a hearing on that same day. At the hearing, the motion justice denied defendant‘s motion to dismiss, reasoning that the continuances that had been obtained by defendant made it ―unreasonable to expect that the case [would] be tried‖ within the IADA timeline.', 'On May 31, 2007, the Superior Court consolidated the two cases for trial. On November 6, 2007, defendant filed a motion requesting that the court reconsider its May 15 decision denying the motion to dismiss. In his motion for reconsideration, defendant reiterated his argument that, since trial had not commenced within the time frame mandated by the IADA, the case must be dismissed. The defendant also requested an evidentiary hearing with respect to the IADA issues.', '-3-', 'On April 24, 2008, after extensive briefing and after hearing oral arguments by both parties, the motion justice issued a written decision denying defendant‘s motion to reconsider. Regarding defendant‘s request for an evidentiary hearing, the motion justice noted that, when litigating defendant‘s initial motion to dismiss, defense counsel had ―opted to rely on the [c]ourt documents and docket sheets in determining the travel of the case.‖ The motion justice stated that defense counsel had made ―a tactical decision‖ that ―[could not] be revisited‖; accordingly, he denied defendant‘s request for an evidentiary hearing.', 'The motion justice then turned to the merits of defendant‘s motion to reconsider. The court noted that it was ―difficult for [the court] to calculate when the one hundred eighty (180) day deadline would have expired because none of the three[2] case files contain[ed] a request from the Defendant seeking disposition of the pending charges.‖ The motion justice recognized, however, that one of the case files included a document filed with the court on April 26, 2006. He noted that the document ―seem[ed] to indicate that custody was offered to Rhode Island at the request of the Defendant‖ on April 17, 2006. The motion justice‘s decision stated that, ―[i]f the [April 17 request was] accurate, the one hundred eighty (180) days began to run on April 17, 2006.‖ The motion justice then stated that, regardless of the exact date on which the 180-day deadline began to run, it was clear that defendant was not brought to trial within the time frame provided for in the IADA.', 'The motion justice went on to find that the case had been ―continued nineteen times before the Defendant moved to dismiss the charges for untimely prosecution.‖ The motion justice further found that thirteen of those continuances were attributable to defendant and that 2', 'In addition to the two criminal cases that defendant is challenging on appeal, the state had filed charges against defendant in a third case; the Superior Court eventually dismissed those charges.', '-4- four of those thirteen continuances were for the purpose of allowing defendant ―to consider offers by the prosecution to dispose of the cases by way of a plea agreement.‖ The motion justice denied defendant‘s motion to reconsider, ruling as follows:', '―The Defendant cannot be permitted to request numerous', 'continuances and then move for dismissal when the trial does not', 'occur within the proscribed time period. Permitting him to do so', 'would undermine the judicial system, and would allow a defendant', 'to avoid prosecution through his own delay.‖', 'On September 15, 2008, defendant filed another motion to dismiss, which was unrelated to his earlier IADA motions. This most recent motion contended that the charges against defendant for both first degree robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon in P1/05-3178A should be dismissed ―on the grounds of double jeopardy.‖ The defendant argued that the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon would ―not require proof of a fact that is not already required to be proved as part of the robbery.‖', 'On March 11, 2009—the day before trial began—the justice of the Superior Court who would be presiding over the trial conducted a hearing on defendant‘s double jeopardy motion. After listening to arguments from both parties, the trial justice, noting that she would be sitting without a jury,3 deferred her ruling on defendant‘s motion; she stated that she would ―address [the motion] if it becomes pertinent as time goes on.‖', 'The defendant‘s three-day bench trial began on March 12, 2009.', 'On March 16, defendant was convicted of domestic assault with a dangerous weapon and assault with a dangerous weapon in P2/05-1869A (involving charges which stemmed from the motor vehicle incident on September 21, 2004).4 As for P1/05-3178A (involving charges which stemmed from 3', 'The defendant waived his right to a jury trial at the March 11, 2009 hearing. 4', 'The charge in P2/05-1869A relating to an alleged violation of a protective order was dismissed by the trial justice after the state tried (unsuccessfully) to amend that charge to reflect', '-5- the incident in the parking lot on April 25, 2005), defendant was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon and violating a no-contact order.', 'With respect to the robbery charge in P1/05-3178A, the trial justice requested further briefing from the parties on the double jeopardy argument that had been raised in defendant‘s pretrial motion to dismiss.', 'On May 21, 2009, after the requested additional briefs were filed, the Superior Court convicted defendant of the lesser included offense of larceny.', 'The trial court, in finding defendant guilty of larceny rather than robbery, stated:', '―Although the defendant committed the theft of the purse and car,', 'grabbing the keys, within a short time frame after he completed the', 'assault with a dangerous weapon on [his ex-girlfriend], it was a', 'subsequent event.

In P1/05- 3178A, defendant was sentenced as follows: (1) for larceny, ten years, with one year to serve, nine years suspended with probation; (2) for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon, twenty years to serve (to be served concurrently with the larceny sentence and consecutively to the sentences imposed in P2/05-1869A); and (3) for the violation of a no-contact order, one year to serve (to be served consecutively to all sentences).', '-6-', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The IADA Contention', 'The defendant argues that, because the state did not bring him to trial within 180 days of its receipt of his request for disposition, the state thereby failed to comply with the IADA, and his case should have been dismissed. We disagree.', 'This Court reviews de novo a trial court‘s denial of a motion to dismiss based on the IADA deadlines. State v. Clifton, 777 A.2d 1272, 1279 (R.I. 2001). However, we accord deference to the factual findings which underlie such a decision. State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 191 (R.I. 2003).', 'The IADA is an interstate compact 6 among participating states which is ―designed to expedite the trial of criminal charges pending in one state (the receiving state) while the person is incarcerated in another state (the sending state).‖ Werner, 831 A.2d at 191.

III(a).', 'The IADA further provides that, if a defendant‘s trial does not begin within the above- referenced time frame, then the court must dismiss the charges against the defendant. Section 13-13-2, art. V(c). However, that statutory mandate concerning dismissal of charges has been the subject of significant judicial construction; as a result, dismissal does not automatically occur every time that the 180-day period has run without a trial having begun. Indeed, we have expressly stated that the IADA ―was not designed to protect against delays caused by actions of a defendant.‖ State v. Shatney, 572 A.2d 872, 875, 876 (R.I. 1990) (upholding a trial court‘s denial of a motion to dismiss pursuant to the deadlines set forth in the IADA where the delay was due to continuances requested by the defendant). Rather, ―[t]he purpose of the [IADA] is to assure incarcerated defendants speedy trials and to protect them from delays in trial caused by prosecuting authorities.‖ State v. Lionberg, 533 A.2d 1172, 1179 (R.I. 1987) (emphasis added).', 'Assuming that the 180-day timeline began to run on April 17, 2006,7 the deadline for trial to begin would have been October 13, 2006. The defendant‘s trial did not begin until March 12, 7', 'In this case, it is unclear when (or if) the 180-day clock actually began to tick. The timeline begins once the out-of-state prisoner‘s request for final disposition ―has actually been delivered‖ to both the prosecuting officer and the court. Fex v. Michigan, 507 U.S. 43, 52 (1993). The motion justice found that ―[r]ecords at the Department of the Attorney General indicate that the State received notice from defendant on April 17, 2006.‖ As for notice to the court, the Superior Court files in P2/05-1869A and P1/05-3178A do not include defendant‘s request for a final disposition. The motion justice noted that the record contained a letter filed with the court on April 26, 2006 that ―seem[ed] to indicate that custody was offered to Rhode Island at the request of the Defendant.‖ That filing, however, does not technically satisfy the statute, which requires delivery of the request for disposition itself.', 'We note that the ―inmate bears the burden of demonstrating compliance with the formal procedural requirements of Article III.‖ United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 434 (1st Cir. 1991). Despite the lack of clear evidence as to when (or if) the court received defendant‘s', '-8- 2009. Those facts, however, do not tell the entire story. According to the timelines submitted by the parties to the motion justice,8 there were nine continuances granted by the court between April 17, 2006 and the deadline of October 13, 2006. The record that was before the motion justice reflects that six of those continuances were attributable to the actions of defendant: four included a request for a continuance that was made on behalf of defendant and two were due to the fact that defense counsel was court-excused. Applying to the facts of this case the principle that the IADA ―was not designed to protect against delays caused by actions of a defendant,‖ we hold that defendant should not be permitted to take advantage of the delays for which he was responsible. See Shatney, 572 A.2d at 875.', 'The remaining three continuances were requested by the state. The defendant, however, never objected to those continuances,9 nor did he ever raise the IADA deadline during any of the nine hearings on the continuances.', 'Given defendant‘s failure to ever raise his IADA argument before the deadline expired (despite having had numerous opportunities to bring it to the court‘s attention), it is our opinion that he forfeited that argument. As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit stated in United States v. Dowdell, 595 F.3d 50, 64 (1st Cir. 2010):', '―We do not look favorably on [IADA] arguments that are', 'not raised until the trial judge is no longer in a position to avoid a request for disposition, we shall follow the trial justice‘s lead and assume (without deciding) that the IADA clock began to run on April 17, 2006. 8', 'The motion justice found that those timelines ―serve[d] as an accurate summary of the continuances granted in this case.‖ 9', 'A transcript submitted to the motion justice indicates that defense counsel had ―No objection‖ to the state‘s first request. As to the state‘s second request, defense counsel stated: ―I don‘t mind a week continuance, your Honor.‖ As for the state‘s third request for a continuance, defense counsel voiced no objection.', '-9-', 'violation.

In our judgment, a defendant should not be permitted to ask for and assent to continuance after continuance and then seek to suddenly ensnare the state and the court in a ―gotcha‖ moment once an IADA deadline has passed. See id.; see also Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1203 (1st Cir. 1987) (―The law ministers to the vigilant not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.‖).', 'The defendant also argues that the continuances did not affect the IADA deadline because the act provides for extensions only ―for good cause shown in open court.‖ The United States Supreme Court, however, has recognized that the ―good cause‖ provision ―is, by clear implication, the sole means by which the prosecution can obtain an extension of the time limits over the defendant‘s objection.‖ New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 116 (2000) (emphasis added). In this case, defendant never objected to the continuances sought by the prosecution.', 'This case simply ―does not present a situation in which a defendant is banging on the court house doors demanding that he be tried immediately.‖ See State v. Moosey, 504 A.2d 1001, 1003–04 (R.I. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted) (rejecting a defendant‘s argument 10', 'The defendant attempts to distinguish the Dowdell case that is cited in the text by noting that the defendant in that case ―never moved to dismiss in the trial court on IADA grounds.‖ While that is true, the First Circuit‘s opinion does not rely on that point. Instead, the Dowdell opinion turns on the fact that the defendant ―obscure[d] [an IADA deadline] * * * and avoid[ed] clear objection until the clock ha[d] run‖—which is exactly what happened in the case that is now before us.

On appeal, the defendant argues that conviction on those two charges violated his constitutional rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.11 Again, we disagree.', 'Our analysis of an alleged error based on double jeopardy principles ―is a mixed question of law and fact of constitutional dimension; thus, our review is de novo.‖ State v. Stone, 924 A.2d 773, 778 (R.I. 2007). However, within that review, ―we still accord a hearing justice‘s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference * * *.‖ Rice v.

He contends that the ―charge of assault with a dangerous weapon was clearly a lesser-included offense[12] of robbery‖ and that, therefore, he could not have been convicted on both counts. It is true that, given the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, a defendant cannot be punished for both a greater and lesser included offense based on the same act. E.g., State v. Tessier, 589 A.2d 1199, 1200 (R.I. 1991).', 'Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon was a lesser included offense of the robbery charge, defendant‘s argument overlooks a critical fact: he was not convicted of robbery.

The defendant, Marcus Huffman, appeals from a judgment of conviction following a lengthy trial, at the conclusion of which the jury found him guilty of first degree sexual assault stemming from an incident that occurred in March of 2007. The justice of the Superior Court who had presided over the trial sentenced the defendant to sixty years, with forty years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions and with twenty years suspended with probation. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Incident of March 17–18, 20071', 'Based upon the testimony and other evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the afternoon of March 17, 2007, the nineteen-year-old complaining witness, whom we shall refer to pseudonymously as Cindy, was at her apartment in Fall River, Massachusetts, with her girlfriend and Cindy‘s sister; they spent some time smoking marijuana. At some point, Cindy‘s friend, Ryan Borges, arrived at the apartment; she left with him to pick up another friend, and they then went to Ryan‘s house. At approximately 8:30 p.m., Cindy‘s brother, Tyrone, arrived at Ryan‘s house, where Cindy, Ryan, and three other persons were already present. While at Ryan‘s house, Cindy drank alcohol (Red Bull mixed with liquor, and three shots each of vodka, rum, and cognac), and she shared four ―blunts.‖2 Cindy changed into a white ―muscle shirt,‖ a white long-sleeved T-shirt, a red shirt, jeans, a fitted hat, and sneakers. They then decided to go to a club in Providence called Platforms. Cindy testified that, before leaving Ryan‘s house, she felt ―woozey.‖ Tyrone considered Cindy to have been ―drunk‖ while still at Ryan‘s apartment; he noticed that she was stumbling and that her eyes were ―red,‖ ―watery,‖ and ―glazy.‖', 'Tyrone testified that, once they arrived at the club, Cindy was ―stumbling‖ and ―slurring her words.‖ 1', 'The facts contained within Part I A of this opinion are derived from the testimony of various witnesses and from several of the numerous exhibits; the jurors heard testimony for approximately fifteen days, and some twenty witnesses testified. 2', 'Cindy described the ―blunts,‖ which are referred to in the text, as cigars that had been cut open and filled with marijuana. See also In re Destiney L., 21 A.3d 279, 281 n.5 (R.I. 2011) (―‗Blunt‘ is a slang term for a hollowed out cigar filled with marijuana.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)).', '-2-', 'At some point near midnight, the group arrived at the entrance to Platforms. However, Cindy was not permitted to enter the club because (according to the owner of the nightclub and the owner of the security company that staffed the nightclub) she was too intoxicated. The rest of the group went into the club for approximately forty-five minutes. Cindy‘s companions had instructed her to wait for them in Ryan‘s car in the parking lot. However, Cindy chose not to wait in Ryan‘s car; she instead remained outside the club, near the entrance. While there, she noticed a police cruiser, the driver of which was speaking to the club‘s owner, Joseph Manfredi. Mr. Manfredi, who at trial identified defendant as that driver, saw Cindy walk over to defendant‘s cruiser.', 'The police officer, whom Cindy identified in court as defendant, had called her over to the window of the cruiser and told her that she had to leave the club‘s property due to her intoxication. When she told him that she did not have anywhere to go, the police officer told her to enter the front seat of the cruiser. Cindy proceeded to get into the cruiser because she ―trusted him.‖', 'Cindy told defendant that she needed to use a restroom; defendant then drove her to what she described as a ―brick‖ building, which building was later identified as being a police substation. Key card logs were used to monitor entries to the police substation, and monitoring was also conducted by surveillance cameras. Both the key card log and the surveillance footage indicated that defendant and Cindy entered the building at approximately 12:40 a.m. on March 18.', 'Cindy testified that, after entering the bathroom stall, her next memory was of waking up on the floor of the building—without her sports bra or boxer shorts on. She added that her pants were unbuckled and the zipper was pulled down. Cindy testified that she had felt pain in her', '-3- vagina, both inside and outside, and also in her back, her arms, and her thighs. Cindy said that her vagina felt swollen and that she ―just knew something was wrong‖; she added that she felt as though she were ―leaking.‖ She managed to leave the building on foot and to find her way to her aunt‘s house, which was not far away.', 'Cindy remembered nothing that happened between the time of her arrival at her aunt‘s house and the moment when she woke up in the hospital. According to her aunt, Josephine Saygbe, Cindy told her that she had been ―raped by a cop.‖ Her aunt called the police. The defendant was one of three patrolmen who responded to the aunt‘s home. The other two patrolmen noticed that, at the aunt‘s house, Cindy was very upset and appeared intoxicated. An EMT from the Providence Fire Department also responded to the aunt‘s house; the EMT examined Cindy and then transported her to Women and Infants Hospital. The defendant also went to that hospital, as did the other two patrolmen who had responded to the aunt‘s home.', 'Upon Cindy‘s arrival at Women and Infants Hospital, the physicians there determined that she was too intoxicated for them to perform a sexual assault kit at that time. Cindy stated that, when she used a bathroom in the hospital, she noticed bright red blood; she added that the blood was not the same color as that associated with her menstrual period, which had begun earlier that day.', 'Cindy was transferred to Rhode Island Hospital, where blood tests were conducted. She tested positive for marijuana and she had a blood alcohol level of 0.174 at 4:28 a.m. on March 18. In due course, a sexual assault kit was performed at Rhode Island Hospital. There was divergent testimony at trial regarding the examination of Cindy: as we shall explain, the testimony of the resident who performed the sexual assault kit, of the certified nursing assistant (CNA) who assisted him, and of a sexual assault expert differed in several respects.', '-4-', 'Doctor Keith Corl, a first-year resident, performed the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection kit and completed a report. He noted that Cindy complained of vaginal pain. He testified that he did not observe any trauma to the vagina. He further testified that he observed blood coming from Cindy‘s ―cervical os,‖ which he said was consistent with menstruation. He did not observe symptoms consistent with penetration; therefore, based upon the sexual assault kit results, he could not testify that vaginal penetration had occurred shortly prior to his examination of Cindy. It should be noted that it is undisputed that, years prior, Cindy had had sexual intercourse with a boyfriend.', 'Patricia Cragg, a certified nursing assistant, also testified at trial. She testified that she acted as the ―chaperone‖ for Dr. Corl while he completed the sexual assault kit; she did not conduct any tests or otherwise examine Cindy. She handed the doctor the proper materials (such as swabs and tests) and sealed the various items that he handed to her. CNA Cragg testified that she observed that Cindy‘s vagina was swollen and inflamed and that there was bleeding.', 'Doctor Christine Barron, who was qualified as an expert in the field of sexual abuse, testified at trial; she gave her testimony over defendant‘s objection (which had also been the subject of a motion in limine). Doctor Barron had been retained by the prosecution to review Cindy‘s case. She reviewed all of the medical records for March 18, 2007, Cindy‘s previous medical records, State Police investigative reports (which included multiple witness statements), and the grand jury transcripts of Cindy‘s testimony. Doctor Barron also interviewed Cindy and performed a physical examination of her on May 21, 2007; the physical examination revealed that there had previously been ―penetrating vagina trauma to cause trauma to the hymen with loss of tissue there.‖ Doctor Barron also testified that the manner in which Dr. Corl had performed the sexual assault kit and recorded his findings fell below what she considered to be', '-5- the standard of care. Doctor Barron testified that, based upon Cindy‘s complaints of vaginal pain and the reports of bleeding, swelling, and bright red blood, the evidence from March 18 was consistent with ―acute penetrating vaginal trauma.‖', 'Testimony at trial, based upon DNA evidence, indicated that defendant‘s seminal fluid was present on the inside of the boxer shorts that Cindy had been wearing on the evening of March 17, 2007. In addition, video stills showing Cindy following defendant into the substation in the early morning of March 18 were entered into evidence; evidence of defendant‘s key card having been used to access the police substation on March 17 and March 18 was also admitted.', 'Other facts relevant to the appeal will be provided as necessary in the course of this opinion.', 'B', 'The Criminal Proceedings', 'On August 1, 2007, a statewide grand jury indicted defendant, alleging that, on March 18, 2007, he ―engage[d] in sexual penetration, to wit, vaginal penetration, with [the complaining witness], a woman not his spouse, at a time when he knew or had reason to know that she was mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled, or physically helpless, in violation of‖ G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. (The denial of that motion is one of the issues that defendant raises on appeal.)', 'The defendant‘s trial began in March of 2010 and lasted for approximately a month. During defendant‘s trial, the trial justice decided two substantive motions (which are also subjects of defendant‘s appeal)—viz., a motion to pass the case and a motion in limine to exclude testimony.', '-6-', '1', 'The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment', 'On May 14, 2008, long before the trial began, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment because of defects in the grand jury record; he contended that the recording of the grand jury proceedings contained ―significant gaps in testimony‖ and was, ―for the most part, inaudible.‖ The defendant argued that those gaps and other inaudible testimony violated his right to due process because he was not provided with a sufficient record of the grand jury proceedings. On September 3, 2009, defendant‘s attorney and the prosecutor appeared for a hearing on defendant‘s motion to dismiss the indictment (or, in the alternative, to preclude witnesses who testified before the grand jury from testifying at trial). The motion justice3 noted the following about the grand jury record: ―There are numerous instances within the transcript where a witness‘[s] testimony was inaudible and it is so reported in those words and in the transcript.‖ The motion justice considered the record and the testimony ―in its totality,‖ and he determined that defendant was on notice as to what type of testimony was absent from the record and that defendant could have inferred the essence of the missing testimony based upon the exhibits attached to the proceedings and other surrounding context. He then denied defendant‘s motion.', '2', 'The Defendant’s Motion to Pass the Case Based upon Rule 16 Violations', 'While she was being cross-examined at trial, Cindy testified that she had spoken multiple times to the lead investigator, Sgt. Michelle Kershaw of the Rhode Island State Police. Defense counsel objected, citing Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial 3', 'We note that the motion justice who presided over defendant‘s motion to dismiss the indictment was not the justice who presided over the trial.', '-7- justice allowed examination of the lead investigator to determine whether the fact of Cindy‘s multiple conversations with Sgt. Kershaw had been disclosed. The cross-examination of Cindy continued and then concluded, at which point the prosecutor proceeded to redirect the witness concerning certain portions of her testimony. During that redirect examination, the prosecutor, referring to the police substation in which the sexual assault had allegedly occurred, asked Cindy whether she had ―been back inside that building since this happened.‖ The record of the redirect examination continues as follows:', '―A Um, I had to go in there once to just show it to some—I don‘t', 'know the guy‘s, like what their job is, but I had to show it to some', 'guys in the beginning. Then I‘ve never been back.', '―Q So do you mean right after you reported this, you took', 'somebody there?', '―A I had to show—some guys came in to me to take pictures of', 'the building or something to show them where I was at. I had to', 'show them where I went, like direct them.', '―Q Were you with Detective Kershaw?', '―A I believe so.', '―Q Okay. But other than since around the time that this occurred', 'back in 2007, have you been back in that building?', '―A No.', '―Q Okay.‖ After that portion of testimony, defense counsel asked for a sidebar conference. Both parties agreed that Cindy‘s testimony about returning to the building had been unexpected. Defense counsel argued that that information was ―discoverable material‖ which should have been turned over to the defense. The prosecutor finished her redirect examination of Cindy, and the parties returned to the issue of whether additional information should have been turned over to the defense. The trial justice delayed ruling on the alleged Rule 16 violation until Sgt. Kershaw could examine her notes for additional information that had not previously been disclosed.', 'Sergeant Kershaw located a number of pages of notes in her possession; almost sixty pages were then turned over to the defense. Sergeant Kershaw‘s notes made reference to a', '-8- number of previously undisclosed facts, including the fact that Cindy had returned to the substation after the day of the incident at issue (which visit, defendant contended, sharpened her memory as to the physical features of the substation). In addition, the information revealed that an ultraviolet light test had been conducted in a bathroom at the substation; that test disclosed no fluids—a fact which, defendant contended, was clearly exculpatory and should have been previously disclosed.', 'Defense counsel moved to pass the case and also moved to dismiss the case. Over two days, the trial justice, the prosecutor, and defense counsel discussed each ―new‖ item from Sgt. Kershaw‘s notes and the arguments by each of the parties. Defense counsel argued that his motions should be granted based upon the ―volume and cumulative effect of the nondisclosure.‖ He argued that certain information gleaned from the notes (including the fact of Cindy‘s subsequent return to the substation) would require him to alter the defense strategy that he had decided upon during his lengthy preparation for the trial. Defense counsel conceded, however, that the prosecutor had likely not deliberately violated Rule 16. The trial justice noted that defense counsel had not made the same concession about deliberateness with respect to Sgt. Kershaw, and she also noted that counsel had ―suggest[ed] that Sergeant Kershaw of the State Police made selective disclosures to benefit the Prosecution.‖ The trial justice did not accept defense counsel‘s suggestion as to Sgt. Kershaw‘s motivation; instead, she found Sgt. Kershaw‘s ―omissions‖ to ―have been negligent but not deliberate.‖ With respect to Sgt. Kershaw‘s failure to have produced the information, the trial justice found that she ―did not do so in an effort to buttress the State‘s case.‖', 'In rendering her decision on defendant‘s motions, the trial justice found that ―there were violations of Rule 16.‖ After considering ―each and every item referred to in the 59 pages of', '-9- handwritten notes that had not been previously contained in a narrative or otherwise disclosed,‖ as well as the complaining witness‘s testimony and the email revealing the ultraviolet light test, the court determined that, ―in spite of the aforementioned failure to disclose information and material in a timely manner [and] in spite of the fact that it was disclosed at trial in this particular case,‖ defendant ―did not suffer prejudice.‖ The trial justice noted that the information gleaned from Sgt. Kershaw‘s notes was either not highly significant or did not require further investigation and was produced before the material ―would have been utilized by‖ defendant. She did, however, note one exception—namely, the ―information concerning the complaining witness‘[s] second visit to the substation.‖', 'In determining that defendant had not been prejudiced by the late disclosure of that information, the trial justice noted that the complaining witness was still on the witness stand and subject to further cross-examination. The court stated that it would ―permit broad recross-examination and [would] give the Defendant a full opportunity to question her on the issue of her second visit and on any other issue raised by the recent disclosures.‖ The trial justice additionally noted that defendant had not yet given an opening statement and therefore had not yet ―commit[ted] to a strategy that would have been altered by the disclosure.‖', 'With respect to defendant‘s motion to dismiss the indictment, the trial justice stated:', '―[A]bsent substantial prejudice and a showing that no other', 'available discretionary measure can possibly neutralize the harmful', 'effect of the Prosecutor‘s discovery violation, such remedy of', 'dismissal of the charge generally will be avoided. And that‘s the', 'case even when the Prosecution is guilty of gross negligent', 'misconduct.‖ With respect to defendant‘s motion to pass the case, the trial justice stated:', '―There‘s nothing here to suggest that counsel for the State goaded', 'the Defendant into a mistrial, which of course might impact on the', 'issue of double jeopardy. Criminal discovery rule seeks to', '- 10 -', '[promote] broader discovery by both sides in order to contribute to', 'the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice. It is highly', 'unfortunate that the State failed to provide full disclosure in a', 'timely fashion. However, that failure was inadvertent on the part', 'of the State, attorney for the State, and the Defendant has not been', 'prejudiced.‖', 'The trial justice denied both of defendant‘s motions on Thursday afternoon; she had sent the jurors home the day before (Wednesday), and she had asked them to return on Monday. The trial justice indicated her willingness to allow defense counsel as much time beyond Monday as he wished; however, defense counsel stated that he did not ―want the jury to attribute anything or suspect anything that‘s any delay based on the defense‖; he said that he would therefore be ready to proceed the following Monday.4', '3', 'The Defendant’s Motion in Limine to Exclude Dr. Barron’s Testimony', 'The defendant submitted a motion in limine, in which he sought to exclude the testimony of Dr. Christine Barron; the trial justice deferred ruling on that motion until later in the trial. In his memorandum of law submitted to the court, defendant contended that the state sought ―to present Dr. Barron cloaked in the garb of a medical expert only to bolster, vouch for and prop up the hearsay testimony of a CNA and the complaining witness to arrive at the conclusion that penetration took place on the morning of March 18, 2007.‖', 'The state‘s response to this contention was that the ―degree of conclusiveness goes to the weight to be afforded the opinion, not its admissibility.‖', 'Later in the trial and prior to permitting Dr. Barron to testify, the trial justice allowed a voir dire examination of Dr. Barron to be conducted. After the voir dire examination, defense 4', 'One of the remedies available to a trial justice, upon a finding of a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, is to grant a continuance. See Rule 16(i).', '- 11 - counsel argued (as a supplement to what he had contended in his written submission) that Dr. Barron‘s testimony constituted ―impermissible vouching under [Rule] 803.4 [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence].‖ He additionally argued that the bases for Dr. Barron‘s opinion were ―inherently unreliable‖ and that, therefore, her testimony was ―inherently tainted.‖ He asserted that the first mention of the ―bright red blood,‖ which was a basis for Dr. Barron‘s opinion that penetration had occurred, was at the grand jury, and not upon Cindy‘s presentation at the hospital. Additionally, he asserted that the ―opinion on redness and swelling‖ was based upon CNA Cragg‘s statement, which was made nineteen days after the incident, and appeared nowhere in the medical record. He further argued that, because Dr. Barron reviewed all of the evidence, including police reports, witness statements, DNA results, and her own examination of the complaining witness, she had only ―layers of hearsay‖ and no ―first-hand knowledge that [the complaining witness] had been sexually assaulted.‖ He asserted that, if Dr. Barron were allowed to testify as to the standard of care of Dr. Corl, her testimony would violate Rule 16 because that basis of her opinion had not been previously disclosed to defendant. He finally argued that, if permitted to ―testify as proffered by the State,‖ such testimony would be impermissible vouching.', 'The trial justice, in rendering her opinion, stated that she did not ―find any of her testimony vouching. Her report, yes, but not her testimony.‖ She then overruled the objection and denied the motion in limine.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant raises three issues on appeal. He asserts that the trial court erred: (1) in declining to dismiss the indictment based upon the partially inaudible and incomplete grand jury', '- 12 - record; (2) in not granting his motion to pass the case based upon Rule 16 violations by the state; and (3) in admitting the testimony of Dr. Christine Barron, which testimony he contends constituted impermissible vouching or bolstering of the complaining witness and CNA Cragg.', 'III', 'Standards of Review', 'With respect to a trial justice‘s decision on a motion to dismiss an indictment, we ―accord[] great weight to [the] trial justice‘s * * * findings [and] we will not set them aside unless they are clearly erroneous or fail to do justice between the parties.‖ State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 486 (R.I. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'With respect to the imposition of sanctions after a finding of a Rule 16 violation, we review a trial justice‘s ruling ―with deference and [we] will not overturn the decision unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.‖ State v. Gonzalez, 923 A.2d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 2007); see also State v. Garcia, 643 A.2d 180, 186 (R.I. 1994) (―[T]he determination of whether any harm has resulted from noncompliance with discovery motions and whether the harm can be mitigated is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.‖). We accord such deference to the trial justice in this context due to the fact that he or she ―is in the best position to determine an appropriate sanction for a Rule 16 violation.‖ Gonzalez, 923 A.2d at 1286.', 'We similarly review decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence under the abuse of discretion standard; we ―will not interfere with the trial justice‘s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.‖ See State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, we review ―a trial justice‘s ruling on the admissibility of an expert witness‘s proffered testimony‖ under the abuse of discretion standard. Id. at 153–54. Accordingly, we ―will sustain the ruling below provided that the trial justice‘s discretion has', '- 13 - been soundly and judicially exercised, that is, if it has been exercised in the light of reason applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action * * *.‖ Id. at 154 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment', 'Rule 6(e)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―All proceedings, except when the grand jury is deliberating or', 'voting, shall be recorded stenographically or by electronic', 'recording device. An unintentional failure of any recording to', 'reproduce all or any portion of a proceeding shall not affect the', 'validity of the prosecution. The recording or reporter‘s notes or', 'any transcript prepared therefrom shall remain in the custody or', 'control of the attorney for the State unless disclosed in the proper', 'discharge of his or her official duties or otherwise ordered by the', 'court in a particular case. In the event an indictment is not returned', 'any notes of a stenographer and transcriptions of such notes, and', 'any other recordings of the proceedings, shall be delivered to and', 'impounded by the court.‖ We have ―consistently declined to apply a per-se rule of dismissal of an indictment for violations of Rule 6(e).‖ State v. Cassey, 543 A.2d 670, 676 (R.I. 1988). We have also stated that ―dismissal as a sanction for an alleged irregularity during the grand jury proceeding is an extreme remedy that is unwarranted except in limited and very rare circumstances.‖', 'Id. However, defendant does not assert that an irregularity occurred during the grand jury proceedings.', 'Instead, defendant argues that the failure of the state to record the entire proceedings or provide a complete record of those proceedings prejudiced him in his trial preparation to the point that a dismissal of the indictment was required. Rule 6(e)(1) itself', '- 14 - clearly states otherwise: ―An unintentional failure of any recording to reproduce all or any portion of a proceeding shall not affect the validity of the prosecution.‖ (Emphasis added.) Here, there is no indication that the failure of the recording was intentional; accordingly, the gaps in the record shall not affect the validity of the prosecution.', 'In addition to adhering to the language of the rule itself, when reviewing a violation of Rule 6(e), we have cautioned against a trial court dismissing an indictment without looking to the ―nature or the effect [of the violation] upon the quantum of evidence presented to the grand jury, the presence or absence of exculpatory information, or the ability of the defense to use grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes.‖ See State v. Heredia, 493 A.2d 831, 834 (R.I. 1985). In this case, the motion justice made it clear that he had meticulously reviewed all of the grand jury transcripts.', 'He noted that there were ―numerous instances within the transcript where a witness‘[s] testimony was inaudible.‖ However, the motion justice also commented that, in reading the inaudible portions in their context, it was ―apparent that many times one could fill in the blanks with regard to the missing passages in the transcript.‖ He based his denial of the motion upon his review of the transcript and ―the fact that there were exhibits that accompan[ied] the witness[es‘] testimony‖; and, ―given the totality of the information contained in the transcript, as well as the files and the exhibits contained [within it],‖ the motion justice denied the motion to dismiss the indictment against defendant.', 'We are of the opinion that the motion justice was not clearly wrong, nor did his decision fail to do justice between the parties. See Sivo, 809 A.2d at 486. An unintentional recording failure ―shall not affect the validity of the prosecution.‖ See Rule 6(e)(1). Although the grand jury record certainly contains gaps and inaudible words, we agree with the motion justice that defendant was not prejudiced to such an extent as to require dismissal of the indictment—an', '- 15 - ―extreme remedy that is unwarranted except in limited and very rare circumstances.‖', 'See Cassey, 543 A.2d at 676. We are of the opinion that this case falls within the ambit of Rule 6(e)‘s provision that an unintentional failure to record or reproduce the proceedings does not affect the validity of the prosecution.

Kershaw to use her discretion in determining what information to furnish to the state.', 'We have stated that Rule 16 requires that the state, with respect to witnesses it intends to call at trial, turn over any of the witnesses‘ ―prior recorded statements, a summary of their expected trial testimony, and any records of their prior convictions.‖ DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 570 (R.I. 2011). However, we have also noted that ―the state‘s discovery obligations extend beyond the literal language of Rule 16; * * * [w]hen evidence does not fit one of these three categories, but may nonetheless be helpful to defendant‘s effective cross-examination of a witness, a defendant‘s right to that evidence arises from the right of confrontation, and thus becomes an issue only when a defendant is improperly denied the ability to confront and to effectively cross-examine an adverse witness at trial.‖ Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). This obligation, of course, is imposed by the Constitution, and not Rule 16; but we have stated that Rhode Island has ―one of the most liberal discovery mechanisms in the United States.‖ State', '- 16 - v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 163 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). One purpose of Rule 16 is to prevent surprise to either party at trial.

Simpson, 595 A.2d 803, 807 (R.I. 1991). We have also stated that a ―criminal trial is a search for the truth; it is not a game of chess.‖ Oster, 922 A.2d at 163; see also State v. Langstaff, 994 A.2d 1216, 1219 (R.I. 2010) (―This Court has stated that the overarching purpose of Rule 16 is to ensure that criminal trials are fundamentally fair.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)).', 'Accordingly, Rule 16 ―provides the trial justice with a range of sanctions for discovery violations,‖ Gonzalez, 923 A.2d at 1286; the available sanctions include a continuance, a mistrial, or the entry of any other order as is necessary. See Rule 16(i). We have stated that, ―[w]hen determining the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation, the trial justice should look to (1) the reason for [the] nondisclosure, (2) the extent of prejudice to the opposing party, (3) the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and (4) any other relevant factors.‖ State v. Botas, No. 2009-185-C.A., slip op. at 11 (R.I., filed April 23, 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We agree with the trial justice that a violation of Rule 16 occurred in this case—certainly, information regarding the negative ultraviolet light test and regarding Cindy‘s return to the scene of the alleged crime along with her other statements should have been provided to the defense. However, it is equally clear that both the prosecution and the defense were surprised at trial by the new information; we are thus of the view that the record supports the conclusion that the nondisclosures were not deliberate on the part of the prosecutor. The trial justice painstakingly', '- 17 - examined every new piece of evidence that was disclosed in the midst of the trial and heard argument from both parties. In particular, the trial justice determined that the violation could be remedied with a continuance (the duration of which was left to be decided upon by defense counsel) and by giving leave to defense counsel to conduct a ―broad recross-examination‖ of Cindy. The trial justice‘s determination was based in part on the fact that the disclosures occurred during the complaining witness‘s testimony (while she remained on the stand for questioning) and the fact that defense had yet to make an opening statement wherein there might have been a commitment to a particular trial strategy or theory.', 'After careful consideration, we are of the view that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in fashioning the remedy that she selected in connection with the violation at issue. She considered the reason for the nondisclosure (which she determined was not deliberate), the prejudice to defendant (which she determined was not so prejudicial as to warrant a mistrial), and the opportunity for further remedial preparation that a continuance would afford. In our opinion, the relatively early point in the trial when the nondisclosures were revealed and the lack of a commitment by the defense to a particular strategy by way of opening statement were properly taken into account in the trial justice‘s decision not to grant defendant‘s motion to pass the case. Those factors, in combination with the fact that a continuance was offered and liberal recross- examination was permitted, sufficiently addressed any prejudice to defendant. See Botas, slip op. at 12–13. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in refusing to pass the case, and we affirm her decision in that regard.', '- 18 -', 'C', 'The Testimony of Dr. Christine Barron', 'The defendant also asserts that Dr. Barron‘s testimony should have been excluded, in its entirety, because it improperly bolstered the testimony of other fact witnesses. Although the state contends that defendant failed to preserve his argument as to bolstering, we are of the view that it has been properly preserved.', 'It is a fundamental principle that the ―determination of the truthfulness or credibility of a witness lies within the exclusive province of the jury.‖ State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 314 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Testimony of the sort in which ―one witness offer[s] an opinion regarding the truthfulness or accuracy of another witness‘[s] testimony‖ is considered to be impermissible ―bolstering‖ or ―vouching.‖ State v. Arroyo, 844 A.2d 163, 169 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have noted that, ―[o]rdinarily, a witness should not be permitted to offer an opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony of another witness, and his or her testimony will be inadmissible if it literally addresses credibility or has the same substantive import.‖ State v. Lyons, 725 A.2d 271, 276 (R.I. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have further stated that ―[i]mpermissible bolstering may occur even if the witness does not literally state an opinion concerning the credibility of another witness‘s testimony.‖ Arroyo, 844 A.2d at 169 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'At trial, prior to giving her expert opinion, Dr. Barron noted that Cindy‘s grand jury testimony described the presence of red blood; she also noted that the hospital documentation reflected that Cindy reported having experienced vaginal pain. Doctor Barron testified that bright red blood is inconsistent with ―menses,‖ but ―is consistent with acute bleeding.‖ Doctor Barron additionally stated that the witness statement of CNA Cragg and Cindy‘s grand jury', '- 19 - testimony contained information about Cindy‘s vaginal structure, to the effect that ―there was vaginal redness‖ and ―vaginal swelling.‖ Doctor Barron also described the standard of care for performing a sexual assault kit. In the course of her testimony, she was asked to offer her opinion on Dr. Corl‘s performance of the sexual assault kit, and it was her opinion that Dr. Corl‘s performance fell below the standard of care.', 'With respect to the question of penetration, Dr. Barron testified that she had formed an opinion ―based upon [her] training and experience‖ and ―to a reasonable degree of medical certainty concerning [Cindy‘s] diagnosis on the morning of March 18, 2007.‖ Her opinion was that the diagnosis was consistent with ―acute penetrating vaginal trauma.‖ She clarified that ―acute‖ meant ―recent.‖ She based that opinion on her review of the ―documentation of the patient‘s report of vaginal pain, bright red vaginal bleeding and vaginal structure swelling.‖', 'We have noted that, ―[a]lthough our rules of evidence favor testimony that relates percipient observations rather than opinions, there are circumstances when opinion testimony is admissible,‖ such as in the case of an expert witness. Richardson, 47 A.3d at 315. In the present case, defendant stipulated to the qualification of Dr. Barron as an expert in sexual abuse, and her testimony reflected that expertise. In particular, Dr. Barron‘s testimony reflected specialized knowledge about the performance of a sexual assault kit and about whether the evidence that she reviewed was consistent with sexual abuse. See id.', 'Similar to the situation addressed by this Court in Richardson, we must determine whether Dr. Barron‘s testimony, in relying on reports of pain, bleeding, and swelling, ―has the same substantive import as bolstering.‖ See Richardson, 47 A.3d at 315 (internal quotation marks omitted). In our opinion, Dr. Barron‘s testimony did not improperly vouch for or bolster the testimony of other witnesses because it did not address—either directly or indirectly—the', '- 20 - credibility or truthfulness of other fact witnesses.5 See Arroyo, 844 A.2d at 170. Instead, Dr. Barron‘s testimony was in the form of an opinion of the medical diagnosis of Cindy based upon reports and statements regarding her medical condition. See Rule 703 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.6 Her testimony was within the realm of her medical expertise, and it did not rely on Cindy‘s account of what had occurred; instead, her opinion was based upon the medical evidence, which included specific complaints of vaginal pain and descriptions of blood and swelling. The jury was free to accept or reject that testimony, which was subject to vigorous cross-examination.', 'We are of the view that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in permitting Dr. Barron‘s testimony or in revealing the bases of her opinion. Because the decision about the admissibility of such testimony is confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and because we do not believe that Dr. Barron‘s testimony constituted impermissible vouching or bolstering, we affirm the trial justice‘s ruling with respect to Dr. Barron‘s testimony. 5', 'We have duly considered defendant‘s assertion that his case presents a situation akin to the issue addressed by this Court in State v. Castore, 435 A.2d 321 (R.I. 1981). That case, however, is easily distinguishable. In Castore, the expert‘s opinion ―was based, not upon his examination of [the complaining witness] or upon laboratory tests, but solely on what she had related to him about what went on within the walls of the * * * home.‖ Id. at 326. By contrast, Dr. Barron‘s opinion was based upon reports and objective medical evidence such as complaints of pain and bleeding, and not on the complaining witness‘s account of the sexual assault.

9,State : v. : John J. Eddy.,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Is a trial justice constitutionally required to appoint counsel to represent a pro se defendant who voluntarily absents himself from trial? We hold that neither the United States Constitution, nor article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution mandates that counsel be appointed in such a situation. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction for three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1, 1 and two counts of first-degree sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-2. 2 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.1 provides that “[a] person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under. 2', 'Section 11-37-2 provides, in pertinent part, that “[a] person is guilty of first degree sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with another person, and if any of the following circumstances exist: * * * (2) The accused uses force or coercion.”', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Appointment and Discharge of Defendant’s Attorneys', 'On April 21, 2004, defendant John J. Eddy was indicted on three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and two counts of first-degree sexual assault. On September 13, 2004, an attorney in the Office of the Public Defender entered his appearance on behalf of defendant. On December 16, 2004, defendant filed a motion to discharge that attorney and indicated that he wished to represent himself. On that same day, the motion justice 3 allowed defendant’s attorney to withdraw, and she appointed a private attorney (defendant’s second attorney) as standby counsel. 4', 'On February 17, 2005, the trial justice was assigned to defendant’s case.', 'At the beginning of a hearing on that date, the trial justice addressed defendant’s decision to act in a pro se capacity. An exchange between defendant and the trial justice proceeded as follows:', '“THE COURT: * * * You have an absolute right, as far as I’m', 'concerned, to represent yourself. You appear to be competent. * *', '* Our law is clear, if you wish to represent yourself, you may do', 'so. I would just say to you, you’re undertaking a very perilous task', 'in representing yourself. I was looking at the five counts that have', 'been lodged against you by way of indictment. If you’re convicted', 'of any one of these counts, you face the responsibility of a rather', 'long jail sentence. Are you aware of that?', '“MR. EDDY: Yes, your Honor, I am. 3', 'We will refer to the Superior Court justice who heard the preliminary motions in this case as the motion justice, and we will refer to the justice who presided over the later motions and the trial as the trial justice. 4', 'The proceedings that occurred on December 16, 2005 are unclear from the record, because defendant has not provided us with a transcript from that day. However, it is clear from defendant’s written motion that he vehemently requested that the court discharge his attorney from the Office of the Public Defender, and that private counsel was then appointed on a standby basis.', '-2-', '“THE COURT: All right. And is it your request today to', 'represent yourself?', '“MR. EDDY: Yes, your Honor.', '“THE COURT: It’s your wish to do so for all aspects of this', 'case?', '“MR. EDDY: It is, your Honor.', '“THE COURT: All right. I’m going to grant his motion to', 'represent himself. * * * I am going to require you to have the', 'assistance of [defendant’s second attorney] as standby counsel.” However, when defendant’s second attorney informed the trial justice that defendant had filed a disciplinary complaint against him, and that defendant had expressed his intent to press that complaint with Disciplinary Counsel, the trial justice released defendant’s second attorney from the case. The trial justice explained to defendant that if he continued in the case pro se, then the trial justice was going to hold him to “the exact same standard as any attorney” and that he would “get no greater or lesser consideration because [he was] representing [him]self.” The defendant indicated to the trial justice that he understood. The trial justice then reminded defendant:', '“You have a very difficult row to hoe[.] * * * You’re entitled to', 'have an attorney represent you. I’m happy to appoint one for you.', '* * * [But] I’m not going to * * * give you any special', 'consideration because of the difficulty that you seem to have', 'placed yourself in [by choosing to represent yourself].”', 'On April 28, 2005, the trial justice conducted a bail hearing, during which the complaining witness testified. Midway through the complaining witness’s testimony, defendant requested the appointment of still another attorney. The state objected, declaring that that request was merely a delay tactic. After hearing the state’s objection, the trial justice addressed defendant:', '“THE COURT: You already fired two attorneys. What is this', 'great epiphany now? * * * [W]hy [do] you suddenly have this', 'innovation now that you think you need a lawyer after protesting', 'on this record, in a rather forceful manner, that you didn’t have any', '-3-', 'trust with attorneys, you didn’t trust them, you didn’t want to be', 'represented by an attorney and you felt you could adequately', 'represent yourself[?]', '“MR. EDDY: I did make the statement that I had a lack of trust', 'with attornies [sic]. I can say why. My record will prove I have', 'been represented numerous times.', '“THE COURT: So what happens when we appoint another', 'attorney for you and you’re dissatisfied with that attorney, and you', 'fire that attorney? Do you think that the tail is going to wag this', 'dog?', '“MR. EDDY: No. I believed up front I can handle this. I can', 'see now that I’m drowning. I’m over my head here. I can’t handle', 'this.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT: You had every opportunity. You had two', 'attorneys already. You know you’re not the first person that has', 'been here trying to play the court system like a violin. How many', 'lawyers do you think you’re going to get here? You can’t afford', 'an attorney, can you?', '“MR. EDDY: No, sir.', '“THE COURT: You’re entitled to have an attorney represent', 'you that is a competent attorney[,] not to have that attorney do', 'what you think ought to be done because you’re not a lawyer, but', 'to competently represent you in these proceedings. You have', 'already discharged two people, well known to this court, who are', 'excellent and well qualified to represent you in this case.', '“Now, what makes you think that we’re going to appoint a third', 'attorney for you so that when it becomes convenient for you, you', 'can simply dismiss that attorney because of some alleged', 'disagreement or inability to communicate?” The trial justice then ruled on defendant’s request. He said:', '“The Court is going to rule that you have affirmatively waived', 'your right to an attorney for the purposes of a bail hearing that has', 'been set down for today’s hearing.', '“This matter has been pending for over two [years]. You were', 'given adequate notice to prepare for this hearing. It was extended', 'specifically from your own request to this later date. * * * [F]rom', 'my reading of the record and from my reading of this file, all of the', 'attempts to provide you with prior counsel, to provide you with a', 'bail hearing to which you are entitled within ten days of your arrest', 'have been thwarted by you and you alone and because you have', 'waived your right to an attorney for the purposes of this bail', 'hearing and have during the bail hearing made a plea for an', 'attorney, I will appoint an attorney to you but not for the purposes', '-4-', 'of this hearing for which you have clearly and irrevocably waived', 'your right.', '“There has to be some reasonable rules of procedure in dealing', 'with a serious case like this.

However, in a letter dated August 3, 2005, defendant once again requested that the third attorney be “completely removed” from his case, and a formal motion to release was filed on August 17, 2005. Two days later, on August 19, 2005, the trial justice held a hearing on defendant’s motion to release the third attorney. The following exchange took place:', '“THE COURT: All right. Well, our case law is rather clear,', 'Mr. Eddy has a right to discharge his lawyer at any time, for any', 'reason, and he has the right to represent himself.', '“* * *', '“At the bail hearing * * * the Court appointed [defendant’s third', 'attorney] who has been before this bar for over 30 years.

He has extensive experience in capital cases', 'of all types including the matter before the court of the allegations', 'of child molestation.', '“From all accounts and appearances, he had been more than', 'diligent in representing the interests of Mr. Eddy but, as I', 'indicated, the case law is clear, Mr. Eddy may discharge his', 'attorney for cause or no cause any time he wishes. That, however,', 'will not delay these proceedings.', '“As I told Mr. Eddy when this case was assigned back in the', 'spring, this matter is going to proceed in an orderly manner.', '“You will represent yourself, but I have some authority in this', 'case, Mr. Eddy, and I will ask [defendant’s third attorney] if he is', 'willing to stay on as standby counsel in this matter. Are you', 'willing to do that?”', '-5-', '“[DEFENDANT’S THIRD ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor,', 'definitely.”', 'The trial justice then addressed defendant in order to, once again, ensure that he fully understood what he was undertaking by representing himself. The colloquy occurred as follows:', '“THE COURT: Well, do you understand what you’re taking', 'on[?]', '“THE DEFENDANT: I believe I do, Your Honor.', '“THE COURT: All right. You’re going to be required to', 'impanel a jury. You’re going to be required to examine and cross-', 'examine witnesses if you wish. As I indicated to you before, you', 'will not receive any special consideration from this court because', 'you’re undertaking this task which I think is rather daunting for', 'someone who does not have legal training.', '“I will state, for the record, that I think you have above-average', 'intelligence which, of course, is my observation but which is at', 'least a benefit to you, but you’re undertaking a task here which is', 'extremely difficult. There is a lot at stake here.', '“You’re charged with five capital offenses. A conviction of any', 'one of which has a maximum penalty of life in prison.', '“Now, I’m sure you have given significant reflection on this in', 'your various writings that you’ve made to the Court and your', 'various motions so if you wish to represent yourself, you may do', 'so. Is that your desire here today?', '“THE DEFENDANT: It is, Your Honor.', '“THE COURT: All right. Then you will represent yourself.', '“* * * The matter is going to be set down for trial in a matter of', 'two or three weeks and [defendant’s third attorney] will be there', 'for your assistance if you wish. You don’t need to consult him, but', 'if you wish to consult him, he will be willing and able to assist', 'you. I wish you well in this endeavor, but you’re undertaking a', 'very, very difficult task.”', 'On September 27, 2005, defendant again expressed his desire to completely remove his third attorney from the case and conveyed that he no longer wished that he remain as standby counsel.', 'Again, the trial justice rendered a lengthy recitation of defendant’s history of requesting—and then firing—attorneys. After doing so, the trial justice insisted that defendant’s third attorney remain on the case on a standby basis. In response, defendant again requested that he be permitted to go forward in the case alone, stating:', '-6-', '“I want the court record to reflect that while I know that I’m', 'entitled to counsel, I’m also entitled to represent myself. Part of', 'that Sixth Amendment right is the right to competent counsel, and I', 'don’t feel that [defendant’s third attorney] is competent. I', 'presently have a complaint questioning his competency pending', 'before the disciplinary counsel.” The trial justice again informed defendant that the trial justice had made a determination that defendant’s third attorney was competent and that he would remain on the case as standby counsel.', 'The defendant then objected to “an attorney” whom defendant believed to be incompetent “being forced upon [him].” In response, the trial justice asked:', '“THE COURT: Do you want me to excuse him as standby', 'counsel?', '“THE DEFENDANT: I certainly do.', '“THE COURT: I will excuse him, on the record, from standby', 'counsel. You will not get another standby counsel appointed to', 'assist you. You will not have any other counsel appointed. You', 'will represent yourself. Proceed.', '“THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, Your Honor.”', 'Almost four months later, on January 18, 2006, the trial justice heard defendant’s motion for a continuance.', 'Although it had already been twenty-one months since defendant was indicted, the trial justice nonetheless granted a continuance for over one month “to try to allow [defendant] the farthest reach of due process and elemental fairness that [he could] without abusing the system.”', 'B', 'Trial and Sentencing', 'On February 22, 2006, the matter finally proceeded to trial.', 'The trial justice first provided defendant with an extensive blueprint of how the trial would proceed, immediately before jury selection was to begin. At that point, defendant again inquired about whether he could have counsel appointed to represent him. The trial justice informed defendant that he had', '-7- had “ample opportunity” to be represented by appointed counsel, and he declined to appoint another attorney on the very morning that the trial was to commence.', 'It is significant that, before jury selection began, the trial justice instructed the jury pool that defendant had opted to exercise his constitutional right to represent himself, but that that fact “should not engender any sympathy for him[,] * * * nor should it engender any prejudice or bias.” The parties then commenced jury selection, and the jury was sworn.', 'The next morning, defendant again requested the appointment of counsel for the purpose of assisting him in plea negotiations. The trial justice responded:', '“All right. Mr. Eddy, the jury has been sworn. That means', 'jeopardy has now attached. We have to go forward with this trial', 'at this time. You have steadfastly resisted all attempts by this', 'Court to afford you competent reasonable legal assistance.', '“Now, if you wish to have a brief period of time to discuss with', 'the prosecution whether or not it is possible for you to enter a plea', 'today, I will allow some reasonable time for that to take place.', 'But, I’m not going to appoint an attorney for you for that process.', 'You had ample opportunity to do that.” At that point, defendant expressed his desire to absent himself from the trial in the event a plea agreement was not reached. Specifically, he said, “I don’t want to be in the courtroom so the trial may proceed in my absence * * *. I ask that I be allowed to be removed from the courtroom during this process because I don’t want to cause a situation of forced removal.”', 'The parties discussed a possible resolution of the case by plea for almost an hour, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The trial justice then addressed defendant’s expressed desire to absent himself from the trial proceedings. The following exchange occurred:', '“THE COURT: All right. Now, when we recessed at 10:00', 'you indicated to me that you voluntarily wanted to absent yourself', 'in this trial. That, if I did not [accede] to your desire you would do', 'something which I would assume to be something to be inordinate', 'behavior that would cause you to be removed from this forum. Is', 'that correct?', '-8-', '“MR. EDDY: Yes, your Honor.', '“THE COURT: Is it your true desire not to participate in this', 'trial in any way whatsoever?', '“MR.

Do you understand that?', '“MR. EDDY: [The prosecutor] explained.', '“THE COURT: That means this case has to go forward or be', 'disposed of by a plea by you or go forward to a verdict by this jury.', 'You have a constitutional right to be present[] at this trial. Are you', 'aware of that?', '“MR. EDDY: Yes.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT: * * * You are not giving up the right to trial', 'but by voluntarily absenting yourself and not being represented by', 'any other counsel you are giving up your right to confront and', 'cross[-]examine the State’s witness which is a very important Sixth', 'Amendment right that you have.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT: * * * I have no intention of keeping you here', 'against your will * * *.

You are giving up your right to testify personally and', 'also present witnesses on your behalf. Do you understand that?” The defendant then said that he felt his right to call witnesses had already been taken away from him, but that he understood the rest of the trial justice’s recitation of his rights. The trial justice explained that defendant’s right to call witnesses had not in any way been impaired, and he then asked defendant, “Are you asking me to do this knowingly, willingly and voluntarily?” The', '-9- defendant responded, “I am, your Honor,” and then he informed the trial justice that he did not desire to be present for the reading of the verdict at the conclusion of the trial. The defendant was then escorted from the courtroom, and the jury was brought in.', 'Significantly, the trial justice explained to the jury that defendant’s voluntary absence from trial “in no way [affected] the rights that he ha[d] as a defendant,” including “[t]he presumption of innocence.” He then instructed the jury that it “must not in any way prejudice Mr. Eddy for his own desire to be absent from this proceeding.”', 'The trial continued in defendant’s absence, and the state presented its case. 5 On several occasions during the course of the trial, the trial justice inquired as to whether defendant had any desire to resume participation in the proceedings. The defendant declined the trial justice’s invitation to participate each time. After the state’s closing argument, the trial justice instructed the jury. In addition to the instructions that are customarily given in a criminal case, the trial justice also instructed the jury that defendant’s absence from trial “should have no bearing whatsoever on * * * [his] presumption of innocence,” and that the jury was “not to take [his absence] as any indication of guilt.” He informed the jury of defendant’s privilege against self- incrimination, and he instructed that no inferences of guilt could be drawn from defendant’s decisions not to testify or offer any evidence.', 'On February 24, 2006, the jury found defendant guilty of all five counts, and a judgment of conviction was entered. 6 The trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment on each of the first three counts, to run concurrently, and life imprisonment for each of the last two counts, 5', 'After the state presented its case, the trial justice declared that, had a motion for judgment of acquittal been made by defendant under Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the evidence presented by the state was sufficient to sustain a conviction on all counts. Therefore, the trial justice ruled that he would have denied a Rule 29 motion if defendant had, in fact, made such a motion. 6', 'No motion for a new trial was filed in this case.', '- 10 - to run concurrently with each other, but to run consecutively to the life sentences imposed for the first three counts. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. 7', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that, “when confronted with questions of law on appeal, this Court undertakes a de novo review.” State v. Lopez-Navor, 951 A.2d 508, 510-11 (R.I. 2008). Likewise, we review “alleged violations of constitutional rights” de novo. State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1049 (R.I. 2004). However, “[e]ven when the de novo standard is applied to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference in conducting our review.” Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 316 (R.I. 2008).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that: (1) the waiver of his right to counsel at trial was not voluntary; (2) even if his waiver was voluntary, he later revoked that waiver; (3) the trial justice was constitutionally required to appoint counsel—at least on a standby basis—to represent defendant after he chose to proceed pro se and then absented himself from the trial; (4) the trial justice should not have permitted defendant to absent himself from the trial under Rule 43 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, because he was charged with “the Rhode Island equivalent of a capital crime”; (5) his conviction should be overturned because he was tried in Providence County on a criminal offense that allegedly occurred in Kent County, which defendant alleges was an improper venue; and (6) the cumulative effect of all the purported 7', 'The defendant appeared pro se before this Court.', '- 11 - errors requires that his conviction be overturned. We shall address each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Waiver of Right to Counsel', 'The defendant argues that he did not voluntarily waive his right to counsel, and, as a result, he should be afforded a new trial. The defendant attempts to demonstrate that his waiver was involuntary by distinguishing the facts in his case from those in State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016 (R.I. 2002), in which this Court held that Thornton validly waived his right to counsel. 8', '“The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution provide that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused enjoys the right to the assistance of counsel.” State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 252 (R.I. 2004). However, these constitutional provisions “also allow[] a defendant in a criminal trial to represent himself, provided that his waiver of counsel is valid.” Id. (citing State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 2001); see also Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819 (1975) (“The Sixth Amendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right to make his defense.”). 8', 'In State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1022 (R.I. 2002), the defendant rejected the representation of three court-appointed attorneys, but standby counsel was appointed to assist him. Prior to trial, the defendant indicated that he would accept his standby counsel as his attorney, but on the condition that he receive a continuance of at least ninety days. Id. at 1024. The trial justice refused to continue the trial any further, so the defendant elected to proceed pro se with the assistance of his standby counsel, whom the defendant relied on during the trial. Id. at 1024-25. After being convicted, the defendant conceded, before this Court, that his waiver of counsel was voluntary, but he argued that his waiver “was not made knowingly and intelligently.” Id. at 1022. This Court affirmed his conviction, holding that his waiver was knowing and intelligent. Id. at 1027, 1045.', '- 12 -', 'It is well settled that “[t]his Court employs a two-prong analysis to review the validity of a defendant’s waiver of counsel: first, we must determine whether the waiver was ‘voluntary’; then, we must determine whether it was ‘knowing and intelligent.’” State v. Brumfield, 900 A.2d 1151, 1153 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253). “When considering the validity of the waiver, we examine the totality of the circumstances.” Id. (quoting Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253).', 'In Laurence—a case that bears a striking resemblance to the matter that is before us—we held that a “defendant’s ‘repeated refusal to accept the services of competent court-appointed defense counsel demonstrates clearly the voluntary waiver of his right to counsel * * *.’” Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253 (quoting Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1026). Laurence was offered the “services of three court-appointed attorneys and one standby counsel, all of whom” he dismissed, despite continued efforts by the trial justice to convince him to accept their representation. Id. at 254, 255. Additionally, Laurence “asserted many times at trial that it was not his desire to represent himself and that he felt coerced into doing so * * *.” Id. at 254. Nonetheless, this Court held that “defendant’s actions, rather than his words, demonstrate[d] that he waived his right to counsel,” id. at 254, and “his continued rejection of competent representation [wa]s the equivalent to a voluntary waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.” Id. at 255. Moreover, this Court held that “he was not in any way unconstitutionally forced to proceed pro se.” Id. at 253 (quoting Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1026).', 'We believe that the facts of Laurence are remarkably similar to the matter that is before us. The defendant in this case was provided with three competent attorneys to represent him, and each time he vehemently insisted that each be removed from his case.', 'However, unlike Laurence, the defendant in this case repeatedly and forcefully requested that he be allowed to', '- 13 - represent himself. Furthermore, the trial justice continually reminded defendant of the perils of proceeding without an attorney—at least on a standby basis—yet defendant insisted on discharging all of his appointed attorneys. After defendant objected to having his third appointed attorney remain on the case as standby counsel, the trial justice asked defendant:', '“THE COURT: Do you want me to excuse him as standby', 'counsel?', '“THE DEFENDANT: I certainly do.', '“THE COURT: I will excuse him, on the record, from standby', 'counsel. You will not get another standby counsel appointed to', 'assist you. You will not have any other counsel appointed. You', 'will represent yourself. Proceed.', '“THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, Your Honor.” Finally, the trial justice indicated that he believed that defendant’s motive for repeatedly requesting and firing attorneys was to delay the proceedings. He told defendant, “all of the attempts to provide you with prior counsel, to provide you with a bail hearing to which you are entitled within ten days of your arrest have been thwarted by you and you alone. * * * This matter has been pending for over two years now * * * through nobody’s efforts but your own.”', 'Based on the totality of the circumstances, we are confident that defendant’s waiver of his right to counsel was voluntary. Both his actions and his words demonstrate that his waiver was the product of his own free will. Despite defendant’s purported grievances with the manner in which his appointed attorneys conducted his defense, it is well settled that “[t]he Sixth Amendment provides no right to counsel ‘who would blindly follow [a defendant’s] instructions.’” Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1029 n.14 (quoting McQueen v. Blackburn, 755 F.2d 1174, 1178 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 852 (1985)). “Nor is there any ‘absolute right to counsel of one’s choice.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Peister, 631 F.2d 658, 661 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1126 (1981)). As was the case in Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254-55, “[i]t seems', '- 14 - obvious that defendant was not willing to work with any counsel in any capacity. This was no fault of the judiciary, which bent over backwards to attain representation for him.” 9', 'In his brief, defendant attempts to distinguish the facts of his case from those of Thornton. However, in Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1026, the defendant conceded that his waiver was voluntary, and thus, the voluntariness of his waiver was not an issue that was before this Court. Id. at 1026. Instead, the salient issue in that case was whether Thornton’s waiver was “knowing and intelligent,” such that it satisfied the second prong of the waiver-of-counsel analysis. Id. Because defendant asserts only that his waiver was not voluntary, and he does not argue that it was not knowing and intelligent, defendant’s reliance on Thornton is not persuasive. 10 Accordingly, we hold that defendant validly waived his right to counsel.', 'B', 'Revocation of Waiver', 'Next, defendant argues that, even if he had previously waived his right to counsel, he later revoked that waiver at trial. Specifically, he contends that the trial justice erred by not making any specific findings as to defendant’s intent behind his request for counsel at trial and, further, that he erred by declining to appoint counsel for defendant after he revoked any waiver that he may have made previously. The state counters by arguing that once a defendant waives his right to counsel, the trial justice has discretion in determining whether counsel should be 9', 'We observe that defendant has also fired more than one attorney appointed to represent him on this appeal. 10', 'Nonetheless, after a thorough review of the record, it is abundantly clear to us that defendant’s waiver was knowing and intelligent, based on the numerous detailed colloquies between him and the trial justice, as well as the trial justice’s finding that defendant had “above-average intelligence.” See State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 2001) (“[T]he simplest method to determine whether a waiver of counsel is knowing or voluntary may be a detailed colloquy between the trial court and the defendant, [however] such an inquiry is not constitutionally required.” citing Lopez v. Thompson, 202 F.3d 1110, 1117 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 883 (2000)).', '- 15 - appointed and that the trial justice in this case was well within his discretion to deny defendant’s request at such a late stage in the proceedings. We agree with the state.', 'When a defendant seeks the appointment of counsel after he or she already has waived that right, a trial justice has more latitude in determining whether to provide the defendant with representation. See United States v. Leveto, 540 F.3d 200, 207 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 906 (2009); United States v. Solina, 733 F.2d 1208, 1211-12 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1039 (1984). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit described this principle as follows:', '“[W]e find wide agreement that, once waived, the Sixth', 'Amendment right to counsel is no longer absolute. * * * We', 'reaffirm that questions arising from a defendant’s Sixth', 'Amendment absolute right to professional legal counsel receive', 'plenary review. * * * Yet, once the right has been properly waived,', 'as is the case here, we are persuaded by the broad consensus of', 'other courts that the consideration of a defendant’s post-waiver', 'request for counsel is well within the discretion of the district', 'court.', '“Moreover, while we have a strong interest in safeguarding a', 'defendant’s access to professional legal representation * * * other', 'factors necessarily play an important role in a district court’s', 'deliberation of a post-waiver request for counsel. Certainly,', 'evidence of a defendant’s dilatory motive is properly considered as', 'a basis for denial. Moreover, particularly as the trial date draws', 'nearer, the district court can and should consider the practical', 'concerns of managing its docket and the impact that a request may', 'have on its general responsibilities for the prudent administration', 'of justice.” Leveto, 540 F.3d at 207. Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has held that', '“[a] criminal defendant has a constitutional right to defend himself;', 'and with rights come responsibilities. If at the last minute he gets', 'cold feet and wants a lawyer to defend him he runs the risk that the', 'judge will hold him to his original decision in order to avoid the', 'disruption of the court’s schedule that a continuance granted on the', 'very day that trial is scheduled to begin is bound to cause.” Solina,', '733 F.2d at 1211-12.', '- 16 - Other courts have agreed. See United States v. Merchant, 992 F.2d 1091, 1095 (10th Cir. 1993); Menefield v. Borg, 881 F.2d 696, 700 (9th Cir. 1989).', 'In this case, on the very morning that the trial was to begin, defendant asked the trial justice what his position would be “should defendant request assignment of counsel.” The trial justice responded that he “would deny it if the State [object]ed,” reasoning that the state and the complaining witness had the right to move forward and adjudicate the matter. The trial justice then told defendant that he had “had ample opportunity on every occasion to make that request” but that the trial justice was not going to appoint counsel on the day the trial was to begin.', 'Then, after the jury was empaneled and sworn, defendant explicitly requested that counsel be appointed for the purpose of “the possibility of plea negotiations” with the state. The trial justice informed defendant that jeopardy had attached and that the trial needed to move forward. The trial justice reiterated that defendant “had ample opportunity to” enter into plea negotiation and had “steadfastly resisted all attempts by th[e] Court to afford [him] competent reasonable legal assistance.”', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred by not making an explicit determination as to whether defendant’s post-waiver request for counsel was made in bad faith for the purpose of delay or disruption; however, it is our opinion that the trial justice’s determinations were sufficient. As the Third Circuit has said:', '“The significance of representation by professional legal', 'counsel demands that any decision that touches upon the', 'availability of counsel must be investigated and explained on the', 'record. Yet, we do not insist upon a formal inquiry or colloquy', 'where the rationales for the request and decision are clearly', 'apparent on the record.” Leveto, 540 F.3d at 208.', 'Given defendant’s colorful history of requesting representation, then stridently demanding that his attorneys be discharged, there is ample evidence to support the trial justice’s', '- 17 - conclusion that defendant had attempted to delay the proceedings at every stage of this case. As in Leveto, 540 F.3d at 208, “[i]mmediately before [defendant]’s morning-of-trial request for counsel,” the trial justice in this case found that defendant had consistently attempted to delay his trial. The trial justice explained:', '“[T]his trial has been continued six or seven times at the request of', 'the defendant. He has been allowed to do whatever he wished to', 'do with regard to the filing of various motions. The State has filed', 'for discovery from him and has not received it. The State has done', 'everything reasonably possible to allow Mr. Eddy the latitude to', 'prepare himself for this case and the Court, I think, has bent over', 'backwards in its efforts to afford a reasonable time frame for Mr.', 'Eddy to prepare himself also. So, for those reasons the Court is', 'not going to continue this matter any further.” Additionally, at an earlier stage of the proceedings, the trial justice found that “all of the attempts to provide [defendant] with prior counsel, to provide [him] with a bail hearing * * * have been thwarted by [defendant] alone.” Furthermore, the trial justice said that “[t]his matter has been pending for over two years now * * * through nobody’s efforts but [defendant’s] own.” Thus, there is ample evidence on the record to demonstrate that defendant’s dilatory tactics were at least one factor that the trial justice looked to when denying defendant’s request. See Leveto, 540 F.3d at 207 (“Certainly, evidence of a defendant’s dilatory motive is properly considered as a basis for denial [of a post-waiver request for counsel].”).', 'Furthermore, defendant made this request for counsel after the trial had already commenced and the jury had been empaneled and sworn. Thus, jeopardy had already attached. State v. Francis, 719 A.2d 858, 859 (R.I. 1998) (“In a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.”). Indeed, the trial justice explicitly made that finding after defendant’s request for counsel when he said: “Mr. Eddy, the jury has been sworn. That means jeopardy has now attached. We have to go forward with this trial at this time.” Thus, defendant’s request for', '- 18 - the appointment of a fourth attorney was at an extremely late stage of the game and would have caused even further delay. See Leveto, 540 F.3d at 207 (“[P]articularly as the trial date draws nearer, the [trial] court can and should consider the practical concerns of managing its docket and the impact that a request may have on its general responsibilities for the prudent administration of justice.”).', 'Moreover, defendant explicitly stated that his reason for requesting another attorney was for the “possibility of plea negotiations” with the state. Consequently, the appointment of a fourth attorney would have been only for a narrow and limited purpose. 11 However, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held, “[a] defendant is not entitled to ‘choreograph special appearances by counsel,’ * * * or repeatedly to alternate his position on counsel in order to delay his trial or otherwise obstruct the orderly administration of justice.” United States v. Taylor, 933 F.2d 307, 311 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 883 (1991) (quoting McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 183 (1984)).', 'Accordingly, “the rationales for the [defendant’s] request and [the trial justice’s] decision are clearly apparent on the record,” and, therefore, “a formal inquiry or colloquy” was not necessary. Leveto, 540 F.3d at 208.', 'Furthermore, given defendant’s history of causing inordinate delay and his distrust of attorneys—and in the interests of judicial economy and the orderly administration of justice—we conclude that the trial justice was well within his discretion to deny defendant’s eleventh-hour, post-waiver request for counsel. 11', 'We note that plea negotiations are a critical stage of criminal proceedings, at which a defendant enjoys the right to counsel, unless that right is waived. Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1406 (2012).', '- 19 -', 'C', 'Defendant’s Voluntarily Absence from Trial', 'Next, defendant argues that the trial justice was constitutionally required to appoint counsel—at least on a standby basis—to represent him after he absented himself from trial. Specifically, he argues that his lack of representation was “inimical to [his] rights to counsel, and due process of law” contained in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'As a first consideration, it is well settled that a defendant may waive his right to counsel. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835 (holding that a defendant may “relinquish[] * * * the right to counsel” if he does so “knowingly and intelligently”). Additionally, it is well established that a defendant may waive his right to be present at trial. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 342-43 (1970) (holding that the right to be present at trial “may be lost by consent or at times even by misconduct,” quoting Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106 (1934)). However, the salient issue that is before this Court is whether the United States or Rhode Island Constitutions permit a defendant to waive both rights. We answer that question in the affirmative.', 'After defendant requested to absent himself from trial, the trial justice cautiously engaged in an extensive colloquy with defendant. The trial justice instructed him of all the rights that he was giving up by not being present at trial, and defendant indicated that he was insisting that he absent himself “knowingly, willingly and voluntarily.”', 'Therefore, it is clear to us that defendant’s waiver of his right to be present at trial was made of his own free will. Indeed, defendant does not contend that his decision to absent himself was not voluntary. The fact that defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial is a critical factor in our analysis,', '- 20 - because courts that have addressed the issue that is before us have distinguished between defendants’ voluntary and involuntary absences.', 'In United States v. Mack, 362 F.3d 597, 600-03 (9th Cir. 2004), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the issue of whether a defendant must be appointed representation after he is involuntarily removed from the courtroom. The defendant in that case dismissed three attorneys before electing to represent himself. Id. at 599. He refused to have standby counsel appointed unless he could choose a person who was not on the court’s standard appointment list; consequently, “standby counsel was not appointed.” Id. At trial, the defendant acted in an “obstreperous, contemptuous,” and threatening manner, and, as a result, he “was taken from the courtroom, questioning of witnesses ceased, and [he] was precluded from presenting closing argument to the jury.” Id. After he was convicted, the defendant appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction. Mack, 362 F.3d at 599, 603. The court held that a', '“trial judge may terminate self-representation by a defendant who', 'deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct. Of', 'course, a State may—even over objection by the accused—appoint', 'a ‘standby counsel’ to aid the accused if and when the accused', 'requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the', 'event that termination of the defendant’s self-representation is', 'necessary.” Id. at 601 (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834-35 n.46). The court then explained that “[a] defendant does not forfeit his right to representation at trial when he acts out. He merely forfeits his right to represent himself in the proceeding.” Id. at 601. The court further observed that, “[i]n practical effect, he had been removed as his own counsel and nobody stepped in to fill the gap. While we do understand that the district court had to do something about [the defendant’s] obnoxious behavior, effectively leaving him without representation was still far from appropriate.” Id.', '- 21 -', 'Likewise in Davis v. Grant, 532 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1176 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit indicated that appointment of counsel might be required during a pro se defendant’s involuntary absence from trial. In Davis, 532 F.3d at 137, the defendant was involuntarily removed from the courtroom after a series of outbursts, and his standby counsel or “legal advisor” was directed “to leave the defense table and to sit in the first row of the public seating area.” In the defendant’s absence, three of the state’s witnesses testified, none of whom were subjected to cross-examination. Id. The defendant then rejoined the trial and participated in the proceeding to its conclusion. Id. After his conviction in state court was affirmed, the defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, alleging “that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when he was removed from the courtroom during prosecution witness testimony with no standby counsel appointed to represent him in his absence.” Id. at 138. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the defendant’s petition. Id. at 139.', 'On appeal from that dismissal, the Second Circuit—constrained by the limited scope of habeas review—affirmed, holding that “we cannot conclude that the state court decisions were unreasonable applications of [United States] Supreme Court precedent * * *.” Davis, 532 F.3d at 140. Nevertheless, the court went on to observe that, had it been considering the issue de novo, it “might * * * conclude that the trial court was constitutionally required to appoint standby counsel for [the defendant] during his involuntary absence from the courtroom * * *.” Id. at 139- 40. Several other courts have also reached this conclusion. See, e.g., People v. Carroll, 189 Cal.Rptr. 327, 331 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983); Jones v. State, 449 So.2d 253, 257 (Fla. 1984); Saunders v. State, 721 S.W.2d 359, 363 (Tex. Ct. App. 1986).', '- 22 -', 'On the other hand, when a pro se defendant absents himself from his trial of his own volition, courts are almost uniform in holding that a trial judge is not constitutionally required to appoint counsel to represent the absent defendant. In Clark v. Perez, 510 F.3d 382 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 823 (2008), the defendant, elected to represent herself and, “in an act of political protest, [she] and her co-defendants absented themselves from the courtroom through nearly all of the pre-trial proceedings and the trial itself, listening to the proceedings through a speaker in their holding cells.” Id. at 385. Although the defendant had legal advisors, “the defense table was empty throughout the prosecution’s case and no objections were interposed by the defense.” Id. at 387.', 'More than two decades after she was convicted, the defendant successfully petitioned for habeas relief in federal district court. Id. at 388-89. “The district court held that the state trial court violated [the defendant’s] Sixth Amendment rights * * * by allowing the trial to continue without revoking [the defendant’s] pro se status (or appointing standby counsel) after [the defendant] refused to participate in or attend her trial.” Id. at 396. The state appealed from the district court’s decision to grant the defendant’s habeas petition. Id. at 385.', 'In its de novo review, a unanimous panel of the Second Circuit reversed. Clark, 510 F.3d at 389-90, 397.', 'The court began its analysis by noting that, because “[t]he right to self- representation may tend to run at cross-purposes to the right to effective assistance of counsel,” the court would “exercise caution when called upon to establish per se rules that might overprotect either of these rights.” Id. at 395. The court held that “there was no constitutional violation because [the defendant] knowingly and intelligently waived her right to counsel, unequivocally asserted her right to self-representation, made a conscious strategic choice to waive her right to be present in the courtroom as part of a de facto political protest defense, and', '- 23 - was afforded the opportunity to return whenever she chose.” Id. at 396. The court stressed “the sanctity of freedom of choice,” id. at 397 (quoting Torres v. United States, 140 F.3d 392, 402 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1042 (1998)), from which the right to self-representation stems:', '“[The defendant] complains that the judge conducted the trial in a', 'manner that violated her constitutional rights. It was, however, her', 'choice to conduct her trial in that manner, and she made the choice', 'in part to achieve what she perceived as tactical advantages,', 'rejecting the trial judge’s warnings of the risks involved. If she', 'faced trial without advantages guaranteed by the Sixth', 'Amendment, that was not by the trial judge’s imposition, but by', 'her own informed choice, which the trial judge was bound to', 'respect. Her claim of violation of her constitutional rights has no', 'merit whatsoever.” Clark, 510 F.3d at 397.', 'Other courts that have addressed this issue have agreed. See, e.g., Torres, 140 F.3d at 401, 402, 403 (finding no error when the trial court failed to appoint an attorney to represent a pro se defendant who had voluntarily absented herself from the proceedings in order to conduct a political protest defense because “the district court properly respected [the defendant’s] decision and her right to choose that course”); People v. Parento, 1 Cal.Rptr.2d 444, 446 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991) (holding that “a defendant who has exercised his right of self-representation by absenting himself from the proceedings, may not later claim error resulting from that exercise”); People v. Brante, 232 P.3d 204, 208-09 (Colo. App. 2009) (“[T]he trial court did not violate the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by declining sua sponte to appoint advisory counsel to take over the defense in his [voluntary] absence.”); State v. Worthy, 583 N.W.2d 270, 279 (Minn. 1998) (holding that the trial court did not err “when it failed to reappoint [the defendants’] dismissed attorneys after they voluntarily absented themselves from trial,” because the defendants “were unquestionably afforded their rights to counsel and to be present, and then voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived those rights”). Although neither this Court, nor the United States Supreme Court has addressed the issue of whether a voluntarily-absent, pro se', '- 24 - defendant must have counsel appointed to represent him, we consider the above-mentioned cases to be persuasive.', 'Here, defendant voluntarily chose not to attend his trial, and, as such, we do not believe that the trial justice was required to appoint counsel to represent him. The voluntary nature of defendant’s absence from trial is significant because it was defendant’s free and informed choice that led to the result about which he now complains. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, “whatever else may be said of those who wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt that they understood the inestimable worth of free choice.” Faretta, 422 U.S. at 833-34. Here, defendant was thoroughly advised of the rights that he was surrendering by opting not to be present in the courtroom during his trial, yet he chose to do so anyway.', 'Thus, like the defendant in Clark, Mr. Eddy', '“complains that the judge conducted the trial in a manner that', 'violated [his] constitutional rights. It was, however, [his] choice to', 'conduct [his] trial in that manner, * * * rejecting the trial judge’s', 'warnings of the risks involved.

Thus, in our view, defendant “is in a similar position to a young man who murders his parents and then seeks the sympathy of the court because he is an orphan.” Thomas v. Carroll, 581 F.3d 118, 124 n.3 (3d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3462 (2010).', 'The defendant cites Thomas, 581 F.3d at 126-27, in which the Third Circuit indicated in dicta that a trial judge might be constitutionally required to appoint counsel to represent a voluntarily-absent pro se defendant. However, we do not find the dicta in that case to be convincing. In Thomas, as in the matter that is before us, a pro se defendant voluntarily absented himself from his trial. Id. at 121-22. The defendant was convicted, and his conviction was', '- 25 - affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. Id. at 122. After the defendant unsuccessfully sought habeas relief in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, he appealed the denial of his habeas petition to the Third Circuit. Id. at 123. Operating within the bounds of its limited scope of review in habeas cases, the Third Circuit affirmed the conviction, concluding that the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision was not “contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the [United States] Supreme Court.” Id. at 127.', 'Nevertheless, in dicta, the court expressed its concern with what it believed was “a complete breakdown of the adversarial process” that had occurred at the defendant’s trial. Id. at 126. The court signaled that “[i]f this appeal had come before us on a direct appeal from a federal court presented with a defendant who waived his right to counsel and then absented himself from the courtroom, we might hold differently.” 12 Id. at 127.', 'We are not moved by the language in Thomas for several reasons. First, the Third Circuit affirmed Thomas’s conviction based on the narrow standard of review in habeas petition cases, and, therefore, its hypothetical de novo review of the constitutional issue before us constituted mere dicta, because “it had no bearing on the disposition of the case.” McAninch v. State Department of Labor and Training, 64 A.3d 84, 90 (R.I. 2013); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1177 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “obiter dictum” as “[a] judicial comment made while delivering a judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential”). Second, Thomas is a bit of an outlier; indeed, it is the only case cited by defendant that suggests that either Constitution might require the appointment of counsel for a voluntarily-absent pro se defendant. We know of no other court that has addressed the issue and 12', 'Moreover, in a concurring opinion in Thomas v. Carroll, 581 F.3d 118 (3d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3462 (2010), Judge Pollak took this statement one step further, declaring that “[u]nder the hypothetical circumstances posited by the court, I not only might hold differently, I would hold differently.” Id. at 127 (Pollak, J., concurring).', '- 26 - has employed a similar rationale. See, e.g., Clark, 510 F.3d at 396-97; Torres, 140 F.3d at 401- 03; Parento, 1 Cal.Rptr.2d at 446; Brante, 232 P.3d at 208-09; Worthy, 583 N.W.2d at 279.', 'Finally, we agree with the logic of the courts that have confronted the issue, which have held that it is only when a defendant is involuntarily removed from the courtroom that the appointment of an attorney is required; when a defendant voluntarily does so, the appointment of counsel is not constitutionally required. Although the non-adversarial nature of a trial may be the same whether the pro se defendant’s absence is voluntary or involuntary, the cause of the absence (and, by extension, the cause of the non-adversarial nature of the proceeding) differs. In the case of involuntary absence, the cause of the defendant’s absence is the court-ordered removal of the pro se defendant, which carries with it the concomitant termination of the defendant’s right of self-representation. See Mack, 362 F.3d at 601 (A defendant who acts out and is removed from the courtroom “forfeits his right to represent himself in the proceeding.”). Conversely, in the case of voluntary absence by choice, the cause of the defendant’s non- presence is the defendant’s own decision to leave the courtroom, which carries with it no forfeiture of the right of self-representation. See Torres, 140 F.3d at 402 (describing the defendant’s absence from trial as an “exercise [of] her right to defend herself”). Thus, when a defendant is involuntarily removed, the appointment of an attorney is required to “step[] in to fill the gap” left by the defendant’s lack of representation after his right to self-representation is terminated. Mack, 362 F.3d at 601.', 'However, when a defendant makes the decision to voluntarily absent himself, that decision constitutes an exercise of his self-representation. Certainly, the trial justice did not violate the Constitution when he declined to interfere with defendant’s exercise of self-representation and allowed the trial to proceed without appointing counsel to take defendant’s place. See Torres, 140 F.3d at 402 (“Just as [trial] courts should not', '- 27 - ‘compel a defendant to accept a lawyer [he] does not want,’ * * * they should not interfere with the defendant’s chosen method of defense.” quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 833). 13', 'Undeniably, a pro se defendant may choose to sit silently at the defense table during trial, give no opening statement or closing argument, call and cross-examine no witnesses, and make no objections. Parento, 1 Cal.Rptr.2d at 446. We see little difference between the defendant who quietly remains in the courtroom and the defendant who instead absents himself from the proceedings. As the California First District Court of Appeals has said, “[t]he issue is not physical presence, but choice.” Id.', 'Finally, defendant contends that his purported right to have counsel appointed in his absence is derived, at least in part, from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the trial justice provided defendant with three competent and experienced attorneys, all of whom he found to be wanting and whom he ultimately discharged. The defendant delayed the proceedings an inordinate number of times, in what the trial justice correctly described as the tail attempting to wag the dog. The record clearly demonstrates that throughout the proceedings, the trial justice exercised great patience with defendant, and, indeed, he “bent over backwards” to accommodate him on numerous occasions. Furthermore, on several occasions during the course 13', 'It is not lost upon us that defendant’s position on appeal is a 180-degree reversal from the position that he took on numerous occasions throughout the proceedings below when he strenuously insisted that he be permitted to represent himself. In a motion to discharge one of defendant’s attorneys, he reaffirmed to the court “his repeated wish to act as his own counsel,” that he did “not wish for co-counsel,” that he “[could not] have forced upon him any [a]ttorney against [his] wishes,” that he “demand[ed] to exercise his right to act in a pro-se capacity,” and that he “has never waivered [sic] from that wish.” That previous position taken by defendant appears to be a more accurate reflection of the law than his argument on appeal. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834 (1975) (“[A]lthough [a defendant] may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of ‘that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.’” quoting Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 350-51 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring)); Clark v. Perez, 510 F.3d 382, 394 (2d Cir. 2008) (“The defendant’s right to counsel does not generally empower courts to force counsel upon a criminal defendant.”).', '- 28 - of the trial, the trial justice inquired as to whether defendant had any desire to resume participation in the proceedings, and defendant declined each time. Consequently, we are hard- pressed to discern what further process was due to defendant.', 'For the foregoing reasons, we hold that neither the United States Constitution, nor article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution mandates that counsel be appointed when a pro se defendant voluntarily absents himself from his trial.', 'D', 'Rule 43 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure', 'The defendant also argues that he “should not have been permitted to waive his presence at trial because he was charged with the Rhode Island equivalent of a capital crime.” Specifically, he contends that Rule 43 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure precluded the trial justice from allowing defendant to voluntarily absent himself from trial. Rule 43 provides that “[i]n prosecutions for offenses not punishable by death, the defendant’s voluntary absence after the trial has been commenced in the defendant’s presence shall not prevent continuing the trial to and including the return of the verdict.” (Emphasis added.) The phrase “not punishable by death” is clear and unambiguous, and it is abundantly obvious that the offenses with which defendant was charged were not punishable by death. See § 11-37- 3 (“Penalty for first degree sexual assault. – Every person who shall commit sexual assault in the first degree shall be imprisoned for a period not less than ten (10) years and may be imprisoned for life.”); § 11-37-8.2, as amended by P.L. 2006, ch. 207, § 3 (“Penalty for first degree child molestation sexual assault. – Every person who shall commit first degree child molestation sexual assault shall be imprisoned for a period of not less than twenty-five (25) years and may be', '- 29 - imprisoned for life.”). 14 Therefore, we fail to see how Rule 43 presented any bar to defendant’s trial continuing, even after he elected not to be present. 15', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction in this case. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. 14', 'At all times relevant to this case, the penalty for first-degree child molestation sexual assault was imprisonment “for a period of not less than twenty (20) years,” with the possibility of “imprison[ment] for life.” Section 11-37-8.2, as enacted by P.L. 1984, ch. 59, § 2. In 2006, after defendant was sentenced, the Legislature increased the minimum sentence for this crime to imprisonment “for a period of not less than twenty-five (25) years.” P.L. 2006, ch. 207, § 3. However, this fact has no bearing on our decision in this case. 15', 'The defendant also argues that count 3 of the five-count indictment was tried in an improper venue, because that particular count was alleged to have taken place in Kent County, and the trial took place in the Providence County Superior Court. Assuming, without deciding, that this argument has merit, any improper venue would, at most, constitute harmless error. The defendant was convicted of the four other counts contained in the indictment, and for each, he received life sentences—two to run concurrently with count 3, and two to run concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the others. Consequently, any error concerning only one count of the indictment would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Finally, defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the errors that he alleges requires that his judgment of conviction be vacated.

(NC 08-400) v. : Capella South Condominium Association, : Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this property dispute, Bennie Sisto (Sisto or plaintiff) appeals from two judgments of the Superior Court: (1) the granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, America Condominium Association, Inc. (America); and (2) the granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Capella South Condominium Association, Inc. (Capella), Harbor Houses Condominium Association, Inc. (Harbor Houses), and Goat Island South Condominium Association, Inc. (GIS). Additionally, Harbor Houses (a nominal defendant in the second action) appeals from the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in that action, arguing that judgment should have been granted in Sisto’s favor. All three of these appeals have been consolidated by this Court. After reviewing the record and considering the', '-1- parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we vacate in part and affirm in part the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Sisto is the owner of a condominium unit located on Goat Island in Newport, within the approximately twenty-three-acre waterfront Goat Island South Condominium community. That community was created in 1988 by a master declaration of condominium; this declaration has since been amended from time to time, and was adopted in its current form in August 2007. Goat Island South Condominium is comprised of three sub-condominium residential areas— Harbor Houses Condominium, America Condominium, and Capella South Condominium. Of the 154 total units, there are nineteen stand-alone townhouse residence units located in Harbor Houses Condominium, forty-six residence units in America Condominium, and eighty-nine residence units in Capella South Condominium. Each of these sub-condominiums is governed by a separate association and declaration and must also adhere to the provisions of the master declaration. Likewise, these declarations must comply with Rhode Island’s Condominium Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 36.1 of title 34 (the Condominium Act or Act). 1', 'Sisto owns Unit No. 1 in Harbor Houses Condominium, which is a stand-alone townhouse unit surrounded by a yard. According to §§ 1.16 and 2.3(a) of the Harbor Houses declaration, the yard surrounding Sisto’s unit is designated as a limited common element— meaning that it is “reserved for the use by one or more but fewer than all [u]nits, and intended for the exclusive use of such [u]nits.” 1', 'According to G.L. 1956 § 34-36.1-1.02(a)(1), the Condominium Act “applies to all condominiums created within [Rhode Island] after July 1, 1982 * * *.”', '-2-', 'In October 2006, Sisto filed an application with the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) for approval to demolish his existing unit and rebuild a larger dwelling thereon. 2', 'Subsequently, on January 16, 2007, America submitted a letter to the CRMC, objecting to that application. In this correspondence, America stated that Sisto “does not own the land on which he wants to expand”; as such, it continued, his proposed expansion would “deprive * * * the other unit owners [in the Goat Island South Condominium community] of [their] property.” In that letter, America also stated that Sisto’s planned expansion did not conform to the CRMC’s setback requirements.', 'Later that year, after Sisto amended his application, America and Capella wrote another letter to the CRMC, on November 26, 2007, objecting on the same grounds.', 'Subsequently, on December 7, 2007, GIS sent a letter to the CRMC, stating that America’s letter to the CRMC (in which it stated that Sisto did not own the land over which he wanted to expand) was “deceptive” because Sisto, as “one of the owners-in-common of the land underlying his proposed expansion,” had the “affirmative right” to expand his unit so long as he met the requirements set forth in both the master and Harbor Houses declarations. In a letter dated January 17, 2008, the CRMC then advised Sisto that it “lack[ed] the jurisdiction to resolve the ownership issue * * *, and [that] resolution [would] be required prior to * * * processing [Sisto’s] requested application [for expansion].” Two months after its initial letter to the CRMC, America sent a follow-up letter, on February 7, 2008, acknowledging that its statement pertaining to Sisto’s land ownership was not “technically correct” because that land was actually owned in common by all 154 unit owners. Ultimately, questioning Sisto’s ownership of the land at issue, the CRMC refused to process Sisto’s application. 2', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 46-23-1(c), the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) is “the principal mechanism for management of the state’s coastal resources.”', '-3-', 'On March 4, 2008, Sisto filed a complaint (the America action) against America and the members of its executive board in the Newport County Superior Court. In that action he sought a declaratory judgment that he had “sufficient right, title and interest in the [l]and and airspace [surrounding his unit] * * * to confer standing to file the [a]pplication [for the expansion of his unit] with the CRMC” (count 1).', 'He also sought relief for slander of title, alleging that America’s correspondence with the CRMC, in which it stated that Sisto “does not own the land on which he wants to expand,” was “maliciously published with the intent to deceive the CRMC” (count 2). Lastly, Sisto claimed that America “breached its contractual duties” to Sisto under the master declaration by virtue of that correspondence with the CRMC (count 3).', 'America answered the complaint on April 17, 2008, denying all three counts and asserting myriad affirmative defenses. 3 Five days later, on April 22, 2008, America moved for partial summary judgment on counts 2 and 3, pursuant to Rule 56(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In an accompanying memorandum, America argued that its correspondence with the CRMC was protected speech under Rhode Island’s Limits on Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 33 of title 9 (the anti-SLAPP statute), because Sisto’s purported ownership of the land at issue was a matter of “public concern” directed to a governmental body. 4 Accordingly, America averred that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on counts 2 and 3. Pursuant to § 9-33-2(b), America also moved to stay discovery on those counts, which motion was granted on June 3, 2008.', 'On May 22, 2008, Sisto moved for partial summary judgment on count 1, as well as for sanctions against America under Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In 3', 'We note that America did not file a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, which is ultimately important to our final disposition. See Part V, infra. 4', 'We discuss this statute in detail in Part IV-(B), infra.', '-4- support of that motion, Sisto maintained that both the Harbor Houses declaration and the master declaration permitted him to make improvements, alterations, and changes to his unit, and authorized him to expand his unit on adjoining land. As to sanctions, Sisto claimed that a host of the denials and affirmative defenses outlined in America’s answer to Sisto’s complaint were made in contravention of Rule 11. Both parties filed objections to the other’s respective motion for summary judgment, and America also filed a cross-motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Sisto’s counsel for, in its view, Sisto’s above-referenced meritless motion for sanctions against it.', 'Approximately two months after moving for summary judgment, on June 23, 2008, America also moved to dismiss count 1 of Sisto’s complaint based on his failure to join indispensible parties—the other 153 unit owners in the Goat Island South Condominium community—pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'Subsequently, on July 23, 2008, Sisto brought an action in Superior Court (the GIS action) against GIS and the two other sub-condominium associations in the Goat Island South Condominium community, Capella and Harbor Houses. This complaint named those three defendants as “parties in interest vis-à-vis the assertions made and positions advanced in [the America action], including those asserted in the [m]otions.” The complaint essentially parroted the allegations set forth in count 1 in the America action—that Sisto, as a Harbor Houses Condominium unit owner, was permitted and authorized to make improvements, alterations, and changes to his unit and that he had sufficient title and interest to file an application with the CRMC regarding the expansion of his unit onto adjoining land. That same day, Sisto also moved for summary judgment in that action.', 'In GIS’s answer, it neither admitted nor denied the substantive allegations. Additionally, GIS brought a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, asking the Superior Court to decide', '-5- whether (1) Sisto had standing to pursue his application with the CRMC on his own; or (2) approval of the other 153 unit owners would be necessary prior to the submission of such application; or (3) approval under § 2.3 of the master declaration was required; or (4) approval under both (2) and (3) above would be required; or (5) other statutes, rules, regulations, or documents would be applicable to the issues raised. On November 7, 2008, GIS filed a cross- motion for summary judgment. Capella answered Sisto’s complaint, denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. Harbor Houses also answered Sisto’s complaint; unlike GIS, Capella, and America, it admitted all of the complaint’s allegations and asked the Superior Court to enter judgment in Sisto’s favor. Further, Harbor Houses requested the Superior Court to issue a declaration that “Harbor House[s] Condominium unit expansions are specifically authorized by the constituent documents of the Harbor House[s] Condominium and [§] 2.3 of the [master declaration] and do not require the approval of all 154 Goat Island [South] Condominium unit owners [or] the approval of the executive boards of the other * * * sub[-]associations * * *.”', 'After a hearing held on January 16, 2009, a justice of the Superior Court denied in part and granted in part Sisto’s motion for partial summary judgment on count 1 in the America action. He found that, as a matter of law, Sisto had standing to file his application for the expansion of his unit with the CRMC; however, he issued a declaratory judgment stating that unanimous consent among the other 153 unit owners would be necessary before he could carry out that expansion. 5 The hearing justice also granted America’s motion for partial summary 5', 'Although no party has raised this issue, we note that, because America never filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment in the America action, the hearing justice did not have authority to issue the declaratory judgment in that action, in which he ruled that “consent of all 154 unit owners” would be required before Sisto could go forward with the expansion of his unit. See Nye v. Brousseau, 992 A.2d 1002, 1011 (R.I. 2010) (“[A] party should not be granted relief that it did not request.” (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 824 A.2d 1246, 1248 (R.I. 2003)). However, a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment was filed in', '-6- judgment on counts 2 and 3, concluding that the anti-SLAPP statute barred those claims. With respect to the GIS action, the hearing justice similarly granted in part and denied in part Sisto’s motion for partial summary judgment, as well as GIS’s cross-motion for summary judgment with regard to whether unanimous consent of the unit owners was necessary before Sisto could go forward with his proposed expansion. On August 27, 2009, the hearing justice issued four separate written decisions, each addressing those respective motions. We summarize those decisions below.', 'In his decision denying in part and granting in part Sisto’s motion for partial summary judgment in the America action, the hearing justice examined the master declaration, the Harbor Houses declaration and the Condominium Act. In so doing, he relied on § 2.8 of the Harbor Houses declaration (an amendment added in 1995) which expressly permitted a unit owner to “construct improvements to increase the size of the [o]wner’s [u]nit and the [b]uilding containing the [u]nit subject to [certain limitations].” Next, in reviewing the master declaration, the hearing justice determined that it “require[d] a unit owner to receive approval from the Harbor Houses Executive Board before making any alterations or changes to the exterior of the building or increasing the building’s size.”', 'However, the hearing justice reasoned, when any of the provisions of the Harbor Houses declaration or the master declaration conflict with the Condominium Act, the Condominium Act takes precedence. Further, relying on § 2.4(e) of the Harbor Houses declaration (mandating that “[a]ny changes, alterations or construction undertaken by any [u]nit [o]wner * * * shall be performed only in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations * * *”) and § 2.3(a)(i)(D) of the master declaration (stating that the GIS action with respect to whether such unanimous consent would be required. Therefore, our ultimate decision reaches the merits of the trial justice’s issuance of a declaratory judgment as to GIS’s counterclaim.', '-7- improvements, alterations, or changes to a unit “shall be done in accordance with all applicable * * * [s]tate * * * laws”), he determined that it was incumbent upon Sisto to comply with the Condominium Act.', 'The hearing justice determined that, because the yard over which Sisto sought to expand was designated as a limited common element under both the Harbor Houses declaration and the Act, that expansion “would disturb the * * * allocation” of the limited common elements by transforming part of the yard surrounding his unit (a limited common element) into his actual unit, which “would ultimately decrease each unit owner’s percentage interest in all [l]imited [c]ommon [e]lements.” Under § 34-36.1-2.17(d), he continued, the Act required unanimous consent of the other 153 unit owners in that situation. Without such consent, he concluded, Sisto was not entitled to a declaratory judgment allowing him to expand his unit. Therefore, he denied in part Sisto’s motion for partial summary judgment. With respect to Sisto’s contention that he had standing to file an application for expansion with the CRMC, the hearing justice granted summary judgment in Sisto’s favor. However, he stated that, because the CRMC had not been joined as a party, he could not mandate a corresponding obligation, on the CRMC’s part, to further process that application.', 'Granting America’s motion for summary judgment on counts 2 and 3 in that action, the hearing justice determined that America’s correspondence with the CRMC was protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. In so deciding, he concluded that (1) America’s letters to the CRMC constituted “a governmental procedure”; (2) the statements contained within those letters “constituted an issue of public concern”—meaning “public discourse regarding an issue of importance within the community”; and (3) the letters did not constitute a “sham” because they provided the CRMC with relevant information regarding the ownership of the land in question—', '-8- meaning that they were not “objectively baseless.” Furthermore, in accordance with the anti- SLAPP statute, the hearing justice granted attorneys’ fees to America, as the prevailing party. 6', 'In the GIS action, the hearing justice ruled on Sisto’s motion for summary judgment as he had in the America action, echoing the same rationale. Furthermore, in ruling on GIS’s cross- motion for summary judgment on its claim for a declaratory judgment, the hearing justice concluded that: (1) under the terms of the Act, Sisto must obtain the unanimous consent of all unit owners before submitting to the CRMC his application for the proposed expansion of his unit; (2) approval pursuant to the master declaration and the Harbor Houses declaration was also required prior to that submission; and (3) other statutes, rules, regulations, and documents were applicable to and determinative of the issues raised in that action. Further, the hearing justice denied GIS’s motion for summary judgment as to the declaration regarding Sisto’s standing to pursue his application with the CRMC. Instead, the hearing justice determined that Sisto simply had standing to file that application.', 'Following those decisions, Sisto moved for reconsideration, which was denied. Final judgment entered with respect to both actions on December 3, 2010. Sisto then timely appealed both judgments to this Court. Harbor Houses also appealed the entry of judgment in the GIS action.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Sisto contends that the hearing justice erred in concluding that his proposed expansion required the unanimous consent of the other unit owners. In support of this argument, he 6', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2(d), “[i]f the court grants the motion asserting the immunity established by this section, * * * the court shall award the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, including those incurred for the motion and any related discovery matters.”', '-9- maintains that the land surrounding his unit (over which the expansion would take place) is a limited common element—meaning that none of the other unit owners has any authority to use it. According to § 2.8 of the Harbor Houses declaration, he continues, improvements that increase the size of a unit are also identified as limited common elements. He therefore asserts that § 34- 36.1-2.17(d)—mandating unanimous consent of all unit owners before unit boundaries may be altered—is not triggered because, under the terms of the Harbor Houses declaration, his proposed expansion would not alter his unit boundaries. Additionally, Sisto ascribes error to the hearing justice’s conclusion that America’s correspondence with the CRMC was protected speech under the anti-SLAPP statute.', 'Harbor Houses parrots the arguments made by Sisto in his brief to this Court.', 'It maintains that § 2.3 of the master declaration and § 2.8 of the Harbor Houses declaration both provide that any improvements to a Harbor Houses Condominium unit are identified as limited common elements appurtenant to that unit. Thus, because the expansion would not change the unit boundaries, unanimous consent is not required under § 34-36.1-2.17(d). Further, Harbor Houses asserts, the contemplated expansion would not reallocate the limited common elements; likewise, unanimous consent is not required under § 34-36.1-2.17(d).', 'In support of this last argument, Harbor Houses posits that Sisto’s improvement over a limited common element would not alter the total square footage of land allocated to Harbor Houses Condominium under the master declaration. Additionally, it points out that ten other Harbor Houses unit owners have made improvements to their respective units and constructed these improvements over limited common elements without the unanimous consent of the 154 unit owners.', 'Countering Sisto’s and Harbor Houses’s contentions on appeal, America and Capella submitted a joint brief to this Court. They argue that the hearing justice correctly ruled that Sisto', '- 10 - must obtain the unanimous consent of the other 153 unit owners before expanding his unit. In support of this argument, they maintain that § 34-36.1-2.17(d) prohibits changing a condominium unit’s boundaries without first obtaining such consent.', 'Likening a limited common element to an easement, they posit that, although Sisto may have exclusive use of the yard appurtenant to his unit, the scope of this use does not give him unilateral authority to build on it.', 'In response to Sisto’s criticism of the hearing justice’s application of the anti-SLAPP statute, America maintains that its correspondence with the CRMC clearly satisfied the elements of that statute. Therefore, the hearing justice correctly determined that those letters were entitled to conditional immunity from Sisto’s claims of breach of contract and slander of title. Lastly, GIS asserts that the hearing justice correctly concluded that Sisto’s expansion required the unanimous consent of the other 153 unit owners, pursuant to § 34-36.1-2.17(d), and urges this Court to affirm the judgment with respect to the GIS action.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'We review a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.

However, both of those declarations are subject to the Condominium Act, which, we conclude, requires Sisto to obtain such consent before expanding his unit. In arriving at this conclusion, we review the master declaration, the Harbor Houses declaration, and the Act.', 'Section 2.3(a)(i) of the master declaration states, in pertinent part:', '“Improvements, alterations or changes may be made to any', 'building * * * of Harbor Houses Condominium to the extent', 'permitted by its [d]eclaration as of June 30, 2007. No alteration,', 'change in the exterior appearance or increase in the size of any', 'building (‘improvements’) shall be made that is not first approved', 'by the Harbor Houses Condominium executive board and that does', 'not comply with [certain enumerated restrictions].” Among those restrictions is a prohibition against an improvement encroaching (1) onto the yard designated as a limited common element of an adjoining residence unit; and (2) beyond the limited common elements of the residence unit that is being improved, altered, or changed. Additionally, § 2.3(a)(i)(M) of the master declaration states that', '“if any such improvements, alterations or increases in the', 'size of any building would extend any portion of the building in', 'which such unit is contained beyond the ‘footprint,’ so called, of', 'the building * * * and change the exterior appearance of any', 'building * * *, then the written final plans approved by the Harbor', 'Houses Condominium executive board * * * shall be submitted to', 'the [Goat Island South Condominium] Executive Board for review', 'and a written advisory opinion * * *.”', '- 13 - Thus, there is nothing in the master declaration that requires Sisto to obtain the unanimous consent of the other 153 unit owners before expanding his unit.', 'Likewise, the Harbor Houses declaration does not require such unanimous consent. Pursuant to § 2.4(g) of the Harbor Houses declaration, a unit owner must first obtain the written consent of the executive board before “mak[ing] or caus[ing] to be made any alterations or changes to any * * * [l]imited [c]ommon [e]lement (including, without limitation, the exterior of the [b]uilding in which such * * * [u]nit is located) * * *.” Further, a 1995 amendment to the Harbor Houses declaration, entitled § 2.8, expressly allows a unit owner to', '“construct improvements to increase the size of the [o]wner’s', '[u]nit and the [b]uilding containing the [u]nit subject to the', 'following: (a) the improvements shall constitute a [l]imited', '[c]ommon [e]lement for the benefit of such [u]nit; [and] (b) the', 'improvements shall not encroach on the yard designated as a', '[l]imited [c]ommon [e]lement for the adjoining [u]nit * * *.” Therefore, it appears that the Harbor Houses declaration permits a unit owner to expand the footprint of his or her unit onto his or her yard, so long as that expansion does not encroach onto the yard of the neighboring unit.', 'However, in addition to the declarations, the Act “applies to all condominiums created * * * after July 1, 1982 * * *.” Section 34-36.1-1.02(a)(1). As stated above, the Goat Island South Condominium community was created in 1988—well after the Act took effect. Both of the above-referenced declarations are therefore subject to the Act. See America I, 844 A.2d at 127. Moreover, § 2.3(a)(i)(D) of the master declaration provides that “[improvements, alterations, or changes] * * * shall be done in accordance with all applicable * * * [s]tate * * * laws.” Additionally, § 2.8(f) of the Harbor Houses declaration states that improvements to increase the', '- 14 - size of the unit and the building containing the unit “shall be done in accordance [with] all applicable * * * [s]tate * * * laws * * *.”', 'Turning to the relevant portions of the Act, § 34-36.1-2.17(d) states that “no amendment may * * * change the boundaries of any unit, [or] the allocated interests of a unit, * * * in the absence of unanimous consent of the unit owners.” (Emphasis added.). Under the Act, a unit is defined as “a physical portion of the condominium designated for separate ownership or occupancy, the boundaries of which are described pursuant to [the declaration].” Section 34- 36.1-1.03(28). After carefully reviewing the master declaration, we find that it does not appear to include a specific definition of a unit, although § 1.18 provides that a Goat Island South Condominium unit refers to each of the three sub-condominiums—the America, Capella, and Harbor Houses condominiums. However, § 1.27 of that declaration also states that a “unit owner” is the “owner of a [r]esidence [u]nit”—meaning the owner of a unit contained within one of the three sub-condominiums. According to § 1.31 of the Harbor Houses declaration, a unit is “a physical portion of the [c]ondominium designated for separate ownership * * *.” Section 2.3 of that declaration further provides that “[t]he boundaries of each of the [u]nits * * * are the floors, ceilings, walls, doors and windows * * *.”', 'In what appears to be a legal fiction, both § 2.3(a)(i)(P) of the master declaration and § 2.8(a) of the Harbor Houses declaration provide that improvements which increase the size of a unit are designated as limited common elements. Therefore, if a unit owner expands his or her unit onto the adjacent yard, that expanded portion becomes a limited common element. Clearly, the declarations ascribe a meaning to a limited common element contrary to that of the Act. Under the Act, a limited common element is “a portion of the common elements allocated by the declaration * * * for the exclusive use of one or more but fewer than all of the units.” Section', '- 15 - 34-36.1-1.03(19). “[C]ommon element[s]” are defined as “all portions of a condominium other than the units.” Section 34-36.1-1.03(4) (emphasis added). By definition, then, a unit is not a limited common element. Thus, by labeling such expansion as a limited common element, both declarations attempt to avoid the Act’s requirement of unanimous consent before expanding a unit beyond its original boundaries.', 'We readily acknowledge that, where expressly provided for in the Act, condominium declarations may vary from the Act’s provisions. See Section 34-36.1-1.04. In that regard, some of the defined terms used in the Act may be defined differently in a declaration. Section 34- 36.1-1.03.', 'However, we emphasize that, “[r]egardless of how terms are used in [the] [declarations], * * * terms have an unvarying meaning in the Act, and any restricted practice which depends on the definition of a term is not affected by a changed term in the [declarations].” Commissioners’ Comment 1 to § 34-36.1-1.03. Thus, while the terms of a declaration may differ from the Act in certain situations, as we explain below, we deem this not to be one of them.', 'As noted above, the declarations give a meaning to a limited common element that directly contravenes a restricted practice in the Act, to which they are subject. Accordingly, § 34-36.1-2.17(d)—declaring that a unit owner must obtain unanimous consent of all other unit owners before changing the boundaries of his or her unit—cannot be undercut by the declarations’ attempt to differentiate any expansion to a unit from the unit itself by characterizing the expanded portion of a unit as a limited common element, rather than as a new part of the unit. The Act explicitly states that a unit is distinct from a limited common element. Thus, we hold that, because Sisto’s proposed expansion would “change the boundaries of [his] unit,” he must obtain the unanimous consent of all other unit owners before going forward with that expansion.', '- 16 - See § 34-36.1-2.17(d). 8 Since the Act defines a unit owner as a “person who owns a unit,” which includes an owner of a sub-condominium unit, the unanimous consent must be from the other 153 unit owners. 9 See § 34-36.1-1.03(29) and America I, 844 A.2d at 130.', 'B', 'The Anti-SLAPP Issue', '“The anti-SLAPP statute was enacted to prevent vexatious lawsuits against citizens who exercise their First Amendment rights of free speech and legitimate petitioning by granting those activities conditional immunity from punitive civil claims.” Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 752 (R.I. 2004). To that effect, § 9-33-1 states, in pertinent part:', '“The legislature finds and declares that full participation by', 'persons and organizations and robust discussion of issues of public', 'concern before * * * administrative bodies * * * are essential to the', 'democratic process, that there has been a disturbing increase in', 'lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the', 'constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the', 'redress of grievances; that such litigation is disfavored and should 8', 'Although the hearing justice did not explicitly rely on § 34-36.1-2.17(d)’s requirement that a unit owner obtain unanimous consent prior to changing the unit’s boundaries, it is well settled that we may affirm his decision on these alternate grounds. See Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010) (citing State v. Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 847 (R.I. 2001)).', 'Because we hold that Sisto must obtain unanimous consent before changing his unit’s boundaries, we do not address whether this change affects the allocated interests of any of the units under § 34-36.1-2.17(d). 9', ""This mandate may seem draconian; however, when “[a] statute is within the power of the [L]egislature to enact, it is the duty of the court to sustain it, irrespective of its own opinion of the wisdom, reasonableness, or necessity for the statute.” In re Rule Amendments to Rules 5.4(a) & 7.2(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, 815 A.2d 47, 49 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Creditors' Service Corp. v. Cummings, 57 R.I. 291, 299, 190 A. 2, 8 (1937)). Moreover, as we have often noted, the Act is a consumer-protection statute. America Condominium Association, Inc. v. IDC, Inc., 870 A.2d 434, 437 (R.I. 2005) (“‘[A]s a whole[, the Act] contains a strong consumer protection flavor,’ because of ‘a perceived need for additional consumer protection.’” (quoting America I, 844 A.2d at 128)). Ownership of the common elements (which, by definition, includes all of the limited common elements) is held in common by the 154 unit owners. As such, we do not deem it unreasonable that the 154 unit owners must consent to unit boundary changes over land which they own in common—namely, limited common elements."", '- 17 -', 'be resolved quickly with minimum cost to citizens who have', 'participated in matters of public concern.” However, this Court is mindful that there is a balance that must take place with respect to the applicability of the anti-SLAPP statute. As we previously recognized in Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144 (R.I. 2008), the anti-SLAPP statute', '“pit[s] two sets of fundamental constitutional rights against each', 'other: (1) defendants’ rights of free speech and petition and (2)', 'plaintiffs’ rights of access to the judicial system and rights to non-', 'falsely maligned reputations. Solutions to [this] problem must not', 'compromise any of these rights. Plaintiffs must be able to bring', 'suits with reasonable merit and defendants must be protected from', 'entirely frivolous intimidation * * * in public affairs.” Id. at 150 n.', '11 (quoting John C. Barker, Common-Law and Statutory Solutions', 'to the Problem of SLAPPs, 26 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 395, 397-98', '(1993)). Thus, the anti-SLAPP statute should “be limited in scope,” and “[g]reat caution should be the watchword in this area.” Id. at 150, 150 n.10. With that in mind, we turn to the merits of America’s anti-SLAPP affirmative defense.', 'According to § 9-33-2(a), “[a] party’s exercise of his or her right of petition or of free speech [before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding] * * * in connection with a matter of public concern shall be conditionally immune from civil claims, counterclaims, or cross-claims.” However, that speech will not enjoy protection if it “constitutes a sham,” meaning that it is “not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome, regardless of ultimate motive or purpose.” Id.', 'The anti-SLAPP statute can therefore be broken down into three elements. We examine their application to these facts. First, America’s correspondence with the CRMC constitutes an “exercise of [its] right * * * of free speech” because it was in the form of a “written * * *', '- 18 - statement * * * made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative * * * body”—in this case, the CRMC. See § 9-33-2(e). Second, that correspondence dealt with a “matter of public concern” because Sisto’s proposed unit expansion would impact the other unit owners in the Goat Island South community. Third, in order for the correspondence to fall within the embrace of the protections afforded by the anti-SLAPP statute, the correspondence must not have constituted a sham.', 'In determining this last element, we examine whether the statements made to the CRMC were “genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome, regardless of ultimate motive or purpose.” Section 9-33-2(a). Further, we must examine whether the statements were “(1) [o]bjectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable person exercising the right of speech * * * could realistically expect success in procuring the government action, result, or outcome, and (2) [s]ubjectively baseless in the sense that it is actually an attempt to use the governmental process itself for its own direct effects.” Section 9-33-2(a). With respect to whether the statements are subjectively baseless, we consider “whether the litigants ‘utilized the process itself rather than the intended outcome in order to hinder and delay [a] plaintiff.’” Karousos v. Pardee, 992 A.2d 263, 271 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Pound Hill Corp. v. Perl, 668 A.2d 1260, 1264 (R.I. 1996)).', 'We cannot disagree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that America’s correspondence with the CRMC was aimed at procuring a favorable government outcome—that is, an outcome that aligned with the rights of the unit owners in the Goat Island South community. Sisto asserts that, “[h]ad [America] accurately advised [the] CRMC that [he] [did] not exclusively own the land” over which he sought to expand, he would not have brought a slander of title claim against America, thereby avoiding any anti-SLAPP issue. We agree that the language of the letter could', '- 19 - have been more forthright; however, we cannot say that America’s failure to accurately state that Sisto did not “exclusively” own the land rendered the statement objectively baseless. That statement was a reasonable attempt on the part of America to alert the CRMC that Sisto did not have sufficient ownership of the land over which he sought to expand his unit. We cannot say that America’s correspondence was an unreasonable attempt to achieve favorable government action.', 'Lastly, we conclude that America’s correspondence with the CRMC was not subjectively baseless. There is no suggestion that America sent the letter to simply hinder or delay Sisto’s expansion, without the ultimate intended outcome of achieving favorable government action— that is, preventing him from actually expanding his unit. See Karousos, 992 A.2d at 271. In sum, we hold that America’s correspondence with the CRMC enjoys the protections afforded by the anti-SLAPP statute.', 'In disagreeing with our application of the anti-SLAPP statute, the dissent posits that “the [anti-SLAPP] statute may suffer from constitutional infirmities because the definition of petitioning activity * * * is overly broad and not confined to issues of public concern.” Although the dissent raises an interesting issue for discussion, neither party has challenged the constitutionality of the anti-SLAPP statute. In light of our well-settled precedent cautioning against our sua sponte review of a statute’s constitutionality, we deem it imprudent to engage in such a review in this case. See State v. DeRobbio, 62 A.3d 1113, 1119 (R.I. 2013) (“[A] trial justice does not have the authority to sua sponte attack the constitutionality of a statute; it must be raised by a party entitled to make such challenge.” (quoting Devane v. Devane, 581 A.2d 264, 265 (R.I. 1990)). Moreover, this Court has previously declared that the anti-SLAPP statute is constitutional.', 'See Hometown Properties, Inc. v. Fleming, 680 A.2d 56, 60 (R.I. 1996)', '- 20 - (resolving that the anti-SLAPP statute passed constitutional muster with respect to challenges asserting equal protection, the right to a trial by jury, due process, and denial of access to state courts, among other things).', 'Additionally, in citing to our “learned colleagues in Massachusetts” for their decision in Duracraft Corp. v. Holmes Products Corp., 691 N.E.2d 935 (Mass. 1998), the dissent seemingly overlooks the fact that, in that case the court was explicitly called upon to answer whether Massachusetts’s anti-SLAPP statute was constitutional. Id. at 937, 939. As stated above, this Court has been asked no such question in this case.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate in part and affirm in part the judgments of the Superior Court. Because America did not file a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, we vacate the declaratory judgment issued in the America action with respect to whether unanimous consent is required before Sisto may go forward with the expansion of his unit. See note 5, supra. However, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in that action with respect to Sisto’s standing to file the application for expansion with the CRMC, as well as with respect to the anti-SLAPP issue. Additionally, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in the GIS action declaring that the unanimous consent of the 154 unit owners must be obtained before Sisto may carry out his unit expansion. The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court.', '- 21 -', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in that portion of the majority decision that holds that the plaintiff is required to obtain the unanimous consent of all unit owners before he may expand his unit in the manner in which he proposed―that is, onto the limited common elements of the condominium. However, because we part company on the application of the anti-SLAPP statute to the facts in this case, I respectfully dissent. It is my opinion that the challenged communications in this case—one written by the president of America Condominium and the other by an attorney engaged on behalf of his clients—amounted to actionable slander of title such that there was a factual basis for the claim. Accordingly, the immunity provisions of the anti-SLAPP statute are not available, and the award of attorney’s fees should be vacated.', 'The parties before the Court are three condominium associations and the various unit owners of condominiums that make up the Goat Island South (GIS) condominium community. They are in privity. This is a dispute over a provision in the declaration for one of three sub- condominiums within the master GIS condominium. The majority opinion has acknowledged that, by its plain terms, § 2.3 of the Harbor Houses declarations permitted the expansion that Sisto proposed without the unanimous consent of the other unit owners. According to the record before us, other owners of Harbor Houses units already had expanded their townhouses in a like manner. Until today, the Harbor Houses declaration permitted a unit owner to expand his or her unit onto the limited common elements without first obtaining the consent of the unit owners. The parties in this case were engaged in a legitimate dispute concerning whether Sisto could expand onto the limited common elements of his unit. That dispute was resolved, as it should have been, by the courts, and not by the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC). The communications to the CRMC declaring that Sisto did not own the land on which he sought to', '- 22 - build flatly were untrue, and it was alleged that they were intended to stop the CRMC from reviewing Sisto’s application. They apparently succeeded without disclosure of § 2.3 of the Harbor Houses declaration. Thus, there exists a factual basis for the claim of slander of title, and defendants should not be accorded immunity simply because the misrepresentations were made to a public agency in connection with its permitting responsibilities. Because I do not agree with the majority’s conclusion that this was protected activity for which the declarants enjoy immunity, I would vacate the award of attorney’s fees against plaintiff.', 'The provisions of the anti-SLAPP statute come into play only after a lawsuit has been filed in our courts. The act is designed to cut short “lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances[.]” G.L. 1956 § 9-33-1 (emphasis added). This salutary goal is accomplished by affording one party to that lawsuit conditional immunity from civil claims that are “directed at petition or free speech,” unless the petition or free speech “constitutes a sham” as that term is defined in the statute. Section 9-33-2(a) (emphasis added). In my opinion, there must be a threshold determination that there is no factual basis for the claim and that the claim was “brought primarily to chill the valid exercise” of the right of free speech or petition. Section 9- 33-1.', 'However laudable its goals, the anti-SLAPP statute also denies the adverse party his or her right of access to our courts and deprives that party of a judicial remedy that is guaranteed by our Constitution. It is this Court’s duty to guard against the wrongful denial of access to our courts. Those who are injured turn to the courts for justice; they should not lightly be turned away. All doubts regarding the legitimacy of a claim in the anti-SLAPP context should be resolved in favor of allowing the case to proceed in the ordinary course. Where, as here, it is', '- 23 - undisputed that there is a factual basis for the lawsuit, dismissal and a mandatory award of attorney’s fees is inappropriate. The anti-SLAPP statute includes a provision mandating the award of attorney’s fees—granted in this case—and even provides for the more draconian specter of the mandatory award of compensatory damages, with the possibility of punitive damages, in certain cases. See § 9-33-2(d). (This, of course, would require a jury trial, with the prospect of further protracted litigation.)', 'Thus, because the anti-SLAPP statute is strong medicine—but necessary at times—I am of the opinion that only claims with no substantial basis, which fairly can be classified as primarily relating to “petitioning activity,” should be immune. Intentional torts, committed by persons with vested business interests in the outcome, particularly when they have standing to have the dispute adjudicated in an appropriate forum, should not qualify.', 'One of the letters that led to plaintiff’s claim of slander of title was written by an attorney, on behalf of his clients, during the course of the attorney-client relationship. The other letter was signed by Natalie D. Volpe (Volpe), as president of the Executive Board of America Condominium. In her two-page letter, Volpe declares that “[t]he applicant does not own the land on which he wants to expand.” By letter dated September 11, 2007, Volpe, on behalf of America Condominium, withdrew America’s substantive objection to plaintiff’s application. The letter said nothing about Sisto’s title to his property.', 'The second communication, a letter authored by attorney R. Daniel Prentiss (Prentiss), on November 26, 2007, “on behalf of America Condominium Association and Capella Condominium Association[,]” included a substantive objection to the application, citing various', '- 24 - CRMC regulations—which clearly constitutes protected petitioning activity. 10', 'However, attorney Prentiss also wrote that, “[m]y clients further object to the application because the applicant is not the owner of the property on which the proposed activities will take place.” This statement was incorrect. By letter dated February 7, 2008, Prentiss corrected the inaccuracies set forth in his earlier letter.', 'Thus, the statements contained in each letter were not accurate. At best, they were the result of sloppy draftsmanship; at worst, they amounted to slander of title designed to stop the CRMC. What is clear to me is that there was a good-faith basis for plaintiff’s counsel to include a count for slander of title in the complaint in this case. This is what we expect of lawyers, who must comply with Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11 provides in relevant part:', '“The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by', 'the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other', 'paper; that to the best of the signer’s knowledge, information, and', 'belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact', 'and is warranted by existing law * * * and * * * is not interposed', 'for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause', 'unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.', '* * * If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of', 'this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may', 'impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both,', 'any appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the', 'other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses', 'incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other', 'paper, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Although plaintiff may not have prevailed on his claim for slander of title, that is not for the court to decide at summary judgment. It is my belief that, because there was a good-faith basis for the claim, no trial justice would impose Rule 11 sanctions in the context of this case, the 10', 'Curiously, the Prentiss letter of November 26, 2007, appears to renew the substantive objection to plaintiff’s application that had been withdrawn by America Condominium on September 11, 2007.', '- 25 - anti-SLAPP escape clause notwithstanding. These sound principles governing the practice of law in this honorable profession should not be sacrificed on the altar of “petitioning activity.”', 'In his complaint, Sisto alleged that the statements were false—they were, as acknowledged by at least one author—and were “maliciously published with the intent to deceive the CRMC and to stop [Sisto’s] [a]pplication from going forward.” Sisto also alleged that the defendants “made those false statements[] with full knowledge that they were indeed inaccurate because [d]efendants were well aware that under the GIS Master Declaration and Condominium Act[, Sisto] has an undivided common ownership right and interest in the [l]and at the [s]ite.”', 'Finally, the complaint alleged that, “[a]s a result of [d]efendant[’]s malicious conduct, the CRMC has halted the [a]pplication process causing [Sisto] to suffer damages, including without limitation legal fees and expenses.” These allegations set forth a claim for slander of title. In conducting its de novo review in this case, the majority acknowledges that the communication was false—“the language of the letter could have been more forthright”—but the majority then resolves this issue by concluding that defendants merely failed to state “that Sisto did not ‘exclusively’ own the land” and, therefore, the statement was not objectively baseless. In my opinion, the majority inappropriately resolves an issue of fact at summary judgment. Because there is a factual basis for the claim, my de novo review leads to the conclusion that summary dismissal and the mandatory award of attorney’s fees was wrong.', 'Not all speech and petitioning activity is protected by the Constitution. Just as one may not cry, “Fire!” in a crowded theater, a party who defames another or slanders his or her title to property may have to answer in our courts for his or her alleged tortious conduct. Intentional and allegedly malicious misstatements are not protected speech. Clearly, a complaint filed seeking recompense for the intentional tort of slander of title—where there is a factual basis for the', '- 26 - allegation—does not meet the legislative definition of a “lawsuit[] brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances * * *.” Section 9-33-1 (emphasis added). It is my belief that whether a person has engaged in protected petitioning activity, such that the anti-SLAPP statute affords conditional immunity, should be the first order of business in these cases. This determination, in my opinion, requires more than a simple application of a statutory formula. The complaint should be examined in light of the intended purpose of the statute and the mischief to be remedied: to prevent the chill of one’s First Amendment freedoms by the filing of a lawsuit “brought primarily to chill the valid exercise” of a person’s constitutional rights.', 'Section 9-33-1 (emphasis added). Furthermore, because the full application of the anti-SLAPP statute results in a final judgment, great care should be taken to guard against the denial of access to our courts.', 'Critically, § 9-33-2(a) provides immunity for any claim or counterclaim, “except if the petition or free speech constitutes a sham.” “The petition or free speech constitutes a sham only if it is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome, regardless of ultimate motive or purpose.” Id. (emphases added). In order to constitute a sham, the petition or free speech must be objectively baseless, such “that no reasonable person * * * could realistically expect success,” and subjectively baseless, “in the sense that it is actually an attempt to use the governmental process itself for its own direct effects.” Section 9-33-2(a)(1) and (2). This is an insurmountable burden with respect to the myriad cases that come before our public agencies. As we recognized in Karousos v. Pardee, 992 A.2d 263, 269 (R.I. 2010), this Court “never ha[s] held that a defendant’s actions were objectively baseless.” One can only wonder about a communication to a public agency that no reasonable person could expect to be successful.', '- 27 -', 'Importantly, the sham exception, the only available defense under the statute, is silent on the issue that is of concern to me: What about those communications for which there is a factual basis to support a claim of tortious conduct? Petitioning activity that amounts to slander, defamation, or slander of title—or, in the case of judicial filings, misstatements or contumacious behavior by an attorney and officer of the Court—should not be immune. See Clarke v. Morsilli, 723 A.2d 785, 786 (R.I. 1998) (mem.) (“[C]ontemptuous tactics and arguments [of counsel] can be as easily made on paper as in open court.”).

This is so because of the broad sweep of the definition of “petitioning activity” as set forth in § 9-33-2(e), which provides:', '“As used in this section, ‘a party’s exercise of its right of', 'petition or of free speech’ shall mean any written or oral statement', 'made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial', 'body, or any other governmental proceeding; any written or oral', 'statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or', 'review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other', 'governmental proceeding; or any written or oral statement made in', 'connection with an issue of public concern.” (Emphases added.)', '- 28 -', 'In the absence of a threshold determination that the challenged lawsuit was “directed at petition or free speech” and does not have a good-faith factual basis other than, or in addition to, the petitioning activity, the statute may suffer from constitutional infirmities because the definition of petitioning activity set forth in § 9-33-2(e) is overly broad and not confined to issues of public concern. By its terms, § 9-33-2(e) embraces any written or oral communication to virtually any public body, including filings in this Court.', 'In my opinion, the Legislature did not intend to immunize its citizens from otherwise wrongful comment. For example, suppose the defendant-declarant in a defamation suit had petitioned a state agency to discharge a public employee whose contract was up for renewal and falsely stated that the person had committed a criminal offense, suffered from a “loathsome disease,” conducted himself or herself in a manner that was “incompatible with his [or her] business, trade, profession, or office,” or was guilty of “serious sexual misconduct.” Marcil v. Kells, 936 A.2d 208, 212 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 570 at 186 (1977)). These statements, of course, amount to slander per se and are actionable without the necessity of proving special harm. Id.

The Court explained that “[t]he objective of SLAPP suits is not to win them, but to use litigation to intimidate opponents’ exercise of rights of petitioning and speech.” Id. Notably, the Court in Duracraft referred to an advisory opinion issued by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, Opinion of the Justices, 641 A.2d 1012', '- 30 - (N.H. 1994), in which the New Hampshire Supreme Court acknowledged the difficulties in distinguishing SLAPP cases from ordinary lawsuits. 11 See Duracraft, 691 N.E.2d at 940.', 'The Court in Duracraft expressed its doubts “that the Legislature intended to create an absolute privilege” for a broad group of potential claims, or that the statute was intended to reach claims between business competitors or in cases where dismissal is sought “not to limit ‘strategic litigation,’ but as an additional litigation tactic.” Duracraft, 691 N.E.2d at 940-41. Because the Legislature was silent with respect to the statute’s “breadth and reach, and ignored its potential uses in litigation far different from the typical SLAPP suit[,]” the Court adopted a narrowing construction. Id. at 941. The Court noted that the focus of the existing statutory test was strictly focused on the complained-of speech without regard to the merits of the plaintiff’s claim. Id. at 942. “The Massachusetts statute makes no provision for a plaintiff to show that its own claims are not frivolous.” Id. Our statute suffers from the same malady. What about the plaintiff who truly has been injured during the course of a matter of public concern? Where does he or she go to obtain redress?', 'Because the statute in Massachusetts focused solely on the petitioning activity with no regard for the merits of the underlying claim, the Court declared that it potentially impinged on the other party’s right of petition, thus altering the substantive law in a sweeping way. Duracraft, 691 N.E.2d at 942-43. The Court adopted a limiting construction that excludes motions to dismiss “brought against meritorious claims with a substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities * * *.” Id. at 943 (emphasis added).

Such a showing, the Court concluded, “should serve to distinguish meritless from meritorious claims, as was intended by the Legislature.” Id.', 'In conclusion, it is my opinion that, before a party is declared immune from suit under the anti-SLAPP statute, a threshold showing must be made that the claim brought against the party is not meritorious and that the suit solely is based on the plaintiff’s petitioning activities and not in addition to those activities. Because I am of the belief that the claim of slander of title was meritorious and was brought in good faith, based on misrepresentations by the parties or their counsel, separate and apart from the defendants’ petitioning activity, I would vacate the award of attorney’s fees.

11,: v. : James Robert McCulloch. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. After a protracted, if not epic, battle in the Family Court, the plaintiff, Hope Billings McCulloch (Hope), appeals from a decision that granted her complaint and the counterclaim of the defendant, James Robert McCulloch (James), for an absolute divorce. 1 At the heart of this matter is the distribution of the stock of Microfibres, Inc. (Microfibres), a manufacturer of fabric—of which James is the president and chief executive officer—and Microfibres Partnership Limited (MPL), an affiliated company that owns certain equipment and real estate in North Carolina.', 'On appeal, Hope argues that the trial justice erred: (1) in his determination of the percentage of MPL that was marital property; (2) by declining to place a value on Microfibres before he divided the marital estate; (3) by disregarding a consent order that set forth the date as of which the marital property was to be valued; (4) by assigning Hope 25 percent of Microfibres, thereby rendering her a minority shareholder in a closely held corporation; (5) by declining to award Hope alimony; (6) by awarding Hope only $1,000 per week in child support; (7) by 1', 'In this case, we refer to the parties as Hope and James. This is for the purpose of clarity only, and we intend no disrespect by using their first names.', '-1- declining to award Hope fees for her attorneys, experts, and the supervisor of James’s visits with their son Lucas James McCulloch (Lucas); and (8) by declining to order the disclosure of certain documents and information concerning James’s will, trusts, and estate plans. Conversely, in a protective and conditional cross-appeal, James argues that the trial justice erred when he held that Microfibres was a marital asset and not an advance on his inheritance. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the Family Court’s decision pending entry of final judgment, and we remand the matter to that tribunal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'I', 'Background', 'Hope and James were married on February 14, 1989. They separated in the early part of 2005, and on June 16, 2006, Hope filed a complaint for an absolute divorce. James filed an answer and counterclaim on May 7, 2007.', 'As grounds for divorce, both parties cited irreconcilable differences which caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. The parties have two children, Bay Billings McCulloch, who is no longer a minor, and Lucas, who reached the age of nineteen on June 18, 2013.', 'A', 'Proceedings Below', 'There were extensive proceedings in the Family Court that spanned almost five years, producing a veritable mountain of documents and transcripts. For the sake of brevity, we will recount only the portions of the record that are relevant to this appeal, and we will provide additional facts in our discussion where necessary.', '-2-', 'It is significant that on October 17, 2008, during the course of the divorce proceedings, the parties entered into a consent order that embodied various agreements and stipulations that they previously had made. The pertinent provisions of that consent order read as follows:', '“31.', 'Neither party shall challenge: a) the date of valuation of', 'any appraisal of real estate, equipment, machinery or the', 'parties’ possessions by any expert after October 1, 2007, or', 'b) the date of the valuation of Microfibres, Inc. by any', 'expert after October 1, 2007.', '“32.', 'For purposes of the rule that marital assets should be valued', 'as of the date of trial unless there are compelling', 'circumstances warranting a deviation, and by agreement of', 'the parties, the dates of appraisals and valuation referenced', 'in paragraph 31 above shall be considered as if they were', 'appraised on the date of trial.', '“33.', 'Nothing in paragraphs 31 or 32 above shall impair or', 'prejudice the rights of either party to challenge any', 'valuation or appraisal on the merits, other than based on: 1)', 'the date of the valuation or appraisal, or 2) any change in', 'circumstances surrounding the valued assets from February', 'to May 27, 2008, unless such change of circumstances is', 'determined by the trial justice to be an extraordinary', 'change in circumstances that could not have been', 'contemplated by the parties, provided, however, that the', 'party in possession of any asset shall not claim, contend or', 'urge that any such extraordinary change of circumstances', 'shall have occurred with respect to any such asset unless he', 'or she has disclosed such change of circumstances', 'promptly and in no event more than three business days', 'after the change in circumstance having occurred.”', 'At trial, the court heard testimony from Mary Ann Beirne, the chief financial officer of Microfibres. She testified about the company’s plan to purchase a controlling interest in a printing and dyeing company in China (the China venture). Ms. Beirne further testified that if the China venture were to fall through, it would be devastating for Microfibres. James also testified that Microfibres had been losing money each year and that the success of the China venture was vital to the survival of the company.', '-3-', 'Three experts testified about the value of Microfibres and MPL. Peri Ann Aptaker, a certified public accountant (CPA), testified on behalf of Hope; John Brough, Jr., CPA, testified on behalf of James; and Jay Fishman, a neutral, court-appointed expert engaged to assist the trial justice regarding the valuation of the two business entities, also testified. Aptaker was called upon first. She testified that she prepared a report embodying her opinion that the fair market value of Microfibres, as of December 31, 2007 was $126,365,000. 2 However, she also testified that she “couldn’t place [a] value o[n] the China investment,”—which was initiated after December 31, 2007—because she had no data available to her that she could use to predict what impact, if any, that that venture might have on Microfibres. Aptaker was later recalled to testify at a time when she had more information available to her about the China venture; however, even in this later testimony, she said that she had not completed an updated valuation of the company and that the numbers she had reviewed with regard to the China venture were merely estimates. Therefore, she remained unable to “provide an opinion of value with respect to the China venture.” Finally, she testified that one must take into account the state of the economy when valuing a company. In fact, the trial justice took judicial notice of the worldwide economic crisis that had occurred since the valuation date to which the parties had agreed.', 'John Brough, Jr., James’s expert, then testified. He opined that a $126 million value for Microfibres was not justified. Rather, his analysis led him to believe that the company had a value of $106 million. Similar to Aptaker, he testified that when valuing the company he “had no available information about the [China venture] because the deal was not closed” as of December 31, 2007. 2', 'Although the consent order provided that the valuation date was to be October 1, 2007, throughout the record and in the parties’ briefs, the trial justice and the parties refer to the valuation date as December 31, 2007. After a thorough review of the record, this Court is unaware of when, or even if, the valuation date was formally changed to December 31, 2007.', '-4-', 'Finally, Jay Fishman, the court-appointed expert, testified. He said that “there ha[d] been a meltdown in the financial market since” the December 31, 2007 valuation date. He testified that “consumer spending [wa]s way off” and “millions of jobs ha[d] been lost. So the financial conditions of the * * * countries [Microfibres] would sell to and sell in * * * ha[d] changed dramatically.” Additionally, he said, “[b]oth [parties’] experts received insufficient information and, therefore, I received insufficient information to place a value or an economic benefit on the China venture at [December 31, 2007].”', 'B', 'Decision', 'On August 17, 2010, the trial justice issued a lengthy written decision in which he granted an absolute divorce to both parties on the ground of “irreconcilable differences between the parties which have caused the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.” He awarded the parties joint custody of Lucas, with primary physical placement with Hope and regular luncheons and other reasonable visitations with James.', 'The trial justice then addressed the equitable assignment of the marital property. First, he addressed the assets—with the exception of Microfibres and MPL—that the parties had stipulated were marital property. These assets included three homes and their contents, two vacant lots, two automobiles, three country club and golf club memberships, certain jewelry, and various bank accounts and investment accounts that totaled more than $16 million. Before distributing the property, the trial justice examined each factor set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5- 16.1(a). 3 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a), entitled “Assignment of property,” provides:', '“In addition to or in lieu of an order to pay spousal support made', 'pursuant to a complaint for divorce, the court may assign to either', '-5-', 'The trial justice found that the parties had been married on February 14, 1989 and separated in April 2005, and that, despite some “aggravating” and “hurtful” conduct by both parties, neither one was at fault for the breakdown of the marriage. He then addressed “the contribution of each of the parties during the marriage [in] the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.” He found that early in the marriage, Hope contributed to the couple’s income from her “minimal employment” and her rental property; however, he then observed that:', '“It [wa]s clear and unequivocal that [James] was the primary', 'source of the significant wealth that was accumulated during this', 'marriage. It was [James]’s employment in the family business that', 'made it possible for this family to develop the estate * * *.', 'Likewise, it was [James] who managed the family’s investment', 'the husband or wife a portion of the estate of the other. In', 'determining the nature and value of the property, if any, to be', 'assigned, the court after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party', 'shall consider the following:', '“(1) The length of the marriage;', '“(2) The conduct of the parties during the marriage;', '“(3) The contribution of each of the parties during the marriage', 'in the acquisition, preservation, or appreciation in value of their', 'respective estates;', '“(4) The contribution and services of either party as a', 'homemaker;', '“(5) The health and age of the parties;', '“(6) The amount and sources of income of each of the parties;', '“(7) The occupation and employability of each of the parties;', '“(8) The opportunity of each party for future acquisition of', 'capital assets and income;', '“(9) The contribution by one party to the education, training,', 'licensure, business, or increased earning power of the other;', '“(10) The need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the', 'marital residence and to use or own its household effects taking', 'into account the best interests of the children of the marriage;', '“(11) Either party’s wasteful dissipation of assets or any', 'transfer or encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of', 'divorce without fair consideration; and', '“(12) Any factor which the court shall expressly find to be just', 'and proper.”', '-6-', 'accounts to the successful point that ha[d] been achieved,', 'notwithstanding the difficult market.”', 'The trial justice then considered “[t]he contribution and services of either party as a homemaker.” He found that Hope “played the role primarily of homemaker,” but that James “provided [her] with either a [n]anny, or household help, or both, in order to reduce the homemaker’s responsibilities.” Furthermore, James “did most of the family cooking when he was home” and “he contributed to the care of the children.” Moving to the next statutory factor, the trial justice found that Hope was in “good health,” but that James suffered from some physical or emotional malady and that he had had health issues with his back and his hip.', 'As to the next factor, he found that Hope derived income from personal investments, as well as from support provided by James; he also found that James’s income consisted of his salary and distributions from Microfibres. Regarding the occupations and employability of the parties, the trial justice found that Hope had not been part of the work force for twenty years and that James was currently employed as the chief executive of Microfibres. He concluded that both parties would be in a position to acquire further assets and income, based on the substantial amount of assets that they currently owned. He also found that “[n]either party contributed materially to the education, training, or licensure of the other”; however, James “certainly ha[d] placed [Hope] in the position of increasing her earning power by reason of his contributions of assets to the marital estate to which she [wa]s a beneficiary.”', 'The trial justice found that the tenth statutory factor—[t]he need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the marital residence—“[wa]s not material in this case” because there were two domiciles. Finally, he found that there was no wasteful dissipation of assets or any transfer or encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of divorce without fair consideration.', '-7-', 'After reviewing each of the statutory factors, the trial justice awarded each party 50 percent of their bank and investment accounts and 50 percent of one of the country club memberships. He assigned Hope one home and its contents, both automobiles that were in her possession, and all the jewelry that was in her possession. He assigned James the remaining two homes and their contents, the two vacant lots, the remaining golf club membership and country club membership, as well as the jewelry that was in his possession.', 'The trial justice then addressed the knotty issue of the equitable distribution of Microfibres and MPL. Echoing his holding from April 28, 2008 on Hope’s motion for partial summary judgment, the trial justice declared that the stock in Microfibres—all of which stood in James’s name—was a marital asset. He also found that only 49.9967 percent of MPL was marital property, because the remainder had been either acquired by James before the marriage or had been gifted to him. 4 See § 15-5-16.1(b) (“The court may not assign property or an interest in property held in the name of one of the parties if the property was held by the party prior to the marriage[.] * * * The court shall not assign property * * * which has been transferred to one of the parties by gift * * *.”).', 'After an extensive review of the expert testimony in the case, and relying on the October 17, 2008 consent order, the trial justice decided to order an in-kind distribution of the stock of Microfibres and an in-kind distribution of a partnership interest in MPL, instead of valuing the companies and assigning a portion of that value to each party. He found that he “d[id] not have before [him] any probative or credible evidence upon which to base a fair and reasonable valuation of the value of the stock in th[e] corporation,” because “since [December 31, 2007], there ha[d], in fact, been an extraordinary change in circumstances that could not have been 4', 'Microfibres owned a 10 percent interest in MPL and, therefore, that portion was accounted for when the trial justice distributed Microfibres.', '-8- contemplated by the parties.” The extraordinary change in circumstances included, the trial justice asserted, “structural changes in the world economy” caused by “a meltdown in the financial market.” That economic crisis, coupled with the fact that “[t]he ‘China Venture’ had not been finalized,” and the fact that “[n]one of the experts had given any detailed consideration to the potential impact of” that venture, led the trial justice to conclude that he was unable to accurately value Microfibres and MPL. For these reasons, the trial justice determined that “[t]he only fair and equitable method of assigning to [Hope] a portion of the corporate assets would be by assigning to her a portion of the corporate stock,” instead of a sum in cash.', 'In deciding what percentage of that stock to award to Hope, the trial justice found that Hope', '“made little or no contribution to [Microfibres or MPL]. It was a', 'family business in the family of [James] for multiple generations. *', '* * Notwithstanding th[e] finding [that Microfibres was a marital', 'asset], [Hope] ha[d] in no significant way done anything to', 'contribute towards the acquisition, preservation or appreciation of', 'the corporate assets.” He found that “she may have done some decoration at [a] property owned by the corporation,” but that “that essentially [wa]s the limit of her contribution.” The trial justice “acknowledge[d] that she served as a homemaker and as such [wa]s entitled to a share of the marital assets which include[d] Microfibres.” However, he held “that it would be completely inequitable for her to receive a portion of the share in Microfibres, Inc. equal to that of [James] whose blood, sweat and tears and contributions by his family ha[d] been the reason for both the past success and what hopefully w[ould] be the future success of this corporation.” Based on these findings, and relying on the factors enumerated in § 15-5-16.1, the trial justice awarded Hope 25 percent of the stock in Microfibres and 25 percent of that portion of MPL that he had determined to be marital property. James received 75 percent of those two assets.', '-9-', 'Next, the trial justice addressed the issue of alimony. He examined the statutory factors set forth in § 15-5-16 and reincorporated his previous findings from his equitable distribution analysis. He also emphasized the great wealth that the parties enjoyed and specifically found that “[t]he totality of [Hope]’s estate weighs heavily upon this [c]ourt in its determination as to whether or not alimony is justified in this case.” Given Hope’s assets and the language of § 15- 5-16(c)(2)—which provides that “[a]limony is designed to provide support for a spouse for a reasonable length of time to enable the recipient to become financially independent and self- sufficient”—the trial justice denied her request for alimony.', 'The trial justice then addressed the issue of child support for Lucas. After considering the statutory factors enumerated in § 15-5-16.2, the child support guidelines set forth in Family Court Administrative Order 2007-07, and the evidence of the parties’ incomes and Hope’s expenses associated with raising Lucas, the trial justice ordered James to pay Hope $1,000 per week. He also ordered James to pay all expenses reasonably connected with Lucas’s education, summer camp, vacations with James, and all medical and dental expenses.', 'Finally, the trial justice denied Hope’s request for fees, citing to this Court’s opinion in Thompson v. Thompson, 642 A.2d 1160 (R.I. 1994), in which we held that “before awarding counsel fees, the trial justice must determine that the party seeking the award is without funds or property available to pay the fees * * *.” Id. at 1165 (quoting Stevenson v. Stevenson, 511 A.2d 961, 967 n.6 (R.I. 1986)). Because Hope was in possession of substantial assets, including those awarded to her in the equitable distribution of the marital estate, the trial justice denied her request for counsel, expert witness, and other fees. On October 1, 2010, Hope filed a notice of appeal, and on October 20, 2010, James filed a conditional and protective cross-appeal. The two appeals were consolidated by this Court.', '- 10 -', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]he trial justice is accorded broad discretion with respect to the equitable distribution of marital assets; consequently, we will not overturn the trial justice’s distribution unless it is demonstrated that he or she has abused his or her discretion.” Tondreault v. Tondreault, 966 A.2d 654, 659 (R.I. 2009) (quoting DeAngelis v. DeAngelis, 923 A.2d 1274, 1277 (R.I. 2007)). “As long as the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive relevant and material evidence, and as long as he or she considered the requisite statutory elements set forth in § 15-5-16.1, we will not disturb the trial justice’s assignment of property.” Tondreault, 966 A.2d at 659. Furthermore, it is well established that this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s credibility determinations or findings “of fact in a divorce action ‘unless he or she has misconceived the relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” Id. at 660 (quoting DeAngelis, 923 A.2d at 1277). “However, when this Court reviews questions of law in an appeal from the Family Court, ‘we must apply a de novo review.’” Curry v.

We shall address each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Equitable Distribution', 'It is well settled that “[t]he equitable distribution of property in a divorce action involves three steps: (1) determining which assets are marital property; (2) considering the factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a); and (3) distributing the property.” Tondreault, 966 A.2d at 662 (quoting DeAngelis, 923 A.2d at 1277). With this established procedure in mind, we will first address Hope’s argument about the percentage of MPL that should properly be considered to be marital property.', '1', 'The Percentage of MPL that is Marital Property', 'Hope presents a two-fold argument with respect to MPL: She contends that the trial justice did not make sufficient factual finding to support his determination that James acquired 20 percent of MPL before the marriage, and she also asserts that he erred when he found that 20.0033 percent of MPL was gifted to James by his father. 5 James responds by arguing that the trial justice’s findings were sufficient to support his ruling that the disputed portions of MPL either were acquired before the marriage or were gifted to him and, furthermore, that there is an adequate foundation in the record to support those findings. 5', 'Hope also argues that the trial justice erred by not placing a value on MPL before distributing the marital assets; however, we shall address this argument together with her similar contention regarding the need to value Microfibres.', '- 13 -', 'It is undisputed that 10 percent of MPL is owned by Microfibres, and James concedes that 49.9967 percent of MPL is marital property. Therefore, it is the remaining 40.0033 percent of the company that is at issue. In his decision, the trial justice found that:', '“The uncontradicted evidence shows that with respect to the', 'partnership, MPL, a portion of [James]’s interest was gifted to him', 'by his father. That portion was 20.0033%. The Court finds that', 'that portion gifted to [James] is not assignable under Section 15-5-', '16.1, as it is not legally a marital asset. [Additionally, James]', 'claims that 20% of MPL was owned by him prior to the marriage.', 'The Court can certainly award as marital assets in accordance with', 'the statute, any appreciation of the value of that 20% after the date', 'of marriage. However, there is no such evidence to show', 'appreciation of that prior 20%. [James] has stipulated that', '49.9967% of MPL is a marital asset. Therefore, the Court will', 'assign to [Hope] 25% of the 49.9967% of MPL, as it is clearly', 'assignable under Section 15-5-16.1[.]”', 'From the above-quoted portion of the decision, it is clear to us that the trial justice concluded that James owned 20 percent of MPL before the marriage, and certainly the record supports this finding. On June 10, 2008, James testified that he had a 20 percent interest in MPL and that he acquired it prior to the marriage. Although the trial justice’s finding with respect to that 20 percent interest was perhaps not as explicit as it could have been, it is clear from the context of the trial justice’s remarks that he chose to accept James’s testimony and that the 20 percent in dispute was owned by James prior to the marriage and, therefore, was not part of the marital estate. We hold that there was no error in this finding.', 'Additionally, the record contains three documents, labeled as deeds of gift, which, taken together, evidence a transfer of a 20.0033 percent interest in MPL from James’s father, Norman E. McCulloch, Jr. (Norman), to James, without consideration. The record is devoid of anything that would belie that these transfers were gifts. See Ruffel v. Ruffel, 900 A.2d 1178, 1189 (R.I. 2006) (“The elements of a valid gift are a ‘present true donative intent on the part of the donor,’', '- 14 - and ‘some manifestation such as an actual or symbolic delivery of the subject of the gift so as to completely divest the donor of dominion and control of it.’” quoting Black v. Wiesner, 112 R.I. 261, 267, 308 A.2d 511, 515 (1973)). Therefore, the trial justice did not err when he found that this 20.0033 percent interest in MPL was gifted to James by his father, and thus, it was not marital property. Accordingly, we see no error in the trial justice’s determination that the entire contested portion of MPL was not marital property.', '2', 'The Valuation of Microfibres and MPL', 'Hope’s next argument is that the trial justice abused his discretion when he assigned to her a percentage of Microfibres and MPL without first placing a value on those assets. She contends that this was error because: (1) § 15-5-16.1 requires that a value be placed on all marital property, and (2) the trial justice could not have determined whether the distribution was equitable without first assigning a value to the property.', 'James counters by arguing that, in Rhode Island, a valuation of marital property prior to distribution is not required as a matter of law.', 'Section 15-5-16.1(a), entitled “Assignment of property”, provides that:', '“In addition to or in lieu of an order to pay spousal support', 'made pursuant to a complaint for divorce, the court may assign to', 'either the husband or wife a portion of the estate of the other. In', 'determining the nature and value of the property, if any, to be', 'assigned, the court after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party', 'shall consider the following [twelve factors] * * *.” (Emphasis', 'added.) Hope argues that the phrase “[i]n determining the nature and value of the property” creates a statutory obligation that requires a trial justice to measure the worth of all marital property before he or she assigns it. Id. (emphasis added). However, in our opinion, this phrase does not create', '- 15 - such a command. This Court has never held that a trial justice is required to value all marital property before he or she distributes it.', 'Indeed, we have endorsed a trial justice’s distribution of a marital estate in the absence of placing a value on some of the property. In Tondreault, 966 A.2d at 664, the trial justice “was unable * * * to specify the values of the[ IRA] accounts cited by the husband because they had not been provided by the parties.” Nonetheless, this Court held that,', '“[g]iven their control over their respective records, it was', 'reasonable to expect that the parties could, between themselves,', 'determine these appreciation values. Furthermore, the exact values', 'of each marital asset were of little consequence to the trial justice’s', 'decision because the trial justice distributed each marital asset by', 'percentage to each party rather than by totaling the values of all', 'assets and making an assignment based on the sum value of the', 'marital estate.” Id. Therefore, we held that “[t]here was no error,” and we affirmed the trial justice’s distribution of the IRA accounts. Id.', 'To support her position, Hope cites Curry, 987 A.2d at 246-47, and Gervais v. Gervais, 735 A.2d 214, 214 (R.I. 1999) (mem.). However, these cases do not address the issue of whether a trial justice must value all the property in a marital estate; instead, they deal merely with the time as of which the marital property should be valued. Curry, 987 A.2d at 246 (“[M]arital assets should be valued as of the date of trial unless there are compelling circumstances warranting a deviation.” quoting Gervais, 735 A.2d at 214); Gervais, 735 A.2d 214 (deciding whether “the trial justice erred in refusing to make additional findings of fact to support the valuation of the marital estate at a date other than the date of judgment” (emphasis added)). Therefore, we are not persuaded that we should adopt a bright-line, per se rule that would require a trial justice to place a value on all marital property before he or she distributes it.', '- 16 -', 'Nonetheless, in this case, it is our opinion that there was an abuse of discretion when the trial justice declined to value Microfibres and MPL before assigning them. This is so, in part, because those assets constitute such an enormous portion of the marital estate. The experts engaged by the parties valued the companies as of December 31, 2007, at between $106 million and $126 million. Although the values of these companies may have fluctuated since that date, it cannot be gainsaid that Microfibres and MPL compose the vast majority of the marital estate.', 'More importantly, the trial justice’s decision not to place a value on the specific portions of Microfibres and MPL that he assigned to the parties also constituted an abuse of discretion, because he assigned the parties unequal percentages, thereby rendering Hope a minority shareholder of a closely held corporation. Without knowing the values of the portions of the companies that he assigned to each party, we are unable to review whether the entire distribution was equitable.', 'We recognize, as did the trial justice, that an assignment of stock in a closely held corporation, which makes one spouse a minority shareholder, is generally disfavored and should be avoided whenever possible. See Robbins v. Robbins, 549 So. 2d 1033-34 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (“Such a financial arrangement is intolerable, * * * and places the spouse without any real control over the closely held corporation at a distinct disadvantage to the spouse who runs the business.”); Josephson v. Josephson, 772 P.2d 1236, 1243 (Idaho Ct. App. 1989) (holding that a distribution of “stock in a closely held corporation, with majority control in one spouse and with virtually no public market for the stock * * * does little to completely separate the parties and their property”); Savage v. Savage, 658 P.2d 1201, 1205 (Utah 1983) (“[W]henever possible, continued joint ownership by divorced spouses of closely held corporate stock should be avoided', '- 17 - * * *.”); see also Stephen W. Schlissel, The Hazards of “In-Kind” Distributions of Closely-Held Stock in Divorce Actions, 17 J. Am. Acad. Matrim. Law. 381 (2001).', 'Although we do not hold that it is always error to distribute the stock in a closely held corporation such that one spouse is rendered a minority shareholder, it was, in our opinion, error in this case not to value the ownership interests that were assigned to each party. Here, the trial justice assigned Hope 25 percent of Microfibres and MPL; however, a 25 percent, minority share of a closely held corporation will likely not be the equivalent of 25 percent of the total value of the company. First, this is true because stock in a closely held corporation, which is not publicly traded, lacks liquidity because there is no established public market for the stock. See 18A Am. Jur. 2d Corporations § 373 at 247 (2004). Second, a minority shareholder lacks control over the company, and therefore, the value of his or her stock is diluted in comparison to that of a majority shareholder. See id. at 248.', 'Although, this Court has “adopt[ed] the rule of not applying [a minority discount or] a discount for lack of marketability” in the context of an action for dissolution of a closely held corporation, we believe that such discounts are appropriate, and even necessary, when valuing an in-kind distribution of a minority share of a closely held corporation in a divorce action. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 774 (R.I. 2000) (quoting Charland v. Country View Golf Club, Inc., 588 A.2d 609, 613 (R.I. 1991)). The reason that these discounts are not applied “when a corporation elects to buy out a shareholder who has filed for dissolution” is that “[m]inority shareholders should not receive less than [fair market] value if, instead of fighting the dissolution action, the majority decides to * * * buy out the minority * * *.” Charland, 588 A.2d at 613 (quoting Robert B. Heglar, Rejecting the Minority Discount, 1989 Duke L.J. 258, 269 n.63 (1989)). Thus, in those situations, the corporation itself is a willing', '- 18 - buyer, and the rule against applying a minority discount is imposed only to protect the minority shareholder who is bringing the action.', 'In this case, however, if the trial justice were to assign Hope an in-kind, minority share of Microfibres and MPL, Hope would be assigned illiquid assets that have no ready market, and she would be left with no control over the companies. Thus, both a minority discount and a marketability or illiquidity discount must be applied when valuing the portions of the companies that will be assigned to each party. However, if the trial justice had awarded Hope the cash equivalent of her equitable ownership interest in the companies, or if he had crafted some other assignment, such discounts would not be necessary. See Josephson, 772 P.2d at 1244 (holding that “such discounting will not be applicable here when the magistrate awards all shares to [one spouse] and orders compensation or an offsetting award of other property to [the other spouse]”).', 'It is not lost on us that Microfibres and MPL comprise an enormous portion of the marital estate. In view of this fact, and because the trial justice assigned to Hope an in-kind, minority share of the two entities, it is our opinion that the trial justice was required to place a value on those companies. Moreover, he should have placed a value on the portions of the two entities that he assigned to each party to ensure that his distribution of the marital estate was truly equitable.', 'Finally, because we are satisfied that this case required these value determinations, we decline to address Hope’s contention that an assignment of only 25 percent of Microfibres and MPL to her was inequitable and, thus, an abuse of discretion. Because we are unable to review', '- 19 - the value of the 25 percent assignment in comparison to the remainder of the marital estate, we are unable to determine whether this assignment to her was equitable. 6', '3', 'The Consent Order', 'Hope also argues that the trial justice erred when he, sua sponte, disregarded the October 17, 2008 consent order, in which the parties had agreed to a valuation date for the marital property. James contends that the terms of the consent order permitted the trial justice to find that there was a change in circumstances that rendered the valuation date obsolete and that the trial justice correctly found that a change in circumstances had, in fact, occurred based on the experts’ testimony concerning the worldwide economic crisis and the unknown value of the China venture.', 'Although Hope argues that the trial justice’s decision to disregard the agreed-upon valuation date was sua sponte , this contention is not entirely accurate, despite the unconventional manner in which the trial justice made his decision, which we shall briefly recount. On April 9, 2009, James submitted his posttrial memorandum, in which he argued that, based on the experts’ testimony, the trial justice could not reasonably place a value on Microfibres because of the “unforeseeable and dramatic downturn” in the worldwide economy that occurred after the 6', 'Also, because we are unable to fully review the distribution of the marital estate, we decline to pass on Hope’s arguments about alimony and child support at this time, because those analyses may depend on the trial justice’s assignment of marital property on remand. See Marsocci v. Marsocci, 911 A.2d 690, 699-700 (R.I. 2006) (declining to reach the issue of child support until the trial justice performed a valuation and equitable distribution); Ruffel v. Ruffel, 900 A.2d 1178, 1193 (R.I. 2006) (“[T]he proper amount to award for alimony, if any, will depend on the ultimate distribution of the marital estate by the Family Court on remand * * *.”). Furthermore, on June 18, 2013, Lucas turned nineteen years old, thus, in all likelihood, rendering any issue concerning child support moot. See § 15-5-16.2(b) (“The court may, if in its discretion it deems it necessary or advisable, order child support * * *, but in no case beyond [a child’s] nineteenth (19th) birthday.”).', '- 20 - valuation date contained in the consent order.', 'Further, James argued in his posttrial memorandum “that the current economic crisis, or structural change in the world economy, [wa]s an extraordinary circumstance that was not anticipated by the parties.” Thus, James argued that the “arbitrary valuation date” contained in the consent order should no longer be utilized by the parties. Some four months later, on August 7, 2009, while the trial justice was conducting a hearing on an unrelated motion, he informed the parties of his intent to order a revaluation of Microfibres as of a more current date.', 'In response, on August 21, 2009, Hope filed an “objection to and motion for reconsideration of” the trial justice’s decision to revalue the company. On August 27, 2009, the trial justice held a hearing on Hope’s motion to reconsider; however, he denied that motion and he ordered that the two companies be revalued as of September 1, 2009. Then, on January 19, 2010, the trial justice ordered the parties to suspend their revaluation efforts, because he had decided to equitably distribute the stock of the companies without placing a value on them.', 'In the past, this Court has held that “[a] stipulation entered into with the assent of counsel and their clients, relative to an evidentiary fact or an element of a claim, is conclusive upon the parties and removes the issue from the controversy,” and therefore, “[i]t is no longer a question for consideration by the tribunal.” In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d 877, 881-82 (R.I. 2002). Furthermore, we have held that “[a]n order consented to by the parties can not be ‘opened, changed or set aside without the assent of the parties in the absence of fraud, mutual mistake or actual absence of consent[.]’” Id. at 882 (quoting Douglas Construction and Supply Corp. v. Wholesale Center of North Main Street, Inc., 119 R.I. 449, 452, 379 A.2d 917, 918 (1977)).', '- 21 -', 'In this case, the parties entered into a consent order—that was agreed to by the parties and their counsel—which established the valuation date for the marital property. As a result, in the usual case, this valuation date would “no longer [be] a question for consideration by the tribunal.” In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d at 882. However, in this case, paragraph thirty-three of the consent agreement expressly allows either party to challenge the valuation date based on a change in circumstances, if the trial justice finds that it is “an extraordinary change in circumstances that could not have been contemplated by the parties.”', 'Although James arguably challenged the agreed-upon valuation date in his posttrial memorandum, and the trial justice did hold a hearing—albeit after rendering his decision on that specific issue—we believe that the manner in which the trial justice made his decision to disregard the valuation date was error, given the sanctity that our law confers upon consent orders. See In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d at 881-82. First, the hearing was held on Hope’s motion to reconsider—not James’s challenge—and it did not occur until after the trial justice had already informed the parties that he intended to establish a new valuation date. Furthermore, even the trial justice at one point described his decision to order a revaluation of the companies as “sua sponte,” which indicates that he was not ruling on James’s challenge, but rather, that he had decided on his own that the agreed-upon valuation date should be abandoned. Indeed, at the hearing on Hope’s motion to reconsider, the trial justice never mentioned James’s posttrial challenge to the valuation date. Therefore, the manner in which the trial justice deviated from the terms of the consent order—to which the parties had agreed, and which the trial justice himself had earlier approved—constituted error.', 'Although it would have been more appropriate for the trial justice to have explicitly ruled on James’s challenge to the valuation date, and, more importantly, to have held a hearing before', '- 22 - making this ruling, we nonetheless cannot say that this error, on its own, requires that the matter be remanded for a rehearing. We see little to be gained by holding the parties to a valuation date of five-and-a-half years ago, and, after a thorough review of the record, we do not believe that remanding the matter for a proper hearing on James’s challenge to the valuation date will, in any way, change the trial justice’s decision to depart from the date contained in the consent order. 7 However, because the trial justice erred when he declined to value his assignments of Microfibres and MPL, as discussed in the previous section of this opinion, we remand this case for a trial to determine those values, as of the date of that trial, unless the parties reach a new agreement regarding a valuation date. See Curry, 987 A.2d at 246 (holding that “marital assets should be valued as of the date of trial” quoting Gervais, 735 A.2d at 214); see also Esposito v. Esposito, 38 A.3d 1, 6 (R.I. 2012) (“Parties may make an express agreement to change the terminal date for equitable distribution * * *.” quoting Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1185).', 'B', 'Assessment of Fees', 'In Hope’s next line of argument, she contends that the trial justice erred when he denied her requests for reimbursement of fees for attorneys’, experts, and the court-appointed supervisor for James’s visits with Lucas. First, Hope argues that the trial justice “abused [his] discretion when [he] did not require [James] to reimburse Hope for her legal fees and costs [incurred in her 7', 'Hope asserts that James never gave notice that he was challenging the valuation date based on a change in circumstances, as required by the terms of the consent order. However, on October 17, 2008, the same day that the consent order was entered into, James’s attorneys informed Hope’s attorneys, via email, that they “consider[ed] the current worldwide economic conditions exceptional circumstances that were not in contemplation of the parties at the time of the stipulation concerning the valuation date for [Microfibres], and that such circumstance may have a material impact on the value of [Microfibres], and otherwise.” In our opinion, this email sufficiently “disclosed [the] change of circumstances,” as required by the consent order, and provided Hope with sufficient notice of James’s challenge.', '- 23 - efforts] to establish that [James] did not obtain Microfibres by inheritance in connection with [her] summary judgment motion” concerning whether the company was a marital asset. She contends that she should have been awarded attorneys’ fees associated with that summary judgment motion because James took an “unreasonable and untenable position” “[i]n the face of overwhelming, undisputed evidence” to the contrary. Additionally, she contends that she should have been awarded a portion of her legal fees and costs because James was “recalcitrant in providing discovery in this case.”', 'Generally, in a divorce matter, “[a]n award of attorney’s fees is not punitive in nature but serves to ensure that a spouse who lacks financial stability is still able to secure competent representation in the divorce proceeding.” Thompson, 642 A.2d at 1165. Thus, as the trial justice held, “[i]t is well established that ‘before awarding counsel fees, the trial justice must determine that the party seeking the award is without funds or property available to pay the fees and that the spouse who will be charged with payment of the fees has the financial ability to satisfy the obligation.’” Id. (quoting Stevenson, 511 A.2d at 967 n.6). Here, however, the trial justice found that Hope had “substantial liquid assets,” and, consequently, “ha[d] the ability to compensate her own attorneys.”', 'Before this Court, Hope argues that that holding by the trial justice was an abuse of discretion because her request for attorneys’ fees was not based on her inability to pay, but instead on “[James]’s conduct in this case.” Thus, in reality, Hope is asking this Court to impose a sanction on James by exercising our “inherent power to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 711 n.5 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Vincent v. Musone, 574 A.2d 1234, 1235 (R.I. 1990)). But, as we have held in the past,', '- 24 -', '“[t]his remedy * * * is available only in one of three narrowly', 'defined circumstances: (1) pursuant to the ‘common fund', 'exception’ that ‘allows a court to award attorney’s fees to a party', 'whose litigation efforts directly benefit others[,]’ * * *; (2) ‘as a', 'sanction for the willful disobedience of a court order[,]’ * * *; or', '(3) when a party has ‘acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or', 'for oppressive reasons.’” Id. (quoting Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,', '501 U.S. 32, 45, 45-46 (1991)). Hope does not argue that either of the first two circumstances exist in this case, but only that “[James]’s conduct” during the litigation warrants an award of legal fees. However, in our opinion, Hope has failed to demonstrate that James “acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” Id. (quoting Chambers, 501 U.S. at 45-46). Therefore, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied Hope’s request for attorneys’ fees.', 'Next, Hope argues that the trial justice erred when he denied her request that James be required to reimburse the marital estate for his expert fees and for her legal fees incurred in countering those experts. Hope contends that James should reimburse the marital estate because he later did an about-face and abandoned his experts’ opinions in his posttrial memorandum and, thus, he needlessly squandered marital assets when he hired the experts in the first place. James argues that the trial justice was correct when he denied Hope’s request for expert fees, because the experts did not possess sufficient information to value the China venture and they were hired to opine as to the value of Microfibres before the world economy was thrown into the throes of economic crisis. Therefore, James argues, there should be no basis to sanction him for declining to argue values that he believed were no longer valid or that had lost relevance because of the China venture. We agree.', 'As Jay Fishman—the court-appointed valuation expert—testified, “there ha[d] been a meltdown in the financial market since” the stipulated valuation date. Furthermore, he said that “[b]oth [parties’] experts received insufficient information and, therefore, I received insufficient', '- 25 - information to place a value or an economic benefit on the China venture at [the stipulated valuation date].” Additionally, in his decision, the trial justice said that, after the economic crisis and without sufficient evidence on the China venture, he “d[id] not have before [him] any probative or credible evidence upon which to base a fair and reasonable valuation of the value of the stock in th[e] corporation.” Based on Fishman’s testimony, which the trial justice found to be credible, James should not be required to reimburse the marital estate for his experts’ fees simply because he challenged the efficacy of their valuations at a later date. Furthermore, Hope fails to cite a single case to support her contention that a party in James’s position should be required to reimburse a marital estate after changing his position about his experts’ findings. Therefore, we see no error in the trial justice’s denial of Hope’s request for expert fees.', 'Hope’s last argument regarding fees is that the trial justice abused his discretion when he did not order James to pay her share of the costs of the supervised visits between James and Lucas, because, according to Hope, the supervision was necessary as a result of James’s conduct. However, this argument is not well developed. Hope commits only four sentences to it in her brief. Additionally, she cites no legal authority to support her allegation that the trial justice abused his discretion when he declined to order James to pay those fees.', 'Therefore, she has presented nothing to this Court that would warrant a reversal of the trial justice’s denial of her request. See Bucci, 2013 WL 1498655, at *16 n.17 (“[a] mere passing reference to an argument such as this, without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.” quoting State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007)).', '- 26 -', 'C', 'Will, Trust, and Estate-Planning Documents', 'Hope’s final argument is that the trial justice erred when he denied her request that James disclose information about his will, trusts, and other estate-planning documents. First, she argues that James should have been ordered to disclose these documents because they were relevant to the issue of whether James was unfaithful. James counters by arguing that there is no evidence in the record that suggests that he was unfaithful and, therefore, that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he denied Hope’s request.', 'After a careful review of the record, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion when he refused to order James to disclose his will and estate-planning documents. Hope offers very little reasoning for her argument, other than to say that these documents “were relevant to whether [James] was unfaithful to Hope prior to this divorce being final,” because “[James] refused to disclose [one of] the new beneficiar[ies].” She suggests no other evidence of unfaithfulness, and we can find no such evidence in the record. Therefore, the trial justice was well within his discretion to deny her discovery request for James’s will and other estate- planning documents. See Dawkins, 22 A.3d at 1150 (recognizing a trial justice’s “broad discretion” in ruling on discovery motions (quoting Hindle, 748 A.2d at 259)).', 'Next, Hope argues that the trial justice erred when he denied her motion to compel disclosure of information about James’s trusts; however, we do not believe that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied this motion.', 'On January 19, 2010, the trial justice conducted a hearing on Hope’s motion to compel further discovery of James’s trusts. In denying the motion, the trial justice said that, at that juncture, he had not yet distributed the marital estate and that James had made no indication that he would not be able to comply with any order of', '- 27 - assignment. Therefore, the trial justice held that the requested information concerning James’s trusts would not be relevant until after the assignment of marital property. Likewise, we are of the opinion that any review of the denial of this motion would be premature, because we are vacating, in part, the decision pending entry of final judgment in this case, which will require a new equitable distribution of the marital estate. Accordingly, we decline to address this issue on the merits at this time.', 'Finally, Hope argues that the information about James’s trusts was relevant to the issue of alimony; however, in our opinion, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he denied the motion. In his decision, the trial justice quoted § 15-5-16(c)(2), which provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]limony is designed to provide support for a spouse for a reasonable length of time to enable the recipient to become financially independent and self-sufficient.”', 'He then specifically found that Hope had “sufficient assets and income” such that “an award of alimony would not be justified.” We do not see how ordering the disclosure of additional information about James’s trusts would have, in any way, changed this finding. Therefore, upon review, we discern no error by the trial justice. 8 See Dawkins, 22 A.3d at 1150.', 'D', 'James’s Conditional Cross-appeal', 'After Hope filed her appeal in this case, James filed a protective and conditional cross- appeal, arguing that the trial justice erred when he granted partial summary judgment and found Microfibres to be a marital asset. James avowed that he would not press this issue on appeal if 8', 'Hope further contends that the information about James’s trusts was relevant to the issue of child support. However, on June 18, 2013, Lucas turned nineteen years old, thus, likely rendering any issue concerning child support moot. See § 15-5-16.2(b) (“The court may, if in its discretion it deems it necessary or advisable, order child support * * *, but in no case beyond [a child’s] nineteenth (19th) birthday.”). Therefore, we need not address Hope’s argument about this discovery motion as it relates to child support for Lucas.', '- 28 - this Court affirmed the Family Court’s decision pending entry of final judgment; however, because we now vacate part of that decision, we shall address James’s conditional cross-appeal.', 'In his cross-appeal, James raises two arguments. First, he contends that the trial justice erred when he concluded that an advance on inheritance—which occurred while the transferor was alive—was not a “transfer[] to one of the parties by inheritance” under § 15-5-16.1(b), and, therefore, such an advancement was marital property. 9 Furthermore, James argues that the trial justice erred by deciding a question of fact on summary judgment when he found that James’s acquisition of the stock in Microfibres was not an advance on his inheritance. Assuming, without deciding, that an advance on inheritance should be considered to be a “transfer[] * * * by inheritance” under § 15-5-16.1(b), which would render those assets nonmarital, we hold that there was no genuine issue of material fact that would have precluded summary judgment, and we agree with the trial justice that, as a matter of law, the transfer of Microfibres stock was, in fact, a sale.', 'The transfer of the stock to James was part of a larger recapitalization of the company. On November 15, 1989, James sent an “offer to purchase for $105,000 in cash the 30,000 shares of Common Stock of Microfibres, Inc.” to the trustees of the trust that owned the stock at that time. Then, in a series of letters, the trustees accepted James’s offer to purchase the stock. Additionally, other internal company documents evidence the recapitalization and refer to the transfer of stock to James as a “purchase” and “sale.” 9', 'Section 15-5-16.1(a) provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]n addition to or in lieu of an order to pay spousal support made pursuant to a complaint for divorce, the court may assign to either the husband or wife a portion of the estate of the other,” however, “[t]he court * * * shall not assign property or an interest in property which has been transferred to one of the parties by inheritance before, during, or after the term of the marriage.” Section 15-5-16.1(b).', '- 29 -', 'At the summary judgment hearing, the trial justice held that these documents were “clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous.” He then went on to say:', '“The meaning of the word ‘sale’ and ‘purchase’ have no', 'ambiguity, which would leave room for the [c]ourt to further', 'render interpretation.

There is no issue', 'of fact * * *.”', 'On appeal, James does not dispute the characterization of the “paper transaction”; however, he argues that his and his father’s intent as to whether the transfer of stock was an inheritance was a question of fact that was inappropriately decided on summary judgment.

In his fifty-three page amended complaint, plaintiff named as defendants fifty-three specific individuals. Generally, the named defendants are employees of the ACI or the larger Department of Corrections (DOC) and A.T. Wall. The principal allegations in the amended complaint centered on the following claims: defendants violated plaintiff‟s right to privacy by using a hidden camera located in his prison cell to monitor and videotape plaintiff as he reviewed his “legal work” and “legal mail”; that defendants were monitoring his personal activities; that specific defendants displayed these videotapes to various people; and that defendants regularly harassed plaintiff. 2', 'See Laurence v.

In a bench decision delivered at the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice granted that motion. In her decision, the trial justice found that “a large portion” of the claims were barred by res judicata and, accordingly, she was satisfied that the action must be dismissed pursuant to Rules 12 and 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. An order and a final judgment granting the state‟s motion were entered on August 22, 2011. On appeal of that decision, this Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court after concluding that plaintiff failed to establish an issue of material fact; that his complaint did not contain a short and plain statement of claims pursuant to Rule 8(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; and that plaintiff had been afforded a full and fair hearing on the motion to dismiss.

Along with that complaint, plaintiff filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis. This complaint named thirteen defendants—all employees of the DOC—and alleged violations of his First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiff also asserted that his free speech was being constrained by “the use of physical violence, threats[,] blackmail[,] and extortion[,]” that his rights to the courts were being obstructed, and that he was being harassed because of his legal proceedings.4 4', 'In his complaint, plaintiff alleged many instances of verbal harassment by correctional officers and other prison employees. For instance, plaintiff claimed that various officers and prison employees called plaintiff a child molester and also made comments about his legal work and', '-3-', 'In response, the state filed an objection to plaintiff‟s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and argued that plaintiff had filed “numerous meritless actions” in both state and federal court and that his motion should be denied. The state further averred that plaintiff was abusing the state and the judiciary‟s limited resources. Based on these contentions, defendants asked that plaintiff‟s motion be denied and the case dismissed or, in the alternative, that the court decline to order a waiver of the filing fee. The defendants implored the court “to fashion a remedy to prevent [plaintiff‟s] ongoing, nonstop litigation against the DOC and literally every DOC official and officer.”', 'The motion to proceed in forma pauperis came before the trial justice on August 30, 2011.5 Initially, the trial justice indicated that she was “inclined to grant [plaintiff‟s] motion to proceed in forma pauperis with respect to the filing fees and the transcript fees for the hearing of July 22nd, 2011[, PC 03-6046].” The state responded that it had no objection to that motion for transcript costs “on the appeal of the 2003 case,” but it expressed its intention “to take a very different position with regard to [plaintiff‟s new action, PC 11-4971].”', 'After setting forth the various factors to be considered in a noncriminal matter, including “[t]he need for finality,” the trial justice granted plaintiff‟s motion to proceed in forma pauperis as to the earlier case. When the trial justice turned to the new claim, PC 11-4971, the appeal of which is now before us, the state objected to plaintiff‟s in forma pauperis motion, arguing that plaintiff‟s new complaint comprised “similar allegations to [those] set forth in earlier cases,” civil actions against prison employees. In addition, plaintiff claimed that various individuals were making and viewing videotapes of plaintiff‟s private activities conducted in his cell. The plaintiff concluded his lengthy complaint by repeating his constitutional claims and adding that defendants were guilty of defamation and of painting plaintiff in a false light. Additionally, he alleged that he had been physically assaulted and sexually harassed. 5', 'The plaintiff‟s motion sought permission to proceed in forma pauperis in his appeal in case PC 03-6046 and in the newly filed PC 11-4971.', '-4- including the allegations of interference with plaintiff‟s legal work, harassment and assault by correctional officers, and allegations regarding plaintiff‟s psychiatric report, and it noted that plaintiff had filed a number of “substantially similar cases.” The state asserted that plaintiff‟s case should be screened by the court and, further, that plaintiff should not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis. In the alternative, the state argued that, if the case were allowed to go forward, plaintiff should be required to pay the filing fees from earnings from his prison job and money deposited in his account by people outside of the prison.', 'The state concluded its argument by requesting that plaintiff‟s actions be halted, stating that, “at some point this has to come to an end” and “[a]t some point[,] the [c]ourt has to say enough, Mr. Laurence.”', 'The plaintiff began his response by describing his attempts to write and send letters to attorneys, but “the contents [of his letters were] all over the place” because “correctional officers spread a whole bunch of rumors about lawyers because of what they got from [his] legal work.” At this juncture, the trial justice interposed that she was inclined to deny plaintiff‟s motion; then she laid out her reasoning so that plaintiff could respond to it. The trial justice indicated that plaintiff‟s current action was a civil case, rather than criminal, and she would consider that factor. She also stated that plaintiff‟s pleadings did not comport with the requirements of Rule 8; the complaint, though “very detailed,” was “rambling” and “not concisely pled,” and the trial justice noted that “it was impossible * * * to discern against whom the various aspects of the[] claims [were] being alleged.”6', 'In response, plaintiff requested additional time to amend his complaint. The trial justice asked plaintiff whether his case was “a continuation of the earlier patterns that [he] was alleging 6', 'Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states, in relevant part, that “[a] pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain * * * a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief * * *.”', '-5- in [his] other cases[,]” and plaintiff answered, “Yes, [the case was] for things that have happened in 2000 for three years[,]” and he added that it “ha[d] gone on for a long time.”', 'After this exchange, plaintiff inquired as to whether he would be allowed to proceed with his lawsuit and whether the court could instruct him as to how many pages his complaint could be. The trial justice explained that “[i]t‟s not a question of pages,” but rather that “Rule 8 requires notice pleading, which means that when somebody reads the complaint, whether it‟s long or whether it‟s short, they really understand that they‟re a defendant and what claim specifically is being brought against them * * *.” After explaining that plaintiff‟s complaint was lacking in these regards, the trial justice denied his motion to proceed in forma pauperis and ordered that the clerk not accept any new filings from plaintiff unless he was represented by counsel and further instructed that any pleadings must be signed by counsel in accordance with Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'Two orders entered on August 30, 2011. One order denied plaintiff‟s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and to waive the filing fee in PC 11-4971, and also ordered that the clerk not accept any “new complaint, petition, pleadings, filings or papers” from plaintiff “unless he is represented by counsel” and the papers were signed by counsel pursuant to Rule 11. The other order—captioned “Administrative Order”—prohibited the clerks of the Superior Court from accepting “any pleadings or papers, including, but not limited to, complaints, petitions, motions, requests, claims, and causes of action brought by [plaintiff] or on his behalf unless said pleading or paper is signed by a licensed Rhode Island attorney in accordance with [Rule 11].” Notably, this order was not limited to filings in case PC 11-4971, nor did it exclude criminal cases or cases in which plaintiff might be named as a defendant; the order stated that “[t]he only exception * * * shall be with respect to * * * P.C. 03-6046 * * *.” In conclusion, the order', '-6- directed that papers submitted by plaintiff be retained “[f]or purposes of record keeping only,” but it also instructed that “no such pleadings and papers will be scheduled for hearing and no action shall be taken upon them unless they are signed by a licensed Rhode Island attorney in accordance with [Rule 11].”', 'The plaintiff timely appealed. Together with his appeal, plaintiff filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis for purposes of the filing fees and the availability of transcripts for the appeal. Soon thereafter, the state filed its response to plaintiff‟s motions, noting that it did not object. The record reflects that these motions were granted.', 'Discussion', 'Although plaintiff‟s travel throughout our court system is extensive, we are confronted with only two issues in this appeal. The plaintiff has appealed from (1) the Superior Court justice‟s order denying his motion to proceed in forma pauperis and (2) the administrative order restricting plaintiff‟s ability to proceed pro se in case PC 11-4971. We address these two orders in turn.', 'First, plaintiff has moved for permission to proceed in forma pauperis with his lawsuit. “This [C]ourt has held that „[i]n every instance [when in forma pauperis benefits are sought] the burden of proving indigence in relation to the payment of the required filing fee or other element of cost is upon the party seeking such relief.‟” D‟Amario v. State, 686 A.2d 82, 86 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Silvestro v. Almonte, 484 A.2d 900, 903 (R.I. 1984)). Before this Court, however, plaintiff expressed his willingness to pay the fees associated with that lawsuit. In light of that concession, we deem the issue waived.7 7', 'We note that plaintiff did not file an affidavit of indigency, but rather, in his motion to proceed in forma pauperis, he stated that he owns no property, he has “a prison job” that pays him $60 per month, the federal court “takes 20 percent of [his] earnings,” and he must “buy [his] own', '-7-', 'Second, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred when she granted an order that restricted his ability to proceed as a pro se litigant in virtually any cases in our courts. For its part, the state argues that the trial justice‟s order was appropriate, citing this Court‟s opinion in State v. D‟Amario, 725 A.2d 276, 280-81 (R.I. 1999), in support of its proposition that a litigant‟s access to the courts may indeed be limited to preserve the courts‟ resources. After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice erred when she directed the entry of this order.', 'Our decision in Cok v. Read, 770 A.2d 441 (R.I. 2001), is instructive. In Cok, we addressed the appropriateness of an order that “barred [a party] from appearing pro se as a plaintiff in any actions in the Rhode Island Superior Court for one year[,]” “exclud[ing] all criminal matters” and “cases in which [a] plaintiff might appear as a defendant.” Id. at 443. We remarked that “courts have limited resources and that relentless, frivolous filings constitute unreasonable demands on those resources.” Id. at 443-44 (quoting D‟Amario, 725 A.2d at 281). Further, this Court observed that while “courts may place „reasonable limits on the filings of litigants who abuse the judicial system[,] * * * such a sanction should be drawn narrowly.‟” Id. at 444 (quoting D‟Amario, 725 A.2d at 281). Indeed, “[i]f an injunction against future litigation were couched in overly broad terms, this could impermissibly infringe upon a litigator‟s right of access to the courts.” Cok, 770 A.2d at 444 (quoting Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993)). Accordingly, we directed that “broad filing restrictions against pro se plaintiffs „should be approached with particular caution.‟” Id. (quoting Cok, 985 F.2d at 35); see also Pavilonis v. King, 626 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir. 1980). clothes[,] stamps, cop[ies,] and case law if the library [does not] have it.” Nonetheless, because plaintiff has indicated his willingness to cover court costs, we need not pass upon this issue.', '-8-', 'In fact, this Court carefully instructed that “[a]cross the board restrictions to court access „should be issued only when abuse is so continuous and widespread as to suggest no reasonable alternative,‟” Cok, 770 A.2d at 444 (quoting Cok, 985 F.2d at 36), and “[n]ot only must an order restraining the filing of civil actions have a narrowness of scope, but it also must be supported by specific findings.” Id. (quoting Lembo v. Cranshaw, 736 A.2d 88, 89 (R.I. 1999) (mem.)). In addition, we indicated that, “[b]ecause of the breadth of a ban on all civil actions, a court must „develop a record showing such widespread abuse of the judicial system as to warrant such a broadcast prohibition.‟” Id. (quoting Lembo, 736 A.2d at 89-90). This Court also determined that “a party subject to such restriction against the filing of civil actions should be given notice of the contemplated sanction and an opportunity to present evidence in opposition to the proposed sanction.” Id. (quoting Lembo, 736 A.2d at 90). Notwithstanding the need for procedural protections, in D‟Amario, 725 A.2d at 280-81, 281, we pointed to several holdings of the United States Supreme Court that “justif[ied] the placing of reasonable limits on the filings of litigants who abuse the judicial system” and similarly declared that “the right at issue [in D‟Amario] [was] not so fundamental as to be completely unwaivable in certain instances.”', 'In the case at bar, the order limiting plaintiff‟s access to the court is overly broad; it is tantamount to a lifetime ban on the Superior Court‟s acceptance of any pro se filing by plaintiff—excepting those related to the instant appeals—and fails to exclude criminal cases or those matters in which plaintiff may appear as a defendant. Critically, the order fails to recite any findings of fact, nor does it appear that plaintiff was afforded notice or an adequate opportunity to be heard before it was entered. Furthermore, we are not convinced that the record in this case reflects a degree of “abuse [that] is so continuous and widespread as to suggest no reasonable alternative.” Cok, 770 A.2d at 444 (quoting Cok, 985 F.2d at 36). It appears that,', '-9- although there may be a multitude of defendants, there is not a multitude of suits. This Court does not dispute the simple truth that plaintiff has been a repeat patron of Rhode Island‟s state and federal courts, and we acknowledge that his filings are numerous, lengthy, and often unclear; but this order—wholly lacking in specific findings—does not show “such widespread abuse of the judicial system as to warrant such a broadcast prohibition.” Id. (quoting Lembo, 736 A.2d at 89-90).', 'In sum, the order does not comport with this Court‟s precedent and fails to include the protections afforded to plaintiff by D‟Amario and Cok. Therefore, we conclude that the order was improperly entered and “impermissibly infringe[s] upon [plaintiff‟s] right of access to the courts.” Cok, 770 A.2d at 444 (quoting Cok, 985 F.2d at 34).', 'We pause to note that, before this Court, the plaintiff stated that life at the ACI has improved since he last availed himself of our courts and that he does not anticipate any additional litigation. Nevertheless, the plaintiff explained that he seeks to preserve his right to pursue a claim in the future, but only if the need to do so arises. We take the plaintiff at his word that he has no current intention to pursue further litigation of civil claims that clearly are barred by res judicata.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the orders restricting the plaintiff from filing any pro se actions in Superior Court are vacated.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 3, 2009, Thornton filed several pro se motions in the Superior Court, including a motion to dismiss or vacate count 3 of the indictment; a motion to vacate the consecutive sentence imposed; and a motion for discovery and inspection of victim-impact statements from 1996 and 1997. Thornton also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, motions to assign the matters for a hearing and status conference, a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and a motion to appoint counsel. About three months later, on October 30, 2009, Thornton filed further motions and supporting materials: a motion to correct an illegal sentence; a motion to reopen for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence; and a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss or vacate.', 'The motions filed in August and October 2009 set forth two grounds for relief. First, Thornton contended that his conviction on both count 3 (assault with a dangerous weapon) and count 5 (felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury) violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Second, he argued that the prosecutor had violated Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to produce certain victim-impact statements in response to his discovery requests.', 'Counsel was appointed to represent Thornton on October 30, 2009.

Stravato, 935 A.2d 948 (R.I. 2007), which was decided ten years after Thornton was convicted. Counsel wrote that the rule announced in Stravato should not be applied retroactively and therefore should not serve as a basis on which relief could be granted.', 'In a letter to the Superior Court justice who would soon conduct a hearing on Thornton’s claims for relief, Thornton objected to the positions taken by his counsel in the Shatney memorandum. On April 8, 2010, the parties appeared before that hearing justice. At the outset, the hearing justice and Thornton’s counsel agreed that the motions which Thornton had filed in August and October 2009 would be treated as an application for postconviction relief. Thornton’s counsel then briefly reiterated the arguments in his Shatney memorandum. The hearing justice then permitted Thornton to respond.', 'Thornton took issue with his counsel’s conclusion that the prosecution’s failure to produce certain victim-impact statements could not serve as grounds for postconviction relief. He stated, “I am not asking you [the hearing justice] to decide if Stravato applies. I am asking you to decide the [longstanding] case law of the rule of Brady v. Maryland to determine if a Rule memorandum in which counsel “lists each issue the applicant wished to raise, and explains why in [his or her] professional opinion those issues and any others that he or she may have investigated lacked merit.” Id.', '-3- 16 violation occurred.” 3 Thornton contended that Stravato “[did] not create a new rule,” but rather “reinforce[d]” the state’s obligation to comply with Rule 16.', 'Thornton also submitted an affidavit from the attorney who had served as his standby counsel at trial. That attorney confirmed that the state had not produced the victim-impact statements at issue in response to Thornton’s initial discovery request. Additionally, he averred that the state had objected to a subsequent discovery request filed by Thornton and, at a hearing before the trial justice, had stated that it had produced everything required by Brady and Rule 16. The state’s answer to Thornton’s discovery request and Thornton’s subsequent request for discovery were attached to the affidavit.', 'The hearing justice first determined that Thornton’s double jeopardy argument “ha[d] no merit whatsoever,” and, accordingly, he denied relief on this ground. 4 He then heard from the state’s attorney, who confirmed that the state had not given the victim-impact statements to Thornton. The state’s attorney denied that this nondisclosure was deliberate and denied that Thornton had been prejudiced as a result. Another attorney for the state provided details about the victim-impact statements at issue.', 'The first, from Debra Means, was received by the Department of Attorney General on November 13, 1996. The second, from Diane Sullivan, was received on November 20, 1996. Means, the primary victim, was Thornton’s ex-girlfriend. He was convicted of kidnapping and assaulting her, as well as violating a no-contact order imposed 3', 'We discuss Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), in detail below. See part IV-B, infra. 4', 'Because the hearing justice’s conclusion on this issue is manifestly correct, and because Thornton has not meaningfully briefed his objection to it on appeal, we decline to address it. See Rivera v. State, 58 A.3d 171, 179 (R.I. 2013) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.” (quoting Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002)).', '-4- for her protection. Sullivan was not physically injured; she was the victim with respect to the count of witness intimidation.', 'The hearing justice adjourned the hearing, reserved ruling on the motion, and ordered the state to provide Thornton (through counsel) and the court with copies of those statements, which it did. 5 Thornton’s counsel then filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to withdraw. This supplemental Shatney memorandum concluded that Thornton had “suffered no demonstrable procedural prejudice” as a result of the state’s inadvertent nondisclosure of the victim-impact statements and that those statements did not meet Brady’s standard of materiality. The state also filed a memorandum in which it urged the court to reject Thornton’s arguments.', 'Another hearing on this matter was held on September 27, 2010. The hearing justice asked Thornton to explain how he could have used the information contained in the victim- impact statements if those statements had been disclosed to him before trial. Thornton initially responded that he “would have been able to confer with [standby] counsel to determine [how to utilize the statements] * * *.” He speculated that the statements could have led to medical records that might have contained impeachment evidence. He elaborated as follows: “* * * I believe that [Means] may have * * * disclosed in her counseling session[s] some things that may not have been said at trial. * * * [F]or instance, she could [have said] that she was not extremely affected under the circumstances * * *.” When Thornton stated that Sullivan “made accusations in the victim[-]impact statement that [he felt he] could have challenged,” the hearing justice asked him to be more specific. Thornton responded, “[t]he entire content of it. * * * I could 5', 'The state’s supplemental answer to Thornton’s discovery request indicates that it was filed in open court on May 8, 2010. This appears to be an error because, although a hearing took place on April 8, 2010, no further hearings were held until September 27, 2010. The supplemental Shatney memorandum indicates that the state produced the victim-impact statements on April 8, 2010.', '-5- have used * * * the whole entire content [of Means’s and Sullivan’s statements] to determine how I wanted to approach the witness[es] through cross-examination.”', 'The hearing justice continued the matter once again to ensure that the state had, in fact, given Thornton each and every victim-impact statement in its possession. On October 21, 2010, the hearing justice filed a written decision, denying Thornton’s claim for relief. At the outset, the hearing justice stated that “Thornton ha[d] abandoned any claims under Stravato.” He concluded that Thornton was not entitled to a new trial based on Brady “because the information in the victim[-]impact statements was either immaterial or already provided in discovery.” He found that the statements provided “neither exculpatory nor impeachment evidence.” He also observed that the statements had been filed with the court and were thus “readily available to both Thornton * * * and his standby counsel.” Accordingly, the hearing justice concluded that Thornton was not entitled to a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 6', 'In an order entered on October 27, 2010, Thornton’s postconviction counsel was granted permission to withdraw. Thornton filed a pro se notice of appeal of the Superior Court’s decision on November 8, 2010. By order dated November 9, 2012, this Court remanded the case for entry of final judgment, which occurred on November 30, 2012. 7 6', 'On appeal, the state notes that, “[b]ecause Thornton filed his [motions] concerning the victim[- ]impact statements well over three years after judgment was entered against him in the criminal case, technically the hearing justice should not have handled the matter under Rule 33 [of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure] at all.” We agree. However, as the state concedes, “the standard for obtaining a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is the same under Rule 33 as it is in the [postconviction-relief] context, see, e.g., Ferrell v. Wall, 889 A.2d 177, 184 (R.I. 2005).” 7', 'We treat Thornton’s appeal as timely even though it preceded the Superior Court’s entry of final judgment. See State v. Lamoureux, 58 A.3d 189, 192 n.4 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Delarosa, 39 A.3d 1043, 1049 n.12 (R.I. 2012)).', '-6-', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The issue presented for our decision is straightforward—did the hearing justice err in finding that Thornton was not entitled to postconviction relief based on the prosecution’s failure to disclose certain victim-impact statements? 8 Thornton maintains that he is entitled to a new trial based on the state’s violation of Rule 16 and Brady. The state contends that Thornton’s claim is not only barred by res judicata, but also is meritless. Furthermore, the state argues that Thornton has not satisfied the test set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, which permits the granting of a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Rhode Island’s statutory postconviction remedy is set forth in chapter 9.1 of title 10.

State, 45 A.3d 594, 601 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 16 (R.I. 2012)).

State, 947 A.2d 896, 901 n.7 (R.I. 2008)).', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'Because Thornton claims that he is entitled to postconviction relief based on discovery violations, we first review the pertinent events in the pretrial phase of his prosecution. Thornton was indicted in September 1996. Shortly thereafter, on October 2, 1996, he filed a request for discovery. This request more or less mirrored the provisions of Rule 16; it included a request for prior statements of the prosecution’s expected trial witnesses. The state responded to Thornton’s request on October 21, 1996. This response included police statements from Debra Means and Diane Sullivan; both were dated June 19, 1996.', 'One month after the state responded to Thornton’s discovery request, on November 21, 1996, the state filed with the court copies of signed victim-impact statements that had been completed by Means and Sullivan in connection with requests for information from the Victim Witness Assistance program. About eight months later, on July 30, 1997, the state filed with the court a “Further Victim[-]Impact Statement” by Means. In this statement, dated July 28, 1997, Means reported that she had recently undergone surgery to repair a hernia that developed after Thornton stabbed her. It is undisputed that the state did not formally disclose any of these three victim-impact statements to Thornton.', '-8-', 'On October 9, 1997, Thornton filed a second motion for discovery, which more or less mirrored the first request he had filed one year earlier. 9', 'He also filed a motion for exculpatory evidence on October 23, 1997. The following month, on November 14, 1997, he filed a motion for additional discovery.', 'A pretrial hearing was held on November 26, 1997. The state objected to Thornton’s most recent discovery motions, claiming that it had already responded to the discovery request Thornton had filed in October 1996. The hearing justice stated that he was “satisfied the [s]tate ha[d] complied pursuant to Brady and Rule 16,” and he denied Thornton’s request for further discovery. The case then proceeded to trial.', 'Years later, on August 3, 2009, Thornton filed a pro se motion for discovery and inspection of victim-impact statements from 1996 and 1997. During the ensuing postconviction- relief proceedings, the state produced the victim-impact statements on April 8, 2010. Thornton then filed an affidavit, dated April 24, 2010, in which he stated that “this newly discovered evidence [had] never been seen by [him] nor was it ever provided to [him] in discovery before trial.” 10', 'A', 'Res Judicata', '“Section 10-9.1-8, which codifies * * * the doctrine of res judicata within the postconviction-relief context, bars relitigation of the same issues between the same parties after a 9', 'Thornton was represented by counsel when he filed his original request for discovery in October 1996.

Thornton attempted to release appointed counsel on March 13, 1997, but the court did not release his counsel until September 5, 1997. Thornton acted pro se in filing his second motion for discovery, with a third attorney appointed to represent him as standby counsel. 10', 'This affidavit was filed in support of a motion for a new trial and a motion to compel discovery, which Thornton mailed to the clerk of the court on or about April 29, 2010.', '-9- final judgment has entered in a prior proceeding.” Anderson, 45 A.3d at 602 (quoting Brown v.

(quoting Brown, 32 A.3d at 910 and Ferrell v. Wall, 971 A.2d 615, 621 (R.I. 2009)).', 'This appeal centers on the state’s failure to produce the victim-impact statements of Means and Sullivan to Thornton in response to his requests for discovery. Although those statements were not given to Thornton, they were filed with the clerk of the court and noted on the court docket sheet. Because Thornton was represented by counsel on direct appeal and in connection with his first application for postconviction relief, we conclude that he should have been aware through counsel of the existence of these statements. See Anderson, 45 A.3d at 602 (barring claim of prosecutorial misconduct because grounds were available to applicant through counsel when he filed his initial postconviction-relief application). Even if the claims underlying this postconviction-relief application were not barred by res judicata, they are meritless, as we explain below.', 'B', 'Brady', 'In the landmark decision of Brady, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held that “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Id. at 87. In a later decision, the Supreme Court defined the standard of materiality: “[E]vidence is material only if there is a reasonable', '- 10 - probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985). The Bagley court also clarified that “[i]mpeachment evidence * * * falls within the Brady rule.” Id. at 676.', 'We conclude that, even if the state had disclosed the victim-impact statements to him before trial, Thornton has failed to demonstrate that the result of his trial would have been different. See Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. The hearing justice explained his decision on this issue as follows:', '“[T]he information in the victim[-]impact statements was either', 'immaterial or already provided in discovery.

This speculation falls far short of “‘reasonable probability’ * * * sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome” of his trial. See Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. Because Thornton cannot satisfy Bagley’s standard of materiality, his claim under Brady must fail.', '- 11 -', 'C', 'Rule 16', 'In addition to Brady’s mandate, prosecutors must also comply with the discovery obligations set forth in our court rules. Rule 16(a) allows a defendant to seek discovery from the prosecution “[u]pon written request.” Among other things, defendants may seek production of “all written or recorded verbatim statements” of the prosecution’s expected trial witnesses. Rule 16(a)(8). The rule imposes upon the prosecution (and the defendant, if the state seeks reciprocal discovery from him or her) a continuing duty to disclose additional discoverable material, if requested. Rule 16(h). Subsection (i) of Rule 16 allows the court to impose sanctions for noncompliance.', 'In Stravato, 935 A.2d at 953, the state admitted that the prosecutor had deliberately withheld a victim-impact statement from the defendant based on her good-faith belief that Rule 16 did not require her to produce it. We vacated the judgment of conviction, holding that because “the state’s nondisclosure was deliberate, * * * prejudice is presumed and the defendant [was] entitled to a new trial.” Id. We also observed that “[t]he [state’s] nondisclosure [was] particularly significant in a case such as this in which the prosecution relie[d] primarily on the testimony of the witness whose statement was withheld from [the] defendant.” Id. at 955.', 'Here, by contrast, the state characterized the nondisclosure of the victim-impact statements as “inadvertent” and denied that they were “consciously excluded” from the state’s responses to Thornton’s requests for discovery. Indeed, if the state had intended to conceal the presence of these statements from Thornton, filing them with the clerk of the court would have been a poor way to do so. We do not presume prejudice unless the nondisclosure was deliberate. See Stravato, 935 A.2d at 951 (citing State v. Vocatura, 922 A.2d 110, 118 (R.I. 2007)). After', '- 12 - reviewing the record, we conclude that Thornton was not prejudiced by the state’s failure to disclose the victim-impact statements under Rule 16.

The evidence must be “newly discovered or available only since trial” and must not have been “discoverable prior to trial despite the exercise of due diligence.” Id. In an affidavit, Thornton claimed that he had not seen the victim-impact statements until April 2010, when the state provided them to him pursuant to the hearing justice’s order. However, as stated above in our analysis of whether Thornton’s claims under Rule 16 and Brady are barred by res judicata, Thornton could have discovered the existence of the victim-impact statements through counsel well before he filed his subsequent application for postconviction relief.', 'Accordingly, Thornton is not entitled to postconviction relief based on newly discovered evidence.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 13 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties‘ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 3, 2011, defendant was charged by a criminal complaint with one count of ―assault or battery or both‖ on Patricia Kausel in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 ―in circumstances which are in violation of the protections offered through the Domestic Violence', '-1- Prevention Act,‖ G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5. A five-day jury trial was held in the Kent County Superior Court1 in October and November of 2011, during which defendant represented himself.', 'At trial, Ms. Kausel was the first witness to testify for the state. She stated that on June 3, 2011, she was living in East Greenwich with defendant, to whom she had been married for twelve years, and their two children. Ms. Kausel further stated that she had begun the process of seeking a divorce from defendant. Ms. Kausel testified that, at approximately 10 a.m. that morning, she was at home along with defendant and her mother, Barbara Creighan; she explained that she was working from home, as it was her custom to do on Fridays.', 'Ms. Kausel further testified that, while she was participating in a conference call, defendant was conducting various loud activities—such as mowing the lawn, turning up the volume on the television, and running the washer and dryer. She testified that, when she asked defendant to keep the noise down, he replied in a loud voice: ―[Y]ou‘re telling me to shut up?‖ When asked to describe defendant‘s demeanor while she was on the conference call, Ms. Kausel answered that she would describe it as ―a little belligerent.‖ She further testified that she terminated the call out of embarrassment and proceeded to take the dog for a walk; she indicated that, at that point in time, defendant was taking a shower.', 'Ms. Kausel testified that, upon returning from her walk, she saw defendant coming out of the bathroom completely unclothed. She stated that, in an effort to keep defendant out of her mother‘s sight, she tried ―herding him back into the bathroom‖ so that he could put his shorts back on. Ms. Kausel testified that she did not push or shove defendant; but she agreed that, because they were ―in close contact,‖ it was ―possible‖ that she had touched him ―without a push 1', 'After defendant was charged in Third Division District Court, the case was transferred to the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 23 of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and was prosecuted by the Attorney General.', '-2- or a shove.‖ She further testified that she reached down to grab defendant‘s shorts, and then she remembered a slap to her face. She added that she then dropped the shorts to the floor, ran out of the bathroom, told her mother to return to the master bedroom, and proceeded to call the police. Ms. Kausel told the jury that it was defendant‘s hand that struck her, leaving a red mark on her face (which mark she testified she saw when she looked in a mirror). The prosecutor also questioned Ms. Kausel with respect to photographs (which were later entered into evidence) of Ms. Kausel depicting the way that her face appeared after the incident, including a photograph of what Ms. Kausel described as a ―very clear picture of a bruise on [her] cheek.‖', 'Ms. Kausel testified that she would not have fabricated such a story for the purpose of having defendant removed from the home. Thereafter, during cross-examination of his wife, defendant sought to introduce a list in Ms. Kausel‘s handwriting which included such tasks as calling an attorney, buying a car, and closing various accounts. The defendant contended that the list demonstrated that Ms. Kausel had been taking steps to put herself in the best position with respect to the couple‘s divorce proceedings. However, the trial justice ruled that defendant was ―not going to try the divorce case in this case.‖ The trial justice reviewed the list and then ruled that it had no probative value and would only confuse the jury; consequently, he declined to permit the list to be entered into evidence.', 'Barbara Creighan, Ms. Kausel‘s mother, was the next witness to testify about the June 3, 2011 incident. Her testimony corroborated that of her daughter. The state also presented the testimony of three officers of the East Greenwich Police Department. All three of the officers stated that they had responded to the Kausel residence, and they proceeded to testify as to their involvement in the subsequent investigation.', '-3-', 'One of the three officers who testified for the state was Lieutenant Matthew Haley. He stated that he received a call at around 10 a.m. on June 3, 2011 directing him to respond to the Kausel residence. He further testified that, upon his arrival, defendant showed him a ―small scratch‖ on his arm that defendant asserted had resulted from that morning‘s altercation with Ms. Kausel. Lieutenant Haley stated that he then spoke with Ms. Kausel. He further testified that he observed a mark on Ms. Kausel‘s face. Lieutenant Haley added that, ―[Ms. Kausel] seemed to explain some things that I thought made more sense to what had actually occurred.‖', 'During cross-examination, defendant asked Lt. Haley if he had considered whether Ms. Kausel‘s injury had been ―self-inflicted‖; Lt. Haley answered that that was a possibility. Lieutenant Haley also acknowledged that he knew that defendant had been injured.2', 'The defendant proceeded with cross-examination of Lt. Haley as follows:', '―Q: Lieutenant is it possible that Mrs. Kausel‘s injury was caused', 'by the scuffle over the shorts in the bathroom?', '―A: I don‘t believe so.', '―Q: You don‘t believe so, is that what you said?', '―A: Yes.', '―Q: Why don‘t you believe that?', '―A: I believe it occurred as she told us.', '―* * *', '―Q: I said did you believe Mrs. Kausel that she had a red mark on', 'her face that she was struck, true?', '―A: Yes, sir, based on my years of experience and saw what I saw', 'that day, yes, I believed she was struck in the face.‖', 'On re-direct examination of Lt.

Haley‘s testimony, and defendant opted not to present any testimony or other evidence.', 'On November 2, 2011, the trial justice instructed the jury before the closing arguments took place. Within his instructions, the trial justice addressed the concepts of assault and battery; in pertinent part, he stated as follows:', '―An assault is an unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability,', 'and with the intent to commit a wrongful act, by means of physical', 'force, upon the person of another. In other words, an assault is an', 'unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do bodily', 'harm to another.', '―A battery is somewhat different. A battery is the physical', 'result of an accomplished assault; that is to say, the actual striking', 'of the other person; that‘s a battery.‖ Immediately after he finished giving his instructions to the jury, the trial justice expressly asked both parties whether there were any objections to the instructions. Both defendant and the prosecutor stated on the record that they had no objections. The parties proceeded to make their closing arguments, and the jury then retired to deliberate.', 'Shortly after the jury began its deliberations, the trial justice received a note from the jury foreperson. The note asked the trial justice: ―If it is an accident can there be intent[?]‖ The note also requested the definition of the word ―intent.‖', '-5-', 'During a discussion of the jury‘s note between the parties and the trial justice, defendant filed a motion for mistrial in open court claiming that the trial justice‘s instructions had ―failed to instruct completely on assault and battery‖; he elaborated by stating that the trial justice had ―stopped short in his instruction to inform the jury of the State[‘]s obligation in its burden of proof.‖', 'Before ruling on defendant‘s motion for mistrial, the trial justice turned to the question posed by the jury. The prosecutor asserted that general intent was the proper standard, and she asked the court to respond accordingly to the jury‘s note. The trial justice ultimately decided to wait until Friday, November 4, 2011 to respond to the jury‘s inquiry, and he allowed the jurors to continue deliberating.', 'When the jury reconvened on November 4, 2011, the trial justice responded to the question by giving a supplemental instruction. He stated, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―The answer to the question is: It depends. It depends on', 'the crime which is alleged and it depends on what the ―accident‖', 'was. * * * [T]he alleged crimes are domestic assault and/or', 'domestic battery. The underlying crimes—I only mentioned the', 'word ―intent‖ one time in my original instructions when I defined', 'those crimes. So let me define the type of intent these crimes', 'require; that is, what intent the state must prove beyond a', 'reasonable doubt for conviction here. The trial justice proceeded to expand on his earlier definition of intent, specifically instructing on the meaning of ―general intent.‖ (See Part III A of this Opinion, infra.)', 'The trial justice then asked the parties if they had any objections to the supplemental instruction. The trial justice denied defendant‘s request for further instructions and stated that, to the extent that defendant had objected to the supplemental instruction, he overruled his objection.', '-6-', 'Ultimately, on November 4, 2011, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty against defendant. After the verdict was rendered, the trial justice reserved judgment on defendant‘s motion for mistrial until the time of sentencing.', 'The defendant‘s sentencing hearing was held on November 22, 2011. At the hearing, the state presented a statement by Ms. Kausel that had been emailed (by Ms. Kausel‘s sister) to the prosecutor.3 The prosecutor told the trial justice that she had spoken with Ms. Kausel to confirm that she could not be present at the hearing because of work, but that she wanted the statement to be read. The defendant objected to the reading of the statement, arguing that ―if it [was] that important to her she should [have been there].‖ The trial justice overruled defendant‘s objection, and he allowed the statement to be read to the court. The defendant also asked if he would receive a copy of what was being read into the record, to which the trial justice responded that he would not because he was ―listening to it now.‖', 'The prosecutor read to the court Ms. Kausel‘s statement that defendant had been harassing her as recently as the weekend prior to the sentencing hearing. In addition, Ms. Kausel‘s statement referenced harassing emails from defendant dating back several months. The defendant again objected. The trial justice overruled defendant‘s objection and proceeded with the sentencing hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice sentenced defendant to forty days to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions with one year of probation.4 3', 'Ms. Kausel was not present at the sentencing hearing. 4', 'The trial justice additionally noted that defendant had not moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure or for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-7-', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant timely appealed,5 asserting that the trial justice erred: (1) by failing to properly instruct the jury as to the elements of the charged conduct, thereby relieving the state of the burden of proving mens rea; (2) in limiting defendant‘s cross-examination of the complaining witness; (3) in impermissibly allowing a police witness to vouch for the complaining witness‘s credibility; and (4) in withholding from defendant the statement by Ms. Kausel that had been received by the state after the trial concluded but prior to sentencing.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Jury Instructions', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in giving the jury instruction with respect to intent; specifically, defendant contends that the jury instruction ―absolved the [s]tate of the burden of proving mens rea.‖ Because defendant did not object to the initial instructions ―before the jury retire[d] to consider its verdict‖ (Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure), it is clear that defendant has preserved only a challenge to the supplemental jury instruction.', 'This Court reviews jury instructions in a de novo manner. State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 22 (R.I. 2012). In undertaking such a review, we look at the entire instruction to the jury in order to ―ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood 5', 'Although defendant filed his notice of appeal before the judgment of conviction entered, we consider it, as is our practice, to be timely.

Delestre, 35 A.3d 886, 891 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even in instances when we conclude that the trial justice erroneously instructed the jury, ―reversal is warranted only if a jury could have been misled to the prejudice of the complaining party.‖ State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 475 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, we have held that ―[c]ounsel‘s objection to the jury instruction must be made before the jury retires because once alerted to the perceived error in the instruction that has been given, the trial justice has an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies before the jury retires for deliberations.‖ State v.

Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 620 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have also reiterated that ―simple assault is a general intent crime.‖ Id. And we have stated that general intent crimes ―require only the intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires.‖ State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 914 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re Michael, 423 A.2d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 1981) (discussing the difference between general and specific intent crimes). The trial justice stated in the supplemental instruction, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―Assault and battery are both general intent crimes in our', 'state. These crimes require only the intent to make a bodily', 'movement which constitutes the acts which the crime requires.', 'Because you asked about accident let me add that the amount of', 'intent to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act', 'which the crime requires, is what the state must prove; nothing', '-9-', 'more.

[A]n assault is an unlawful attempt or offer with', 'force or violence to do bodily injury to another person. The state', 'does not have to prove that serious bodily harm actually resulted', 'from the alleged assault.‖ (Emphasis added.) The defendant correctly points out that the state was required to prove mens rea; however, we do not agree that the trial justice‘s instruction absolved the state of that burden of proof. Instead, with respect to general intent, he instructed (in language which very closely tracks what this Court has said about what general intent crimes require) as follows: ―These crimes require only the intent to make a bodily movement which constitutes the acts which the crime requires.‖ See Sivo, 925 A.2d at 914. In this case, we perceive no error in the trial justice‘s instruction on intent; he adequately instructed that there need be an intent to make a bodily movement, but not an intent to cause a specific harm. See id. The jury could not have convicted defendant without finding that he intended to make such a bodily movement in an ―unlawful‖ manner. Accordingly, we hold that the instruction adequately covered the law. See Delestre, 35 A.3d at 891.', 'B', 'Limitation on Cross-Examination', 'The defendant contends that, when the trial justice refused to allow him to question Ms. Kausel about a list that she had prepared, he thereby erroneously limited defendant‘s constitutional right to cross-examination. The state argues in response that the trial justice‘s limiting of defendant‘s cross-examination was within the discretion accorded to him by Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', '- 10 -', 'We have recognized that there is a ―fundamental right to cross-examine guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and art. I, sec. 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution * * *.‖ State v. DeBarros, 441 A.2d 549, 551 (R.I. 1982); see also State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397, 411 (R.I. 2007). And we have emphasized that the ―right of cross- examination is guaranteed to a criminal defendant because it is the principal means by which the credibility of the witness and the truthfulness of his [or her] testimony can be tested.‖ See State v. Tiernan, 941 A.2d 129, 133 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we have also noted that the right to cross-examination is not unlimited. See, e.g., Drew, 919 A.2d at 411 (―[The] right to cross-examination * * * is not unbounded.‖). A trial justice ―must not unduly restrict a defendant‘s right to cross-examine,‖ and we review a trial justice‘s determination to limit cross-examination for an abuse of discretion. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 1980). We have also noted that the ―discretionary authority to limit cross-examination comes into play [only] after there has been permitted as a matter of right sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.‖ State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1357 (R.I. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tiernan, 941 A.2d at 134.', 'We have also stated that ―[i]rrelevant questions and lines of questioning that offer to produce no probative evidence need not be permitted by the trial justice and may be properly limited.‖ State v. Gasparico, 694 A.2d 1204, 1208 (R.I. 1997). We note that the list defendant sought to introduce into evidence, which he contended indicated that Ms. Kausel‘s actions on the date of the incident were ―premeditated,‖ contained items such as purchasing a car, closing certain bank accounts, contacting an attorney, and other various items. We agree with the trial justice that that list was not probative and would likely have served only to confuse the jury.', '- 11 - Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in limiting defendant‘s cross-examination of Ms. Kausel by excluding the list.', 'C', 'The Defendant’s Contention About Improper Vouching', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in allowing Lt. Haley to express his opinion that defendant had been the aggressor; defendant contends that Lt. Haley thereby engaged in impermissible vouching by stating that he believed Ms. Kausel‘s version of events. The state argues that it was defendant‘s cross-examination of the officer that initially elicited the opinion testimony complained of, and it also contends that the trial justice did not err in allowing the state to return to the topic with the witness after defendant had opened the door to same.', 'We have held that ―a witness is not permitted to offer an opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony of another witness.‖ Drew, 919 A.2d at 412 (internal quotation marks omitted). That restriction on the permissible scope of testimony is related to the principle that the ―determination of the truthfulness or credibility of a witness lies within the exclusive province of the jury.‖', 'Id.

Webber, 716 A.2d 738, 742 (R.I. 1998). After determining that ―certain testimony constitutes impermissible ‗bolstering‘ or ‗vouching,‘ our task in reviewing a trial justice‘s decision to admit such testimony is to determine whether the admission of the testimony constituted prejudicial error with respect to the defendant.‖', '- 12 - Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476. In this case, we shall assume without deciding that the elicited testimony of the lieutenant constituted impermissible vouching or bolstering.6', 'After a careful review of the record in this case relative to what led up to the introduction of Lt. Haley‘s challenged testimony, we hold that the admission of this testimony did not constitute prejudicial error with respect to this defendant. See Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476. The defendant himself asked Lt. Haley who he believed had committed the assault, and he explored Lt. Haley‘s beliefs about the perpetrator of the assault during his cross-examination of the officer. Moreover, he objected to only one of the many statements about that issue during Lt. Haley‘s testimony on re-direct examination. In light of the testimony elicited from Lt. Haley by the questions posed by defendant while cross-examining him, it is our view that defendant could not have been prejudiced by questioning along those same lines during re-direct examination. See id.', 'D', 'The Use of Ms. Kausel’s Statement at Sentencing', 'Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in proceeding with defendant‘s sentencing after refusing to allow defendant to see or examine Ms. Kausel‘s statement that was read to the court at the sentencing hearing. The defendant argues that, because of that alleged error, defendant‘s sentence should be vacated and the case should be remanded to the Superior Court ―to permit him to have access to the letter prior to any further sentencing proceedings.‖ 6', 'We note that the state does not assert that Lt. Haley‘s testimony was proper; in fact, it limits its counterargument on appeal to the following contention: ―Defendant has no meritorious ground for appeal on [the improper vouching or bolstering] point even if all of Lieutenant Haley‘s testimony (on both cross and redirect) concerning whom Haley believed should have been excluded.‖', '- 13 -', 'In this case, the defendant concedes that the alleged error occurred after the verdict had been rendered and at the sentencing phase. In support of his argument, the defendant has cited to only one case, State v. Stravato, 935 A.2d 948 (R.I. 2007). In view of the fact that Stravato was decided under Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, we conclude that the defendant is essentially arguing that, pursuant to Rule 16, he was entitled to see the statement prepared by his wife that the prosecutor read into the record at the sentencing hearing. Assuming arguendo that Rule 16 applied to this statement and that this was a violation of that rule, the defendant has failed to point to any prejudice arising from Ms. Kausel‘s email having been read into the record rather than having been marked as an exhibit or otherwise provided to him. See generally State v. Pona, 810 A.2d 245, 250 (R.I. 2002) (―Even if [the state‘s conduct with respect to the statement] violated Rule 16, sanctions would not be warranted unless the violation prejudiced the defendant.‖).

The trial justice imposed upon the defendant the maximum sentence allowed under that law—twenty years to serve.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the charge against him should have been dismissed because the child abuse statute (viz., § 11-9-5.3) is unconstitutionally vague. He also argues that the trial justice erred when he admitted a statement that defendant wrote at the police station; defendant contends that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his Miranda rights1 before providing that statement. Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction. 1', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 28, 2011, the state charged defendant, DeAnthony Allen, by criminal information with one count of first degree child abuse in violation of § 11-9-5.3(b)(1); that criminal charge related to an incident that occurred in November of 2010. On November 8, 2011, defendant filed two pretrial motions, both of which are relevant to this appeal. One was a motion to suppress statements that defendant had made to the Pawtucket police because, according to defendant, ―they were obtained through violations of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.‖ The second motion contended that the criminal information should be dismissed because the statute under which defendant was charged (viz., § 11-9-5.3) was unconstitutionally vague.', 'At a hearing on the pretrial motions, the court first addressed defendant‘s motion to suppress. Only one witness testified at the hearing: Linda Bachand-Doucet, a detective in the Pawtucket Police Department who investigated the incident that led to the criminal charge against defendant.', 'At the hearing, Det. Bachand-Doucet testified regarding the following version of events.', 'On November 14, 2010, Det. Bachand-Doucet went to Hasbro Children‘s Hospital after receiving instructions to investigate an incident of alleged child abuse. After speaking with a physician at the hospital, a representative of the Department of Children, Youth and Families, and the infant‘s mother, the detective tried to reach defendant by telephone, but was unsuccessful. However, two days later, defendant called Det. Bachand-Doucet back, and she told him that the police ―needed to talk to him about the baby.‖ The defendant came to the Pawtucket police station by bus that same day, arriving at noon.', '-2-', 'Once defendant arrived at the police station, Det. Bachand-Doucet brought him into a conference room, where she asked him what his level of education was; defendant told her that he had dropped out of high school. The detective said that defendant was eighteen years old as of the day he came to the police station.', 'Detective Bachand-Doucet gave defendant a ―rights form‖ that set forth the Miranda warnings. At 12:05 p.m., Det. Bachand-Doucet had defendant read those rights out loud; she also had him mark his initials next to each of his rights ―to make sure he underst[ood].‖ The rights form included a line that defendant ―checked off‖ to indicate that he understood his rights. After defendant read his rights, Det. Bachand-Doucet watched him sign the document. Detective Bachand-Doucet testified that defendant never said that he did not understand the rights which he had read out loud; he also never asked her any questions about those rights. She said that it took defendant ―less than five minutes‖ to complete the rights form.', 'After defendant had read and signed the rights form, Det. Bachand-Doucet ―asked him what happened.‖ She engaged in a brief conversation with defendant about the incident that she was investigating, and then defendant wrote and signed a statement that was eventually admitted as a full exhibit and read to the jury at trial. The detective said that it took defendant ―maybe ten or fifteen minutes‖ to write the statement; she added that the statement was taken at 12:20 p.m.— approximately fifteen minutes after defendant had read his rights.', 'The motion justice ruled on the motion to suppress from the bench. He stated that he found the sole witness, Det. Bachand-Doucet, to be ―nothing but credible.‖ The motion justice was ―completely satisfied‖ that the police ―properly advised * * * defendant of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona.‖ The motion to suppress was therefore denied.', '-3-', 'As for the motion to dismiss, defense counsel stated that his ―void for vagueness‖ challenge would depend on ―the facts in this particular case,‖ and therefore he reserved his argument until after the evidence was presented at trial.', 'The defendant‘s two-day jury trial began on November 9, 2011. As its first witness, the state called the infant‘s mother, Stephanie Marks. She testified that, on Thursday, November 11, 2010, she left her son in defendant‘s care for the weekend while she went to work as a caretaker in Tiverton. She told the jury that she received a call from defendant between 5 and 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, November 14, 2010, and that defendant told her that the infant ―wasn‘t acting right.‖ Ms. Marks stated that she thought it was just a ―typical baby situation where the baby was sick or [was] just being fussy because he‘s only four months old.‖ She testified that she told defendant to ―soothe‖ their son and to ―do what a parent‘s suppose[d]‖ to do.', 'Ms. Marks went on to testify that she received a second call from defendant around 6:30 or 7 a.m. on Sunday, in which defendant indicated that ―everything was fine.‖ She stated that she then received a third call from defendant around 9:30 or 10 a.m., during which defendant told her that their son was not ―acting right‖ and that he was ―breathing weird‖ and was ―starting to get really hot.‖ Ms. Marks told the jury that she ―started panicking.‖ She testified that she then drove from Tiverton to Memorial Hospital. At Memorial Hospital, she was told that her son was being transferred to Hasbro Children‘s Hospital because ―he was having extremely bad seizures, he was having internal bleeding to the brain, and * * * he couldn‘t breathe right on his own.‖ She told the jury that, after asking defendant what happened to their son, he told her that he had grabbed the baby‘s legs as he was falling off the bed and that ―the baby‘s head skimmed the floor.‖', 'When asked how her son was doing at the time of trial, Ms. Marks replied:', '-4-', '―He‘s doing good. It‘s just hard. He‘s a disabled baby now. He', 'can‘t see. He has special equipment. He goes to early', 'interventions, EACs, nonstop therapist on a weekly basis, every', 'day there‘s something he has to be doing.‖', 'The prosecutor also offered the testimony of Dr. Brett Slingsby—one of the physicians who had treated the infant at Hasbro. Doctor Slingsby testified as both a fact witness and as an expert in pediatric medicine with an emphasis on child abuse. Doctor Slingsby stated that, on November 14, 2010, he was called into the hospital ―because there was concern for abuse of‖ the infant. He stated that, when he initially examined the infant, he observed multiple bruises on his head and bleeding within his mouth. Doctor Slingsby also testified that tests revealed ―new blood‖ in the tissue layer between the infant‘s skull and brain. He responded affirmatively when asked whether the injury was ―consistent with head trauma syndrome or with shaking.‖ He stated that x-rays further revealed that the infant had multiple fractures in his ribs on both the right and left sides, which he agreed were ―consistent with * * * squeezing or pressure to the chest.‖ Doctor Slingsby testified that he also consulted with an ophthalmologist, who found retinal hemorrhaging ―behind both eyes from the inside all the way out to the sides of both eyes.‖', 'Doctor Slingsby told the jury that, in his opinion, the infant ―was a victim of physical abuse as well as abusive head trauma.‖', 'The prosecutor also called Det.

The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal; that motion was also denied. The jury returned a guilty verdict within an hour.', 'On November 14, 2011, defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Based on the evidence presented at trial, the infant suffered injuries that fell squarely within the specific definition of ―serious bodily injury‖ provided by the General Assembly.

Even though defendant was a high school dropout, Det. Bachand-Doucet testified that defendant was able to read all of the Miranda rights out loud. Further, defendant signed his initials next to each right to acknowledge that he understood those rights; he also ―checked off‖ a line indicating that he understood his rights, and he signed the rights form.

This case is before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the record, the memoranda submitted to this Court on behalf of the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the denial of the defendants’ motion for leave to file a third-party complaint.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The initial complaint in this case was filed in the Superior Court for Providence County on December 24, 2008 by The Wampanoag Group, LLC and Andrew Annaldo (collectively, the buyers). The litigation arose after the buyers purchased real estate located on Wampanoag Trail in East Providence (the property) on January 4, 2008. In their complaint, the buyers alleged that they had retained Attorney James Iacoi and the law firm of Calenda & Iacoi, Ltd. (collectively,', '-1- the attorneys) in connection with their purchase of the property. The buyers’ complaint stated that they paid $4,650,000 for the property ―based upon the premise that‖ certain leases on the property ―were triple net leases.‖1', 'The buyers further alleged that they had ―entrusted [the attorneys] with the responsibility for reviewing [the] leases and advising them as to their contents and, specifically, whether the leases were, in fact, triple net leases.‖ The complaint then alleged, however, that the leases were not triple net leases—which meant, according to the complaint, that the property was worth only $2,940,000. Accordingly, the buyers alleged that they had ―overpaid the Seller by slightly more than $1,700,000.00 due to the negligence of the [attorneys].‖', 'On October 1, 2010, the attorneys (the defendants in the underlying civil action) filed a motion for leave to file a third-party complaint pursuant to Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In their proposed third-party complaint, the attorneys named Gammons Realty, LLC (d/b/a Prudential Gammons Realty), Christopher J. Cioe, and Rocco A. Quattrocchi (collectively, the agents) as third-party defendants.2 The attorneys alleged that the agents were involved in the purchase of the property by way of a ―dual agency‖—which meant, according to the motion for leave, that ―they had a fiduciary duty to both the seller and buyers.‖ The motion for leave further stated that, ―if it is established that the [buyers] are entitled to recover for their alleged damages,‖ then the agents would be ―liable for all or part of the [buyers’] claims against [the attorneys].‖ On November 5, 2010, the court granted the attorneys’ motion over the buyers’ objection. 1', 'A ―triple net lease‖ is a ―lease in which the lessee pays all the expenses, including mortgage interest and amortization, leaving the lessor with an amount free of all claims.‖ Black’s Law Dictionary 972 (9th ed. 2009). 2', 'The third-party complaint alleged that Messrs. Cioe and Quattrocchi were real estate agents at Gammons Realty, LLC.', '-2-', 'The agents then filed motions to dismiss the third-party complaint. On August 2, 2011, the court held a hearing on the agents’ motions. The motion justice granted the agents’ motions and dismissed the third-party complaint, stating that the third-party complaint ―fail[ed] to plead any cognizable duty that may be owed by the [agents] either to the defendant or to the plaintiff.‖', 'Although the motion justice dismissed the third-party complaint, she did so ―without prejudice,‖ noting that there ―were conversations between Mr. Quattrocchi and the [buyers] regarding the nature of the leases‖ and also commenting that she was ―troubled by the nature of [the] dual representation‖ and ―the fact that the commission * * * was paid based on the leases.‖', 'The attorneys thereafter filed a second motion for leave to file a third-party complaint. This time, their proposed complaint was more detailed, including, inter alia, allegations (1) that the agents had ―reviewed the leases in existence on the Property,‖ (2) that the agents had ―prepared financial information and projections for the Property based on the income generated by the leases * * * knowing that the [buyers] would rely on that information,‖ (3) that the agents had ―falsely represented that the leases in existence on the Property were triple net leases,‖ and (4) that the buyers had ―relied upon the incorrect assertion that the leases were triple net leases in connection with their purchase.‖ The attorneys also alleged that the agents had assumed and breached a fiduciary duty to the buyers. The proposed third-party complaint then stated that, based on these allegations, the agents were liable to the attorneys for contribution or indemnification.', 'A different motion justice3 denied the attorneys’ second motion for leave to file a third- party complaint. He agreed with the first motion justice that the attorneys ―did not allege a duty 3', 'All further references in this opinion to ―the motion justice‖ relate to the motion justice who passed on the second motion for leave to file a third-party complaint.', '-3- that ran from the third-party defendant [i.e., the agents] to the third-party plaintiff [i.e., the attorneys].‖ (Emphasis added.) He then continued as follows:', '―Rule 14 only allows a third-party action if the third-party', 'defendant is liable to the third-party plaintiff. * * * Rule 14 is', 'inapplicable when the third-party defendant is allegedly liable only', 'to the plaintiff. The rule simply does not apply to that situation.‖ Accordingly, the court held that, because the third-party complaint ―fail[ed] to allege a cause of action by the third-party plaintiff against the third-party defendant,‖ the motion for leave was denied.', 'The attorneys then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, requesting that this Court review the motion justice’s decision to deny their second motion for leave to file a third-party complaint. This Court granted that petition on May 17, 2012.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under Rule 14, the decision as to whether or not to allow a defendant to file a third-party complaint is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. E.g., Pettella v. Corp Brothers, Inc., 107 R.I. 599, 613, 268 A.2d 699, 706 (1970). However, in this case, the motion for leave was not denied pursuant to an exercise of such discretion; instead, it was denied based on the motion justice’s understanding of the legal requirements of Rule 14. Accordingly, we will conduct a de novo review. See Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1011 (R.I. 2007) (―When faced with a trial justice’s rulings regarding questions of law * * * we will conduct a de novo review.‖); cf. McKenna v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp., 475 F.3d 418, 422 (1st Cir. 2007) (―[A] district court necessarily abuses its discretion when its decision or judgment depends upon an incorrect view of the law.‖).', '-4-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'This case presents an issue of civil procedure. Specifically, we must decide whether the attorney defendants’ second proposed third-party complaint falls within the scope of Rule 14, which governs impleader. Rule 14(a) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―At any time after commencement of the action a defending party,', 'as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint to', 'be served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be', 'liable to the third party plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff’s', 'claim against the third party plaintiff.‖', 'It is our opinion that the attorneys’ proposed third-party complaint presented an appropriate use of impleader under Rule 14.', 'That rule states that a potential third-party defendant is one ―who is or may be liable to the third party plaintiff for all or part of‖ the original plaintiff’s claim. The attorneys’ proposed complaint bases that liability on two theories: (1) contribution under the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 10 (the UCAJTA) and (2) common law indemnification.', 'The UCAJTA recognizes a right of contribution between joint tortfeasors if they are both liable in tort to the original plaintiff and their respective wrongful conduct caused the ―same injury‖ to the original plaintiff. See Wilson v. Krasnoff, 560 A.2d 335, 339 (R.I. 1989); see also §§ 10-6-2, 10-6-3. In the complaint that initiated this litigation, the buyers alleged (1) that the attorneys were responsible for reviewing the existing leases, (2) that the attorneys assured the buyers that the leases were triple net leases, and (3) that the buyers relied on that assurance when they purchased the property. Similarly, the attorneys’ proposed third-party complaint alleges (1) that the agents reviewed those same leases, (2) that the agents falsely represented that the leases were triple net leases, and (3) that the buyers relied on that false representation when purchasing the property.', '-5-', 'When the underlying complaint and the second proposed third-party complaint are viewed together, they collectively allege that the attorneys and the agents are potentially joint tortfeasors—that is, both parties may be liable in tort (viz., negligence and/or breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the attorneys and false representation and/or breach of fiduciary duty4 on the part of the agents) for the ―same injury‖ (viz., causing the buyers to overpay for the property based on their belief that the existing leases were triple net leases).5 See Wilson, 560 A.2d at 339.', 'The motion justice appears to have read Rule 14 as being more demanding than it actually is; he stated that there had to be a duty running from the third-party defendants (the agents) to the third-party plaintiffs (the attorneys). There is no such requirement. Instead, the third-party defendants must only be potentially liable to the third-party plaintiffs, and the UCAJTA provides for that liability. See § 10-6-3 (―The right of contribution exists among joint tortfeasors * * *.‖). In fact, in Cosentino v. Blackman, 651 A.2d 1227, 1227 (R.I. 1994) (mem.), we explicitly acknowledged that ―Rule 14 allows a defendant to bring in a third-party for contribution and/or indemnification.‖ See also Roberts-Robertson v. Lombardi, 598 A.2d 1380, 1381 (R.I. 1991) (recognizing that joint tortfeasors may ―seek contribution pursuant to [the 4', 'On appeal, Mr. Cioe argues that the agents could not have breached a fiduciary duty by failing to properly review the leases because, under G.L. 1956 § 5-20.6-1, a real estate agent cannot assume such a duty unless it is in writing. That statute, however, applies only to residential real estate transactions, see § 5-20.6-2(17), and the agents have not alleged that the property at issue in this case was residential real estate. 5', 'We express no opinion as to the merits of the claims alleged by the attorneys in the third- party complaint. We are simply recognizing that their third-party complaint presents allegations that fall within the ambit of Rule 14. Whether those allegations have merit is an issue that will have to be resolved at a later point in time. Cf. 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1448 at 456 (3d ed. 2010) (―Because the question whether someone is a joint tortfeasor is largely one of fact to be determined by the jury, a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint on the ground that it fails to state a claim normally should be denied and the third- party plaintiff allowed an opportunity to produce evidence as to the nature of the relationship.‖).', '-6- UCAJTA] either by a separate action or by impleading the fellow joint tortfeasor under third- party practice‖ (emphasis added)); 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1448 at 453–54 (3d ed. 2010) (recognizing that, ―[i]f the governing substantive law recognizes a right of contribution [as is the case in Rhode Island], impleader under Rule 14 is a proper procedure by which to seek relief from joint tortfeasors‖).', 'Likewise, the alternative common law indemnity claim in the attorneys’ proposed third- party complaint also falls within the bounds of Rule 14. The elements of such a claim are (1) ―the party seeking indemnity must be liable to a third party‖; (2) ―the prospective indemnitor must also be liable to the third party‖; and (3) ―as between the prospective indemnitee and indemnitor, the obligation ought to be discharged by the indemnitor.‖', 'Muldowney v. Weatherking Products, Inc., 509 A.2d 441, 443 (R.I. 1986). As indicated above, the original complaint and the third-party complaint collectively allege that both the attorneys and the agents may be liable to the buyers. If the attorneys are able to introduce evidence which proves that the agents’ acts were ―the active and primary cause of [the buyers’] injury,‖ then the attorneys would be entitled to seek common law indemnity. See Helgerson v. Mammoth Mart, Inc., 114 R.I. 438, 442, 335 A.2d 339, 341–42 (1975) (―At the pleading stage it is virtually impossible to ascertain the right of [a third-party plaintiff] to indemnity.‖). Accordingly, from the perspective of the law of indemnity, the agents’ third-party complaint satisfies the requirements of Rule 14.6 See Cosentino, 651 A.2d at 1227 (acknowledging that ―Rule 14 allows a defendant to bring in a third-party for * * * indemnification‖). 6', 'Again, we express no opinion as to the merits of the allegations set forth in the attorneys’ proposed third-party complaint. See footnote 5, supra.', '-7-', 'It is therefore our opinion that the motion justice erred when he denied the attorneys’ motion for leave to file a third-party complaint on the ground that their proposed complaint ―fail[ed] to allege a cause of action by the third-party plaintiff against the third-party defendant.‖ Rule 14 requires that a third-party plaintiff must allege that the third-party defendants are or may be liable for all or some of the original plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff. The UCAJTA and common law indemnity provide for that liability. See, e.g., Cosentino, 651 A.2d at 1227; see also Hawkins v. Gadoury, 713 A.2d 799, 803 (R.I. 1998) (noting that the UCAJTA ―recognizes that a cause of action for contribution is separate and distinct from the * * * tort that initially accrued to the injured party‖ (emphasis added)). By alleging that the agents are liable in tort to the buyers for the alleged overpayment for the property, the attorneys’ proposed third- party complaint falls within Rule 14’s boundaries.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the Superior Court’s denial of the attorney defendants’ motion for leave to file a third-party complaint.

17,No. 2010-371-C.A. (P1/94-3386AG) State : v. : Adrian Hazard.,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Adrian Hazard,1 appeals from an adjudication of probation violation. While on probation, the defendant fled from two uniformed police officers after they instructed him to stop his vehicle. After the defendant‘s brief flight came to an end and he was arrested, a replica of an 1858 Remington revolver was discovered on the floor of his car. On the basis of this conduct, the trial justice found the defendant to be a violator of the terms and conditions of his probation, and the defendant appealed.', 'In addition to the probation-violation proceeding, the state charged defendant with recklessly operating a motor vehicle, carrying a revolver without a license, and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence. Apparently concerned about the trial justice‘s interpretation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-2(3) and (8) during the course of the violation 1', 'The defendant‘s first name is spelled ―Adrien‖ in much of the transcript of the proceedings below. However, most of the record uses the spelling ―Adrian,‖ as does his brief.', '-1- hearing, the state requested, in a motion in limine, that the trial justice interpret the Firearms Act (Firearms Act or act), chapter 47 of title 11, in such a manner that a weapon need not be capable of expelling a projectile, or be readily convertible to do so, in order to fit within the definitions of ―firearm‖ or ―pistol.‖ The trial justice denied the state‘s motion and incorporated his earlier ruling from the violation hearing. The state timely appealed.2 After careful consideration, we affirm the trial justice in all respects.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 8, 1996, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter and one count of carrying a pistol without a license.', 'He was sentenced to thirty years for the manslaughter count, with fifteen years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation, and a consecutive ten-year term, suspended, with probation, for the firearms conviction. While on probation after his release from incarceration, defendant was arrested. The circumstances of that arrest follow.', 'On December 30, 2009, Providence Police Patrolmen Ludwig Castro (Ptlm. Castro) and Eugene Chin (Ptlm. Chin) received information that a gold Volkswagen would be in the area of Linwood Avenue and Cranston Street and that there was a firearm inside the vehicle. Patrolmen Castro and Chin responded to that intersection and soon observed a gold Volkswagen, driven by defendant, turn onto Cranston Street. While the officers followed the vehicle, they observed defendant make a right turn without using a turn signal and then stop in the roadway, obstructing the flow of traffic, while he spoke with a pedestrian. Patrolman Chin activated the overhead lights of his police cruiser, and Ptlm. Castro exited the cruiser and approached the driver‘s side door of the Volkswagen. Patrolman Castro testified that he did not remove his weapon from its 2', 'The state‘s appeal and defendant‘s appeal have been consolidated.', '-2- holster when he approached the Volkswagen. He then instructed defendant to pull the vehicle over; defendant responded by fleeing the scene. Patrolman Castro testified that he and Ptlm. Chin pursued defendant at speeds in excess of forty miles per hour until the Volkswagen was cut off by another police cruiser, bringing the chase to an abrupt end.', 'Patrolman Castro further testified that, when he approached the vehicle after the stop, he observed the front-seat passenger, Carlos Washington (Washington), hunched over with his hands between his legs. He then spotted the ―shiny barrel of a revolver‖ on the floor of the Volkswagen. Both defendant and Washington were taken into custody, and the officers retrieved a replica of a Remington 1858 .44-caliber black powder revolver from the floor of the vehicle.', 'The defendant also testified at his probation-violation hearing, offering a different version of the events of December 30, 2009. He testified that he saw a man approach him with a gun drawn and that he ―blacked out‖ and sped off because he was afraid that the man was about to start shooting. He further testified that he did not realize that the man who approached his vehicle was a police officer and that, as soon as he realized that the police were chasing him, he stopped immediately.', 'Camille Stokes (Stokes), defendant‘s close friend who said she witnessed these events, testified in support of defendant. She testified that she saw defendant flee after a man wielding a gun approached his car. She related that she followed defendant in her own vehicle and that he stopped as soon as the police activated their overhead lights.', 'Washington, who is defendant‘s half-brother,3 also testified for the defense. He claimed that he owned the revolver and brought it into the Volkswagen on the day that he and defendant were arrested.', 'He further testified that he never informed defendant that he was armed. 3', 'The record refers to Washington as defendant‘s brother, step-brother and half-brother. After reviewing the entire record, however, it appears most likely that the two are half-brothers.', '-3- Washington testified that, as soon as the police chase began, he threw the gun on the floor of the car because he did not want to be caught with it on his person.', 'Washington‘s testimony was in sharp contrast to that of Detective Thomas M. Rawnsley (Det. Rawnsley) of the Youth Services Bureau of the Providence Police Department, who questioned Washington after he was arrested.', 'Detective Rawnsley testified that, while Washington was being questioned, he told Det. Rawnsley that defendant was attempting to flee from the police and that defendant, not Washington, pulled out the gun and threw it on the floor.', 'The trial justice found that neither Stokes nor Washington was credible. He pointed out inconsistencies within each of their statements and found that each had a strong motivation to lie based on their close relationships with defendant. The trial justice rejected defendant‘s story about his alleged blackout and credited the testimony of Ptlm. Castro and Chin. He found that the officers‘ weapons were not drawn when they first approached defendant‘s vehicle and that defendant deliberately eluded them because he knew the gun was in the vehicle. Based on these findings, the trial justice determined that defendant‘s actions in eluding the police constituted a failure to keep the peace and remain on good behavior; on that basis, the trial justice determined that defendant had violated the terms of his probation.', 'The trial justice then went on to address the evidence concerning the weapon that had been found in the car. First, he explained that he was ―certain‖ that Washington had lied when he testified that he brought the gun into the car, describing his testimony as ―a perjurious effort to take the onus off his half[-]brother * * *.‖ The trial justice concluded that it was defendant, and not Washington, who possessed the gun. However, because the evidence was clear that the', '-4- weapon was damaged and unable to be fired in the condition in which it was found,4 an issue remained as to whether it constituted a ―firearm‖ or ―pistol,‖ as those terms are defined in the Firearms Act. The defendant requested that the trial justice rule that the weapon was an ―antique firearm[] unsuitable for use,‖ which would place it outside the ambit of the act. Section 11-47- 25.', 'First, the trial justice found that the gun was not an antique firearm unsuitable for use under § 11-47-25. Next, the trial justice held that possessing a pistol, or the frame or receiver of a gun, did not violate §§ 11-47-5 or 11-47-8 unless the pistol, or the frame or receiver, either had the capability to expel a projectile or might readily be converted to do so. With respect to the subject revolver, the trial justice was satisfied that it could be readily converted to expel a projectile and, therefore, qualified as a ―firearm‖ and a ―pistol‖ under the Firearms Act.5 Accordingly, the trial justice identified yet another basis on which to rest his probation-violation adjudication: defendant had failed to keep the peace and remain on good behavior because he carried a pistol without a license and possessed a firearm despite being convicted of a crime of violence.', 'After announcing his conclusion that defendant violated his probation, the trial justice addressed the issue of what portion of defendant‘s suspended sentence should be executed. The trial justice heard argument from the state, defense counsel, and defendant; he then ordered defendant to serve ten years of the previously imposed suspended sentence. 4', 'It was undisputed that the revolver was unable to fire because of damage to the nipples at the end of the cylinder, which prevented the nipples from accepting priming or percussion caps. 5', 'The trial justice found that the revolver could be made operable by replacing the cylinder. He further observed that a replacement cylinder was inexpensive, costing approximately $80, and readily available via the Internet or from a retailer.', '-5-', 'Meanwhile, the state was continuing in its prosecution of defendant on the charges of recklessly operating a motor vehicle, carrying a revolver without a license, and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence.', 'In light of the trial justice‘s interpretation of the Firearms Act during the course of the probation-violation hearing, the state filed a motion in limine, requesting the court to construe the act such that a weapon need not have the capability to expel a projectile, or be readily convertible to do so, in order to qualify as a ―pistol‖ under § 11-47-2(8). Additionally, the state sought a ruling that a pistol is per se a ―firearm‖ under § 11-47-2(3), and that the mere frame or receiver of a weapon also constitutes a ―firearm‖ under that section, whether or not the pistol, or the frame or receiver, can expel a projectile or be readily converted to do so. The trial justice denied the state‘s motion, concluding that his interpretation of the statute at the probation-violation hearing was correct.', 'Both the state and defendant are now before us, each side assigning error to different aspects of the trial justice‘s rulings in both cases.', 'Analysis', 'We must decide whether the trial justice erred in (1) finding that defendant violated his probation and (2) his interpretation of the Firearms Act. We first address the state‘s appeal before tackling the trial justice‘s probation-violation adjudication.', 'I', '“Firearm”', 'In its appeal, the state challenges the trial justice‘s interpretation of the term ―firearm‖ in § 11-47-2(3). Section 11-47-2(3) provides:', '―‗Firearm‘ includes any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle,', 'air pistol, ‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ or other instrument from which', 'steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be', 'converted to expel a projectile, except crossbows, recurve,', '-6-', 'compound, or longbows, and except instruments propelling', 'projectiles which are designed or normally used for a primary', 'purpose other than as a weapon. The frame or receiver of the', 'weapon shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this', 'section.‖ The trial justice held that the phrase ―from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile‖ applied to all of the instruments listed in § 11-47-2(3), such that a machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, blank gun or BB gun must either have the capability to expel a projectile, or be readily convertible to do so, in order to constitute a ―firearm.‖ Before this Court, the state asserts that ―[t]he sole issue is whether the qualifying phrase, ‗from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile,‘ refers only to ‗other instrument‘ or refers to all of the weapons identified in the preceding list, including a pistol.‖ (Emphasis added.)', '―[W]e review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.‖ Campbell v.

There are several reasons for this conclusion, but we note at the outset that the comprehensive history of the Firearms Act is critical to our analysis. As discussed more fully below, when the Firearms Act was first enacted in 1927, there could be little doubt that the act reached only weapons that could fire a bullet. None of the several amendments to the act expressly have abrogated this requirement. What the state‘s last- antecedent-rule argument boils down to, then, is a plea that we presume that the General Assembly abrogated this requirement by implication arising from the several amendments to the act over the course of several decades.', 'The same can be said for the state‘s secondary arguments. We reject this plea, however, because ―[a]mendments by implication, like repeals by implication, are not favored.‖ United States v.

Mullins, 446 F.3d 750, 755, 756 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that there was sufficient evidence that the defendant‘s .22-caliber starter gun could readily ―be converted to expel a projectile, without any specialized knowledge, in less than an hour, and in minutes by an expert‖); United States v. 16,179 Molso Italian .22 Caliber Winlee Derringer Convertible Starter Guns, 443 F.2d 463, 464, 465 (2d Cir. 1971) (concluding that .22-caliber starter guns could readily be converted to expel a projectile because they ―could be converted to shoot live ammunition within three to twelve minutes‖).', '- 13 -', 'Moreover, the General Assembly‘s use of the word ―other‖ in the last antecedent ―other instrument‖ also is telling.', 'If the General Assembly intended to convey that, in order to constitute firearms, the delineated instruments—machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, ―blank gun,‖ and ―BB gun‖—need not be capable of firing, or be readily convertible to do so, then the word ―other‖ creates unnecessary dissonance and surplusage in the definition of ―firearm.‖ If the word ―other‖ simply was omitted, a ―firearm‖ would include ―any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, ‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ or instrument from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile.‖', 'The statute we interpreted in Brown provides another apt illustration. That statute, § 7-15-1, defined ―racketeering activity‖ as ―any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, larceny or prostitution, or any dealing in narcotic or dangerous drugs which is [chargeable] as a crime under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one (1) year.‖', 'Brown, 486 A.2d at 599 (quoting § 7-15-1) (emphases added). The General Assembly employed the word ―or‖ twice in that definition to isolate the last antecedent from the other previously listed items; the first ―or‖ concluded the list of the initial category of offenses that constituted racketeering activity, without regard to whether those offenses were felonies, and the second ―or‖ created a second category of offenses that constituted racketeering activity, provided that those offenses were felonies. In other words, the statute defined two categories of racketeering activity: ―any act or threat involving [(1)] murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, larceny or prostitution, or [(2)] any dealing in narcotic or dangerous drugs which is [chargeable] as a crime under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one (1) year.‖ Id.

In 1927, during the height of Prohibition, the General Assembly entered the fray of weapons regulation and enacted the Firearms Act in order to regulate the possession of firearms. P.L. 1927, ch. 1052, §§ 1-20. The term ―firearm‖ was defined to ―include any machine gun or pistol.‖ Id., § 1. This first iteration of the Firearms Act also defined ―machine gun‖ and ―pistol,‖ and each term clearly contemplated that the instrument be capable of firing. The act provided that the term ―‗[m]achine gun‘ shall include any weapon which shoots automatically and any weapon which shoots more than twelve shots semi- automatically without reloading.‖ Id. (emphases added). Although the definition of the term ―pistol‖ did not require explicitly that the instrument be capable of firing, the context makes clear', '- 15 - that, to qualify as a ―pistol‖ in 1927, the weapon needed to have the capability to shoot: ―‗Pistol‘ shall include any pistol or revolver, and any shot gun, rifle or similar weapon with overall length less than twenty-six inches, but shall not include any pistol without a magazine or any pistol or revolver designed for the use of blank cartridges only.‖ Id. (emphasis added). Thus, when the statute was enacted in 1927, there was no hint that the Firearms Act encompassed inoperable instruments.', 'Time marched on, but the definition of ―firearm‖ remained the same until 1950, when the General Assembly broadened its reach beyond pistols and machine guns. See P.L. 1950, ch. 2452, § 1. The amended definition read as follows: ―‗Firearm‘ shall include any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, ‗blank gun‘, ‗BB gun‘, so-called, or other instrument from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled.‖ Id. Notably, the definitions of ―machine gun‖ and ―pistol‖ were not amended at this time. Properly understood, then, the 1950 amendment simply added certain instruments—with which the modifying clause ―from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled‖ undeniably makes sense—along with the last antecedent ―other instrument‖ to the 1927 Firearms Act‘s definition of ―firearm,‖ which included only items that had the capability to expel a projectile.', 'Since 1950, there have been several additional iterations of the definition of ―firearm.‖ In 1959, the General Assembly added an exception carving out ―instruments propelling [steel or metal] projectiles which instruments are designed or normally used for a primary purpose other than as a weapon.‖ P.L. 1959, ch. 75, § 1.9 In 1975, the definition was amended to read: 9', 'The entire definition of ―firearm‖ under P.L. 1959, ch. 75, § 1 read as follows:', '―‗Firearm‘ shall include any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol,', '‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ so-called, or other instrument from which steel or metal', 'projectiles are propelled, except such instruments propelling such projectiles', '- 16 -', '―‗Firearm‘ shall include any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air', 'rifle, air pistol, ‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ so-called or other', 'instrument from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or', 'which may readily be converted to expel a projectile, except', 'such instruments propelling such projectiles which instruments are', 'designed or normally used for a primary purpose other than as a', 'weapon.

P.L. 1991, ch. 333, § 1.10 Lastly, except for minor stylistic changes, the final amendment to the definition of ―firearm‖ arose during the 2012 legislative session when the General Assembly added ―crossbows‖ to the ―recurve, compound, or longbows‖ exception.

Rather, this legislative history demonstrates that, when it first enacted the Firearms Act in 1927, the General Assembly intended to regulate the possession and use of dangerous weapons that had the capability to fire a projectile—namely, ―pistols‖ and ―machine guns‖ as those terms were understood in 1927—such that criminals were prohibited from possessing those dangerous instruments. The legislative history from 1927 onward does not suggest an intent to broaden the scope of the Firearms Act to encompass instruments that are incapable of firing or may have been rendered permanently inoperable.12', 'In the last analysis, we are convinced that there are two reasonable interpretations of § 11-47-2(3). Because the interpretation called for by the last antecedent rule is opposed to the 12', 'The state cites to the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals in People v. O‘Neal, 228 P.3d 211, 213-15 (Colo. App. 2009), a case invoking the last antecedent rule in the context of Colorado‘s firearms laws, to support its interpretation of the term ―firearm‖ in our Firearms Act. However, O‘Neal readily is distinguishable from this case. As the O‘Neal Court observed, when the firearms statute under examination in that case was enacted ―[i]n 1971, the ‗last antecedent‘ rule of statutory construction was well established in Colorado law.‖ Id. at 215. Therefore, the notion that the Colorado General Assembly was aware of the last antecedent rule and drafted legislation in accordance with it as a means of expressing legislative intent is sound.', 'Here, by contrast, the legislative history of the Firearms Act, when juxtaposed with this Court‘s treatment of the last antecedent rule, points to the opposite conclusion. The Firearms Act was enacted in 1927, P.L. 1927, ch. 1052, §§ 1-20, and the first half of the qualifying language—―from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled‖—was supplied in 1950. P.L. 1950, ch. 2452, § 1. The General Assembly added the second half of the qualifying language— ―or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile‖—in 1975. P.L. 1975, ch. 278, § 1. We did not recognize the last antecedent rule as an interpretive tool until 1985. See Brown, 486 A.2d at 600. Therefore, the assumption underlying the last antecedent rule—that a legislature is aware of it and drafts legislation in accordance with it—was much more persuasive in O‘Neal than it is here. When coupled with the other reasons why we deem the state‘s singular reliance on the last antecedent rule misplaced, this distinction convinces us that O‘Neal adds little to the analysis under our own Firearms Act.', '- 18 - interpretation called for by the meaning readily deducible from the structure, language and legislative history of the provision, we conclude that the state‘s last-antecedent-rule argument cannot alone carry the day. Cf. Ex Parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 95 (1807) (Marshall, C.J.) (―It has been urged, that in strict grammatical construction, [the qualifying or modifying phrase] refer[s] to the last antecedent, which is, ‗all other writs not specially provided for by statute.‘ This criticism may be correct, and is not entirely without its influence; but the sound construction which the court thinks it safer to adopt, is, that the true sense of the words is to be determined by the nature of the provision, and by the context.‖). The statute does not clearly answer the question of crucial importance to this case: whether all of the instruments listed must either be capable of expelling a projectile or be readily convertible to do so. Therefore, we conclude that § 11-47-2(3) is ambiguous.', 'The sections of the Firearms Act under review are penal in nature. Therefore, the rule of lenity compels us to resolve this ambiguity ―in favor of the party upon whom a penalty is to be imposed.‖ Clark, 974 A.2d at 571 (quoting Smith, 766 A.2d at 924); see also Smith, 766 A.2d at 924 (―When the meaning of a criminal statute is ambiguous, the policy of lenity in the construction of criminal statutes requires that the less harsh of two possible meanings be adopted.‖ quoting State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 925 (R.I. 1980)). Application of the rule of lenity in this context necessitates rejection of the state‘s last-antecedent-rule argument and requires our holding that a ―firearm‖ must either have the capability to expel a projectile or be readily convertible to do so. See Bass, 404 U.S. at 347-48 (invoking the rule of lenity after rejecting the interpretation called for by the last antecedent rule).', 'The state argues that its interpretation is consistent with the legislative intent behind the Firearms Act. In its brief, the state asserts that ―[t]he danger that a pistol poses is not necessarily', '- 19 - conditioned on whether it is operable or may readily be converted to operability. To the contrary, the mere sight or brandishing of a handgun—operable or not— * * * could very easily escalate the risk of deadly violence.‖ This argument is misplaced for several reasons.', 'For one thing, the notion that the intent behind the Firearms Act was to regulate possession and use of inoperable instruments that could escalate the risk of deadly violence when seen or brandished is belied by both the legislative history of this comprehensive statutory regime and this Court‘s explanation of the intent behind this enactment: ―A careful review of the Firearms Act in its entirety reveals an orderly statutory scheme designed to regulate the possession and use of an array of weapons, including pistols, rifles and other deadly weapons.‖ Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 1045 (R.I. 2004) (emphasis added). For another thing, even if the General Assembly intended to reach instruments that cannot expel a projectile or be readily converted to do so, it was incumbent upon the General Assembly to express that intent clearly and unambiguously. It did not do so in § 11-47-2(3), and the rule of lenity requires us to resolve the resulting ambiguity in favor of the criminal defendant.', 'B. Secondary Arguments', 'Although the state‘s primary argument is that the last antecedent rule controls the interpretation of § 11-47-2(3), it offers two secondary arguments to support its position. First, the state argues that, at least with respect to ―pistol[s],‖ the trial justice‘s interpretation imposes a prerequisite that the General Assembly eschewed in § 11-47-2(8). Second, the state contends that the last sentence of § 11-47-2(3), which provides that ―[t]he frame or receiver of the weapon shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this section[,]‖ is inconsistent with the trial justice‘s interpretation of the first sentence. We address each argument in turn.', '- 20 -', 'In two sentences in its brief, the state asserts that, because the General Assembly eschewed any requirement that a ―pistol‖ be operable or readily convertible to operability in § 11-47-2(8), an interpretation of § 11-47-2(3) requiring all of the delineated instruments to either have the capability to expel a projectile or be readily convertible to do so would render the Firearms Act internally inconsistent. The trial justice disagreed, concluding that a pistol ―must be capable of expelling a projectile or be readily able to be converted to expel a projectile.‖ On appeal, the state offers no extended discussion of the interplay between § 11-47-2(3) and (8).', 'We are in full agreement with the trial justice.', 'Section 11-47-2(8), which defines ―pistol,‖ provides that ―‗[p]istol‘ includes any pistol or revolver, and any shotgun, rifle, or similar weapon with overall length less than twenty-six inches (26‖), but does not include any pistol or revolver designed for the use of blank cartridges only.‖ Nothing in the text of § 11-47- 2(8) answers the question of whether a ―pistol‖ must either be capable of firing a projectile or be readily convertible to do so. Rather, we are convinced that the thrust of this section relates to handguns and concealable instruments. The section characterizes the size of the instruments that constitute ―pistol[s]‖ for purposes of the Firearms Act without purporting to modify § 11-47- 2(3)‘s requirement that ―firearm[s]‖ must either be capable of expelling a projectile or be readily convertible to operability. That portion of § 11-47-2(8) that defines ―pistol‖ to include ―any pistol‖ clearly is of no assistance. However, the dictionary definition of the term ―pistol‖ demonstrates that it is a relatively small, easily concealable firearm, commonly known as a handgun. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1343 (5th ed. 2011) (defining ―pistol‖ as ―[a] firearm designed to be held and fired with one hand‖). Similarly, although the Firearms Act does not define the term ―revolver,‖ the dictionary definition of that term reveals that it too is a small, pistol-like weapon. See id. at 1504 (defining ―revolver‖ as ―[a]', '- 21 - pistol having a revolving cylinder with several cartridge chambers that may be fired in succession‖). Finally, the remaining portion of the Firearms Act‘s definition of ―pistol‖—―any shotgun, rifle, or similar weapon with overall length less than twenty-six inches (26‖),‖ § 11-47- 2(8)—relates solely to the size of the instrument.', 'After examining § 11-47-2(8) (defining ―pistol‖) in conjunction with § 11-47-2(3) (defining ―firearm‖), we are of the opinion that the definition of ―pistol‖ contained in § 11-47- 2(8) is meant to supplement, and not supplant, the definition of ―firearm‖ in § 11-47-2(3). In other words, for reasons discussed at length, supra, under § 11-47-2(3), all ―firearm[s],‖ including ―pistol[s],‖ must be capable of firing a projectile to fall within the purview of the Firearms Act. A ―pistol‖ under the Firearms Act must either have the capacity to fire a bullet or be readily convertible to do so, although that requirement comes from the inclusion of ―pistol‖ in the definition of ―firearm‖ in § 11-47-2(3), and not from § 11-47-2(8)‘s further amplification of the term ―pistol.‖ This interpretation is not only the most sensible understanding of § 11-47-2(3) and (8), but also is most consistent with the overarching purpose of the Firearms Act—to regulate the possession and use of deadly weapons. See Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1045 (―A careful review of the Firearms Act in its entirety reveals an orderly statutory scheme designed to regulate the possession and use of an array of weapons, including pistols, rifles and other deadly weapons.‖ (Emphasis added.)). Therefore, the trial justice correctly recognized that ―any pistol that cannot expel a projectile or is not readily able to be converted to expel a projectile is not covered under the statute.‖', 'We do not suggest that there is no basis for alternative interpretations of § 11-47-2(8). One could argue, as the state appears to, that the text of § 11-47-2(8) alone makes clear that a ―pistol‖ need not be operable or readily convertible to operability in order to qualify as a ―pistol‖', '- 22 - or ―firearm‖ under the Firearms Act: ―‗[p]istol‘ includes any pistol or revolver, and any shotgun, rifle, or similar weapon with overall length less than twenty-six inches (26‖) * * *,‖ irrespective of capability to fire a bullet. (Emphasis added.) This argument strikes us as overly simplistic. For starters, the first four words of § 11-47-2(8) create uncertainty; ―‗[p]istol‘ includes any pistol,‖ but the term is not actually defined. In addition, § 11-47-2(8) also employs the terms ―revolver,‖ ―shotgun,‖ ―rifle‖ and ―similar weapon.‖ None of these terms is defined in the Firearms Act, yet all are similar in one crucial respect: one would normally associate the capability of expelling a projectile with each item. To hold otherwise ignores both the common understanding of the undefined terms ―pistol,‖ ―revolver,‖ ―shotgun‖ and ―rifle‖ and the fact that § 11-47-2(8) itself makes no attempt to address operability one way or the other. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that § 11-47-2(3) requires that all ―firearm[s],‖ including pistols, either be capable of expelling a projectile or be readily convertible to do so, and that § 11-47-2(8) does not modify this requirement with respect to ―pistol[s].‖', 'We note that our interpretation is consistent with this Court‘s jurisprudence under § 11- 47-8(a), which prohibits, inter alia, carrying a pistol or revolver without a license. In State v. Benevides, 425 A.2d 77, 79-80 (R.I. 1981), this Court recognized that operability of the pistol or revolver is an element of a prosecution brought under § 11-47-8(a). In that case, two Cranston police detectives observed the defendant, who was driving a vehicle at the time, hand to a passenger ―a dark pipelike object,‖ which the passenger promptly threw out the window. Benevides, 425 A.2d at 79. When the detectives recovered the object, which turned out to be a .22-caliber pistol, it was in multiple pieces. Id. at 78-79. The detectives reassembled the .22 and test-fired it; the weapon ―was found to be inoperable because the locking mechanism was broken.‖ Id. at 79. At trial, a detective opined that the pistol was inoperable as a result of being', '- 23 - thrown from a moving vehicle and colliding with a telephone pole, since there were two rounds of ammunition in the pistol‘s clip and the pistol had a firing pin. Id. The defendant‘s motion for judgment of acquittal based on ―insufficient evidence to establish the element of operability as to the weapon‖ was denied; after he was convicted of carrying a pistol without a license in a motor vehicle in violation of § 11-47-8(a), he pressed this same argument on appeal. Benevides, 425 A.2d at 78-79.', 'This Court affirmed and addressed the issue of the quantum of proof necessary to establish the pistol‘s operability, declaring that the detective‘s testimony was sufficient to satisfy this element and that it ultimately was a jury question:', '―Detective Sergeant Saccoccia testified that the pistol in his', 'opinion was rendered inoperable upon contact with the telephone', 'pole. His reason for believing that the gun was operable prior to', 'the impact was both reasonable and rational especially in view of', 'the fact that he observed the pistol leave the car in one piece.', 'Furthermore, he testified that the pistol had two live rounds of', 'ammunition in the clip, which fact would likewise support the', 'proposition that the pistol was operable prior to impact. Therefore,', 'we are of the opinion that there were sufficient facts from which a', 'reasonable and rational inference could be drawn that the weapon', 'was operable before it was thrown from the vehicle, especially', 'when such evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the', 'state. Accordingly, the trial justice committed no error in denying', 'defendant‘s motion for judgment of acquittal.‖ Benevides, 425', 'A.2d at 80 (emphasis added).', 'The above-quoted language demonstrates that operability of the pistol or revolver is an essential element of a prosecution under § 11-47-8(a); if it were not, this Court in Benevides would not have addressed whether sufficient evidence of operability was produced to survive a motion for judgment of acquittal. Although § 11-47-8(a) does not require explicitly that the ―pistol or revolver‖ be operable,13 the necessity of proving this element implicitly was 13', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-8(a) provides, in pertinent part, that:', '- 24 - recognized in Benevides in accordance with § 11-47-8(a)‘s use of the term ―pistol,‖ as that term is defined in § 11-47-2(8).', 'Additionally, in a unique approach to statutory interpretation, the state also assails the trial justice‘s interpretation of the first sentence of § 11-47-2(3) as inconsistent with the second sentence of that provision, which provides that ―[t]he frame or receiver of the weapon shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this section.‖ The state argues that ―[i]t is incongruous to suggest that the first [sentence] of [§ 11-47-2(3)] requires that a pistol and the other listed weapons be operable or be readily converted to operability when the final sentence states that the frame or receiver of one of those weapons alone qualifies as a firearm.‖', 'The state‘s suggestion that the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3) should control our interpretation of the first sentence strikes us as a backwards approach to statutory interpretation. As discussed above, when the General Assembly enacted the Firearms Act in 1927, there could be little doubt that only instruments that could expel a projectile qualified as ―firearm[s],‖ and the General Assembly‘s inclusion of the modifying language twenty-three years later did not abrogate this requirement. The ―frame or receiver‖ sentence of § 11-47-2(3) was not added until 1975, nearly fifty years after enactment of the Firearms Act. See P.L. 1975, ch. 278, § 1.', '―No person shall, without a license or permit issued as provided in §§ 11-', '47-11, 11-47-12 and 11-47-18, carry a pistol or revolver in any vehicle or', 'conveyance or on or about his or her person whether visible or concealed, except', 'in his or her dwelling house or place of business or on land possessed by him or', 'her or as provided in §§ 11-47-9 and 11-47-10. The provisions of these sections', 'shall not apply to any person who is the holder of a valid license or permit issued', 'by the licensing authority of another state, or territory of the United States, or', 'political subdivision of the state or territory, allowing him or her to carry a pistol', 'or revolver in any vehicle or conveyance or on or about his or her person whether', 'visible or concealed, provided the person is merely transporting the firearm', 'through the state in a vehicle or other conveyance without any intent on the part', 'of the person to detain him or herself or remain within the state of Rhode Island.‖', '- 25 - Notably, although the General Assembly also added the second half of the modifying language to the first sentence—―or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile‖—nothing in that amendment altered the definition of ―firearm‖ contained in the first sentence of § 11-47-2(3) with respect to the requirement that the instrument either be operable or be readily convertible to operability. We therefore reject the state‘s argument that, because the second sentence contains no explicit requirement that the ―frame or receiver‖ either be operable or be readily convertible to operability to constitute a ―firearm,‖ that requirement also does not apply to the items listed in the first sentence. An amendment passed nearly fifty years after the enactment of a statute characterized by patchwork development cannot be read as signaling such a paradigm shift by sheer implication. See National Association of Home Builders, 551 U.S. at 664 n.8; Welden, 377 U.S. at 103 n.12; Sierra Club, 820 F.2d at 522.', 'C. Frame or Receiver', 'We address one additional aspect of the trial justice‘s interpretation of § 11-47-2(3): his determination that a frame or receiver of a weapon must either be capable of expelling a projectile or be readily convertible to do so in order to qualify as a ―firearm.‖ The state argues that the trial justice‘s interpretation of the second sentence is erroneous because ―the plain and unambiguous language of the statute‖ contains no requirement that a frame or receiver must either have the capability to expel a projectile or be readily convertible to do so. We are unconvinced.', 'We reject the state‘s assertion that the ―frame or receiver‖ language set forth in § 11-47- 2(3) is clear and unambiguous. Although that sentence may emanate the illusion of clarity at first glance, the state overlooks the use of the phrase ―the weapon‖ in that provision. Under the last sentence of § 11-47-2(3), not every frame or receiver is a firearm; only ―[t]he frame or', '- 26 - receiver of the weapon‖ qualifies as a firearm. Section 11-47-2(3) (emphasis added). The phrase ―the weapon‖ is left undefined by the Firearms Act, but it must have some meaning. See West v. McDonald, 18 A.3d 526, 538 (R.I. 2011) (―When we interpret a statute or ordinance, ‗[w]e presume that the [Legislature] intended to attach significance to every word, sentence and provision of a statute.‘‖ quoting Retirement Board of the Employees‘ Retirement System of Rhode Island v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 279 (R.I. 2004)). The legislative history of the Firearms Act readily demonstrates that the phrase ―the weapon‖ refers to those instruments defined as ―firearm[s]‖ in the first sentence of § 11-47-2(3).', 'The ―frame or receiver‖ language was first added in 1975 and that sentence then read, ―The frame or receiver of any such weapon shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this section.‖ P.L. 1975, ch. 278, § 1 (emphasis added). The highlighted language makes clear that ―any such weapon‖ refers to only those instruments constituting ―firearm[s]‖ in the preceding sentence. This language remained in place until the 2000 Reenactment of title 11, when the language slightly was restyled as follows: ―The frame or receiver of those weapons shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this section.‖ Section 11-47-2(3) (2000) (emphasis added). Under this version, as under the prior language, ―those weapons‖ clearly refers only to those instruments that fall within the definition of ―firearms‖ in the preceding sentence of § 11-47-2(3). The final change to this language appears in the 2002 Reenactment of title 11. The second sentence of that version of § 11-47-2(3) is identical to the current version of that sentence. It reads, ―The frame or receiver of the weapon shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this section.‖ Section 11-47-2(3) (2002) (emphasis added).', 'Therefore, the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3) is not the model of clarity that the state suggests; when the meaning of the phrase ―the weapon‖ has been illuminated, the sentence in', '- 27 - effect reads as follows: ―The frame or receiver of [any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, ‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ or other instrument from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile] shall be construed as a firearm under the provisions of this section.‖ Section 11-47-2(3). To say that the language of the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3) does not impose a requirement of operability or ready convertibility to operability ignores that the sentence‘s scope is constrained by reference back to the preceding sentence, which, for reasons discussed above, imposes such a requirement.', 'In United States v. Wonschik, 353 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2004), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted the definition of ―machinegun‖ in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b). The structure of that definition is very analogous to the structure of the definition of ―firearm‖ under our Firearms Act; 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b) provides:', '―The term ‗machinegun‘ means any weapon which shoots,', 'is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot,', 'automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a', 'single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the', 'frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and', 'intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed', 'and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,', 'and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be', 'assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control', 'of a person.‖ (Emphasis added.) The Wonschik Court acknowledged that this definition was not crystal clear:', '―There does appear to be a confusing circularity to the', 'treatment of ‗machinegun‘ in § 5845(b). The statute offers a', 'definition of machinegun as ‗any weapon which shoots, is', 'designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot,', 'automatically,‘ and then goes on to state that ‗the term shall also', 'include‘ the frame or receiver of a machinegun, parts designed and', 'intended to convert a weapon into a machinegun, and parts from', 'which a machinegun can be assembled. Thus, the statute seems', 'circularly to say that a ‗machinegun‘ is, among other things, a', '‗receiver of a machinegun‘ or ‗parts that can be made into a', '- 28 -', 'machinegun.‘‖ Wonschik, 353 F.3d at 1197-98 (quoting 26 U.S.C.', '§ 5845(b)).', 'However, the Tenth Circuit resolved this confusion by reasoning that the phrase ―any such weapon‖ in the second sentence referred back to the primary definition of ―machinegun‖ contained in the first sentence:', '―However, any resulting confusion can be resolved through close', 'attention to the subsection‘s grammatical structure. Subsection (b),', 'as noted above, provides a primary definition of the term', '‗machinegun‘ and then sets apart this primary definition with a', 'period. A new sentence then states that the ‗term shall also', 'include‘ receivers or parts bearing some relation to a', '‗machinegun.‘ This structure suggests that, where ‗machinegun‘', 'or ‗such weapon‘ appears in the second part of the subsection, as', 'an attribute of receivers or parts, the statute implicitly substitutes in', 'the primary definition of ‗machinegun‘ provided in the first', 'sentence. This reading provides a consistent definition for', '‗machinegun‘ and ‗such weapon‘ (namely, ‗any weapon which', 'shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot,', 'automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a', 'single function of the trigger‘) each time these terms appear within', 'the subsection. Thus, the phrase ‗a combination of parts from', 'which a machinegun can be assembled‘ actually means ‗a', 'combination of parts from which [any weapon which shoots, is', 'designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot,', 'automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a', 'single function of the trigger] can be assembled.‘‖ Wonschik, 353', 'F.3d at 1198 (quoting 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b)).', 'Returning to our own Firearms Act, we are convinced that, because the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3) contemplates only the frame or receiver of a ―machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, ‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ or other instrument from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile,‖ and because those instruments identified in the first sentence of § 11-47-2(3) must either be capable of expelling a projectile or be readily convertible to do so, the trial justice correctly determined that the frame or receiver must either be able to expel a projectile or be readily convertible to do so in order to', '- 29 - qualify as a firearm. If a frame or receiver of an instrument cannot either expel a projectile or be readily converted to operability, then the instrument is not a ―firearm‖ under our Firearms Act, since the instrument would necessarily likewise lack the capacity to expel a projectile or be readily convertible to expel a projectile.14 Such a frame or receiver would therefore not be ―[t]he frame or receiver of the weapon,‖ and it would not constitute a firearm under the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3). (Emphasis added.)', 'D. Conclusion', 'For all of the reasons articulated above, we hold that, in order for an instrument to constitute a ―firearm‖ under § 11-47-2(3) of the Firearms Act, irrespective of whether that instrument is specifically delineated in § 11-47-2(3) or is a mere frame or receiver, the instrument must either have the capability to expel a projectile or be readily convertible to do 14', 'The dissent asserts that ―‗frames‘ and ‗receivers‘ * * *, by definition, are incapable of expelling projectiles.‖ The record in this case is unclear on whether a frame or receiver can itself expel a projectile. The source upon which the dissent relies for its conclusion does not explicitly specify one way or the other whether a ―frame‖ or ―receiver‖ is capable of expelling a projectile. See R.A. Steindler, The Firearms Dictionary 107, 189 (1970) (explaining that, ―in usage, [the term ‗frame‘] has come to mean almost exclusively the forging or casting of a swing-out cylinder revolver[;] [t]he frame consists of the housing for the cylinder, the lockwork, the grip straps, & at its forward end a threaded housing for the barrel‖ and defining ―receiver‖ as ―that part of a rifle or shotgun (excepting hinged frame guns) that houses the bolt, firing pin, mainspring, the trigger group, & the magazine or ammunition feed system‖).', 'Even if the dissent is correct that frames and receivers are incapable of firing, this circumstance does not impact our interpretation of the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3). Our interpretation of the term ―firearm‖ makes clear that either the present capability to expel a projectile or the ability to readily be converted to expel a projectile, but not both, is required. Therefore, even if a frame or receiver cannot itself expel a projectile—a determination we cannot make from this record—it still may readily be converted to expel a projectile; indeed, in the typical case, all that will be required to render a frame or receiver capable of firing a bullet is to assemble the necessary internal components. Additionally, even if a frame or receiver lacks present operability, we cannot overlook that the second sentence of § 11-47-2(3) covers only those frames and receivers of ―the weapon,‖ which, as we discuss above, refers to those instruments delineated as ―firearm[s]‖ in the first sentence of § 11-47-2(3). That reference back is significant.', '- 30 - so.15 Because the trial justice correctly interpreted this provision, we affirm the denial of the state‘s motion in limine.', 'II', 'Adjudication of Probation Violation', 'In the portion of his brief arguing that the probation-violation adjudication should be vacated, defendant relies primarily on his contention that possession of the revolver did not violate the Firearms Act. At oral argument, defense counsel took a somewhat different tack, vigorously arguing that, if the Firearms Act was not violated, only the allegation of eluding the police would remain, which, by itself, would not warrant a ten-year sentence. Therefore, counsel requested that we vacate the ten-year sentence imposed by the trial justice and remand the matter with instructions that a lesser sentence be imposed. We decline counsel‘s request.', 'It is well settled that the ―sole purpose of a probation violation hearing is for the trial justice to determine whether the conditions of probation‖—―[k]eeping the peace and remaining on good behavior‖—have been violated.

In conducting this task, we remain mindful that ―[a]ssessing the credibility of a witness in a probation violation hearing is a function of the hearing justice, not this Court.‖ Id. at 49 (quoting Waite, 813 A.2d at 985).', 'Before this Court, defendant contends that the revolver qualifies as an ―[a]ntique firearm‖ under § 11-47-25 and therefore falls outside the proscriptions of the Firearms Act.16 We reject this contention. To be sure, when it defined ―[a]ntique firearm[s],‖ the General Assembly specifically incorporated the definition that is codified in federal law.', 'Section 11-47-2(1) (―‗Antique firearm‘ is defined as that term is defined under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 921.‖).17 It is undisputed that the revolver found in defendant‘s possession qualifies as an ―[a]ntique firearm‖ under that definition. This circumstance does not, however, end the analysis. 16', 'The state claims that this issue is waived because it was not raised at the close of evidence during the violation hearing. However, it was raised at the beginning of the hearing, and the trial justice did in fact rule on it. Therefore, we conclude that the issue was preserved. 17', 'Under federal law, the term ―antique firearm‖ is defined as:', '―(A) any firearm (including any firearm with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion', 'cap, or similar type of ignition system) manufactured in or before 1898; or', '―(B) any replica of any firearm described in subparagraph (A) if such replica–', '―(i) is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or conventional', 'centerfire fixed ammunition, or', '- 32 -', 'The General Assembly did not exempt all ―antique firearms‖ from the Firearms Act‘s reach; only ―antique firearms unsuitable for use‖ are exempted.

The trial justice agreed with this position, and so do we.', 'The trial justice found that, because the damaged cylinder on the revolver could be replaced in a matter of minutes without difficulty, defendant‘s revolver was indeed suitable for use and, therefore, did not qualify for the exemption for antique firearms. There is ample evidence in the record supporting this conclusion. Robert A. Hathaway (Hathaway), a seasoned firearms expert, and Stephen Springer (Springer), a criminal investigator for the Attorney General and a former Providence police officer, both testified as to the ease with which a working cylinder could be inserted into the revolver to make it operable and therefore suitable for use. Additionally, a video, which was only about one minute in length, was played in open', '―(ii) uses rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition', 'which is no longer manufactured in the United States and which is', 'not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade;', 'or', '―(C) any muzzle loading rifle, muzzle loading shotgun, or muzzle loading pistol,', 'which is designed to use black powder, or a black powder substitute, and which', 'cannot use fixed ammunition.

Furthermore, Hathaway and Springer testified that a replacement cylinder was easily obtainable via the Internet or from a retailer for approximately $80.', 'Therefore, there is sufficient evidence demonstrating that the revolver recovered from the floor of defendant‘s vehicle was suitable for use. We therefore see no error in the trial justice‘s ruling that the revolver did not fit within the antique-firearms exemption to the Firearms Act. For the same reasons, the record provides ample support for the trial justice‘s conclusion that the revolver could be readily converted to expel a projectile and thus qualified as a ―firearm‖ and a ―pistol‖ under the act.', 'Additionally, the trial justice determined that it was defendant who was in possession of the revolver. This conclusion was based on his finding that Washington lied about bringing the gun into the car in an effort to protect his half-brother. First, the trial justice found Washington‘s testimony to be wholly inconsistent with his prior statements to Det. Rawnsley. Second, he rejected Washington‘s story that he purchased the revolver on a dark night from an unknown person. Ultimately, the trial justice found that defendant, and not Washington, possessed the revolver. Therefore, the trial justice‘s determination that defendant violated the conditions of his probation by carrying a revolver without a license and possessing a firearm despite a previous felony conviction was neither arbitrary nor capricious.', 'We note that the trial justice‘s alternative basis for adjudicating defendant a probation violator also is unassailable. The trial justice weighed the credibility of the witnesses and credited the testimony of Det. Rawnsley and Ptlm. Castro and Chin. He found that Ptlm. Castro did not have his weapon drawn when he first approached defendant‘s car. He further found the testimony of defendant, Stokes and Washington to be inconsistent and untruthful. The trial justice rejected defendant‘s story that he ―blacked out‖ before speeding away from the officers', '- 34 - because defendant clearly recalled fumbling with his cell phone at the same time. The trial justice ultimately found that defendant knew that he was being stopped by uniformed police officers and that he deliberately attempted to evade them because he knew that there was a gun in the car. In his bench decision, the trial justice concluded that the act of eluding the police, in and of itself, was a sufficient ground for a finding that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his probation. This conclusion was neither arbitrary nor capricious.', 'Based on the trial justice‘s credibility determinations, and a thorough review of the record, we discern no error in the trial justice‘s finding that the defendant had failed to keep the peace and remain on good behavior and, thus, had violated the terms of his probation. Furthermore, in light of the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that the defendant was on probation for a homicide, it is our opinion that it was within the discretion of the trial justice to sentence him as he did. See State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 697 (R.I. 2013) (―[T]he [trial justice] has wide discretion when determining the proper sentence to exact upon a probation violator[.]‖ quoting State v. Lancellotta, 35 A.3d 863, 869 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the trial justice‘s adjudication of probation violation and his denial of the state‘s motion in limine. The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Flaherty, J., and Indeglia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although we agree that the defendant‘s adjudication of probation violation should be affirmed, we respectfully dissent from the majority‘s analysis and interpretation of the Firearms Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 47 of title 11 (the Firearms Act or act).', 'Specifically, in our opinion, § 11-47-2(3) (defining', '- 35 - ―firearm‖) is unambiguous and does not require that the specifically enumerated weapons—as well as the frame or receiver of those weapons—have the capability of expelling a projectile, or be readily converted to do so, in order to constitute a firearm.', 'Section 11-47-2(3) defines the following weapons as firearms: ―any machine gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, air pistol, ‗blank gun,‘ ‗BB gun,‘ or other instrument from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile * * *.‖ The majority concludes that, if the General Assembly had intended to include within the definition of a firearm weapons that cannot expel a projectile or be readily converted to do so, it did not express that intent clearly and unambiguously, and therefore, the rule of lenity must be applied. We disagree. Although we concede that this statute is not a model of artful draftsmanship, we conclude that § 11-47-2(3) unambiguously indicates that the modifying phrase ―from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile‖ applies only to the term ―other instrument‖ and not to its counterparts enumerated in the act. Below, we explain our rationale in reaching this conclusion.', 'I', 'The Legislative History', 'The majority correctly points out that in 1927, when the General Assembly enacted the Firearms Act, it defined a firearm as ―any machine gun‖ (any weapon which shoots automatically) ―or pistol‖ (which excluded those weapons designed for the use of blank cartridges only). P.L. 1927, ch. 1052, § 1. However, in 1950, the General Assembly then amended the Firearms Act to explicitly include blank guns—which are per se incapable of expelling projectiles—within the definition of ―firearm.‖ P.L. 1950, ch. 2452, § 1; see R.A. Steindler, The Firearms Dictionary 55 (1970) (explaining that blank guns expel blank cartridges,', '- 36 - which ―contain[ ] a special propellant powder, but no bullet‖). Because a blank gun does not (and cannot) expel a projectile and cannot readily be converted to do so, its inclusion within the definition of a firearm undercuts the majority‘s conclusion that a weapon must meet those requirements to constitute a firearm.', 'We disagree with the majority‘s contention that ―[b]lank guns can, in some circumstances, readily be converted to expel a projectile.‖ First, the cases that the majority cites to support their assertion deal with starter guns, and the majority assumes that a starter gun is identical to a blank gun. Even if we ignore this inconsistency, we do not believe that there are any circumstances in which a blank gun could readily be converted to fire a projectile. See State v. Waugh, No. 35362, 1977 WL 201120 at *2 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 6, 1977) (where a statute defined the term ―firearm‖ as ―any deadly weapon capable of expelling or propelling one or more projectiles * * * and any firearm which is inoperable but which can readily be rendered operable, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2923.11(B) (LexisNexis 1975), the court held that ―[c]learly, a ‗blank gun‘ is not a ‗firearm‘ under the above statutory definition‖).', 'Likewise, in another amendment, in 1975, the General Assembly also added the terms ―frame[s]‖ and ―receiver[s]‖—items that, by definition, are incapable of expelling projectiles—to the definition of a firearm. P.L. 1975, ch. 278, § 1. Indeed, a frame or receiver is the mere skeleton of a weapon, to which all the other parts attach. See The Firearms Dictionary at 107-08, 189. Thus, although initially the embrace of the Firearms Act included only those weapons which were deemed operable, the succeeding amendments to that act reveal that the General Assembly no longer intended to include a weapon‘s capability of expelling a projectile or its readiness to do so as a prerequisite to constitute a firearm. Moreover, those amendments belie the majority‘s assertion that ―[t]he legislative history from 1927 onward does not suggest an', '- 37 - intent to broaden the scope of the Firearms Act to encompass instruments that are incapable of firing or may have been rendered permanently inoperable.‖ Instead, although the Firearms Act as initially drafted in 1927 included only those weapons which were deemed operable, the succeeding amendments to that act reveal that the enumerated weapons need not be capable of expelling a projectile to constitute a firearm.', 'We believe that this reading of § 11-47-2(3) is more harmonious with the design of the Firearms Act as a whole as well as its purpose and underlying policy. See Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011) (It is crucial to statutory interpretation that we ―consider the entire statute as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections.‖ quoting Sorenson v. Colibri Corp., 650 A.2d 125, 128 (R.I. 1994)).', 'Indeed, the Firearms Act distinguishes the definition and use of a ―firearm,‖ which includes both operable and inoperable weapons, from the definition and use of a ―pistol,‖ which includes operable weapons and specifically excludes inoperable weapons. See § 11-47-2(3), (8). The more-expansive term, ―firearm,‖ is then used to restrict possession of both operable and inoperable weapons by fugitives and those who have been convicted of crimes of violence, while the narrower term, ―pistol,‖ is used to restrict possession of operable weapons by individual members of the general public without a proper license. See §§ 11-47-5, 11-47-8(a).', 'This distinction reflects a reasoned policy of keeping firearms out of the hands of felons and fugitives, whether or not those weapons are capable of expelling a projectile. 19 Indeed, the 19', 'This policy is further reflected in G.L. 1956 § 11-47-6, which prohibits ―[m]ental incompetents, drug addicts, and drunkards‖ from the possession of a firearm, and in § 11-47-7, which prohibits ―unnaturalized foreign born person[s] who entered the United States in violation of the laws of the United States or, having legally entered the United States in a lawful manner,', '- 38 - brandishing of a blank gun or the display of a frame or receiver is indistinguishable from that of a gun that expels bullets. By way of example, one can envision the scene of a robbery: someone brandishes a blank gun, demanding money. The person on the other end of that gun is hardly in a position to ask the aggressor or to independently discern whether that weapon is able to expel bullets. The risk of deadly violence is the same whether or not the gun shoots bullets or blanks—the victim could, in turn, fire a gun in self-defense, or a third party could intervene. Either way, the brandishing of a blank gun or the display of a frame or receiver can cause just as much societal harm as that of a gun that expels bullets.', 'In light of the fact that ―[t]he [General Assembly] is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the [C]ourt will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible,‖ Swain v. Estate of Tyre, 57 A.3d 283, 288 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 571 (R.I. 2009)), we cannot ignore its decision to include the term ―blank gun‖ and the term ―frame or receiver‖ within the definition of firearm. This inclusion clearly shows that the General Assembly did not intend that a weapon be operable in order to constitute a firearm.', 'II', 'The Rule of Last Antecedent', 'Although we believe that the Firearms Act is unambiguous, and that we, therefore, need not look beyond its plain language, our conclusion is further supported by the doctrine of construction known as the rule of last antecedent. That canon ―provides that ‗referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. * * * Thus, a proviso is usually construed to apply to the provision or clause but now remain[ ] in the United States in violation of the laws of the United States * * *,‖ from the possession of a firearm.', '- 39 - immediately preceding it.‘‖ State v. Brown, 486 A.2d 595, 600 (R.I. 1985) (quoting 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction, § 47.33 at 245 (4th ed. 1984)); see also Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) (―[A] limiting clause or phrase * * * should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows * * *.‖); People v. O‘Neal, 228 P.3d 211, 215 (Colo. App. 2009), cert. denied, 2010 WL 1436208 (Colo. Apr. 12, 2010) (en banc). Indeed, the majority readily concedes that the rule of last antecedent ―create[s] an inference of meaning consistent with sound rules of grammar.‖', 'Recently, in O‘Neal, 228 P.3d at 215, the Colorado Court of Appeals employed the rule of last antecedent when construing a similar firearms statute that was applied to similar facts.20 In that case, the defendant, a previous offender, was found guilty of possession of a firearm. Id. at 212. The gun in question, which appeared to have been run over by a car, lacked grips, had an inoperative firing pin, had a misplaced trigger bar, and had a crack in the base of the handle that prevented it from being loaded. In defining the term ―firearm,‖ the Colorado statute enumerated a list of weapons, similar to that provided in § 11-47-2(3), followed by the modifying phrase ―capable or intended to be capable of discharging bullets, cartridges, or other explosive charges.‖ Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-1-901(3)(h) (West 2004). In construing the statute, guided by the rule of last antecedent, the O‘Neal court held that the modifying phrase applied only to the last item enumerated in the statute (―other instrument or device‖) and not to any of the previously enumerated items within that statute.', 'O‘Neal, 228 P.3d at 213-14.', 'Therefore, the court concluded that a gun deemed incapable of discharging bullets, cartridges, or other explosive charges constituted a firearm as prescribed under the statute. Id. 20', 'The Colorado statute provides that ―‗[f]irearm‘ means any handgun, automatic, revolver, pistol, rifle, shotgun, or other instrument or device capable or intended to be capable of discharging bullets, cartridges, or other explosive charges.‖ Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-1- 901(3)(h) (West 2004).', '- 40 -', 'Likewise, it is our opinion that the qualifying language in our own statute (―from which steel or metal projectiles are propelled, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile‖) applies only to the last item enumerated (―other instrument‖). See § 11-47-2(3). Thus, as the rule of last antecedent explains, any of the preceding items delineated in that statute are firearms notwithstanding their ability to propel projectiles.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully dissent from the majority‘s decision affirming the trial justice‘s order denying the state‘s motion in limine.

18,"Providence School Board : v. : Providence Teachers Union, Local 958, : AFT, AFL-CIO.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 9, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The Providence Teachers Union, Local 958, AFT, AFL-CIO (union), appeals from a Superior Court order granting the motion of the Providence School Board (board), to vacate an arbitration award. The union contends that the trial justice erroneously concluded (1) that it did not have standing to pursue a grievance concerning the board‟s change in the calculation of group premium rates for retired teachers (retirees) in the school department‟s health insurance plan (plan) and (2) that the issue of the calculation of group premium rates was not arbitrable. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case are undisputed. The board provides health insurance to both active employees and retirees. Since 1989, in order to calculate the premium costs for the plan,', '-1- underwriters developed working rates; these working rates were calculated by combining all active employees and retirees into a single group. In September 2004, active teachers and retirees began contributing to health insurance costs under the plan; and, for almost two years thereafter, any increase in premium costs was applied equally to active employees and retirees.', 'The landscape changed in the summer of 2006, however, when the underwriters separated active employees and retirees into two groups for purposes of calculating the working rates. This change in formula impacted the degree to which premium costs increased for each group; the premiums for active employees increased by approximately 10 percent, while retirees saw an increase of approximately 55 percent. By letter dated June 29, 2006, School Department Controller Michael D‟Antuono (Controller D‟Antuono) explained to the retirees the rationale for the change in premium-cost calculations, a move that was postponed until August 20, 2006:', '“[V]arious groups (i.e. active * * * school * * * employees) were', 'required to contribute much more to the system than they actually', 'consumed in claims. Also, the City [of Providence] learned that', 'the retiree group did not contribute nearly as much into the system', 'as they exhausted in claims. Due to the fact that retirees use the', 'system at a much higher rate than others [sic] groups there must,', 'inevitably, be an increase in the healthcare contribution of', 'retirees.”', 'In response, the union filed a grievance on September 25, 2006, protesting the difference in the increase of premium costs for retirees compared with the more modest increase in premium costs for active employees.1 The union contended that the board‟s action violated three provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) between the board and the union: 1', 'Although the record does not contain a copy of the union‟s grievance, the arbitrator stated the following with respect to the grievance: “On September 25, 2006, the [u]nion submitted a grievance protesting what it termed the increased cost for health care insurance for retirees beyond „the “Group Rate” for active teachers.‟” At no point in this case has the union challenged the arbitrator‟s characterization of its grievance.', '-2- Appendix C (relating to medical coverage); Article 19 (concerning past practice); and Article 17- 6 (barring, inter alia, age discrimination). The dispute was submitted to arbitration.2', 'Before the arbitrator, the board, relying on our decision in Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379 (R.I. 2007), argued that the union had no standing to represent the retirees because they were not parties to the CBA or members of the bargaining unit. Additionally, the board contended that, because no provision of the contract restricts how the board may calculate insurance rates, the issue of calculation of group premium rates was not arbitrable. The union countered that it did have standing to enforce provisions negotiated when the retirees were still active employees. The union further argued that the issue of calculation of insurance rates was arbitrable and, further, that the clear language of the contract provided that retirees would receive the same coverage that they had when they were active employees.', 'The arbitrator ruled in the union‟s favor. First, he determined that the union had standing to pursue the grievance. The arbitrator pointed to a previous arbitration award between the board and union in 1995, in which the union sought to pursue a grievance challenging the board‟s decision to curtail certain insurance benefits for retirees when they attained a certain age; the board challenged the union‟s standing to pursue a grievance regarding retiree benefits, and the earlier arbitrator concluded that the union had standing. The arbitrator in the current case also found our decision in Arena distinguishable because it involved a situation “where the employer sought to prospectively change benefits for people who had already retired[,]” whereas this case involved the union‟s standing to “arbitrate to enforce a provision negotiated on behalf of people who were then active employees, but who have since retired.” 2', 'The union did not pursue the age-discrimination component of its grievance during the arbitration proceedings.', '-3-', 'On the merits, the arbitrator determined that the board violated the medical-coverage and past-practice provisions of the CBA by failing to include retirees and active employees in a single group when it calculated the healthcare premium rates. He found the provisions of the CBA relating to health insurance coverage for retirees to be ambiguous. Confronted with this ambiguity, the arbitrator turned to past practice to discern the parties‟ mutual intent.', 'He concluded that the union had sustained its burden of proving the existence of a past practice with respect to the meaning and applicability of the phrase “the Providence School Department‟s group premium rate,” which was left undefined in the CBA. Specifically, the arbitrator found as follows:', '“Since 1989, the [b]oard developed working rates for all of the', 'various insurance plans and coverages using a unified group', 'composed of all School Department employees. Never before', 'June[] 2006 did the [b]oard assert that there could be separate', 'group premium rates for active employees and for retirees and their', 'spouses. Up until June[] 2006, there was never any suggestion that', '„the Providence School Department‟s group premium rate‟ meant', 'anything other than the rate developed for the group composed of', 'all active and retired participants in the insurance plans.” The arbitrator determined that this past practice bound the board to calculate the group premium rate using a single group of active employees and retirees. The arbitrator ordered the board to “recalculate the premiums * * * using the unified group and make whole the retirees and spouses for any extra premium charges.”', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-9-18(a), the board moved to vacate the arbitration award in the Superior Court, where it reiterated its positions that the union had no standing to pursue this grievance and that the issue of calculation of the group premium rate was not arbitrable. In opposition to the board‟s motion, the union similarly repeated the arguments it had made during arbitration.', '-4-', 'The trial justice vacated the arbitration award. In so doing, he first concluded that our decision in Arena compelled the conclusion that the union did not have standing to pursue a grievance on behalf of retirees. The trial justice determined that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by concluding to the contrary. The trial justice next identified an alternative basis for vacating the arbitration award: Because the CBA was silent on how the group premium rate was to be calculated, the trial justice declared that the issue of the calculation of that rate was not arbitrable. The union appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that, in the typical case, the judiciary‟s role in the arbitration process is limited.” Drago Custom Interiors, LLC v.

Cumberland School Committee, 45 A.3d 1188, 1192 (R.I. 2012) (quoting North Providence School Committee v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 344 (R.I. 2008)).', '-6-', 'In this case, “the [u]nion submitted a grievance protesting what it termed the increased cost for health care insurance for retirees beyond „the “Group Rate” for active teachers.‟” See footnote 1, supra. It is apparent from the language of the grievance that the union sought to press a claim on behalf of retirees. However, neither the CBA nor our case law permits the union to pursue a grievance on behalf of retirees.', 'Under the CBA between the parties, “[t]he [b]oard recognize[d] the [u]nion as the exclusive bargaining representative for all those persons in the bargaining unit which consists of all certified teaching personnel, long-term substitute teachers, long-term substitute teachers in- pool, home visitors, social workers and nurses but which excludes all administrators and per- diem substitute teachers.” Retirees are not included within the bargaining unit. Similarly, the CBA provides that “[t]he jurisdiction of the [u]nion shall include those persons now or hereafter who perform the duties or functions of the categories of personnel in the bargaining unit.” (Emphasis added.) Clearly, retirees are not “persons now or hereafter” who perform these duties, and, therefore, are not within the union‟s jurisdiction under the CBA. Finally, the CBA defines the term “teacher” in a way that excludes retirees: “The term „teacher‟ as used in this [CBA] means a person employed by the [b]oard in the bargaining unit as described in Article 1.” Retirees are, by definition, no longer “employed by the [b]oard.” In short, then, no provision of the CBA purports to authorize the union to pursue a grievance on behalf of retirees.', 'Correspondingly, our case law affords the union no basis upon which to pursue this grievance. In Arena, 919 A.2d at 384, 387, a number of retired firefighters (the plaintiffs) filed suit in Superior Court, seeking, inter alia, a determination of the appropriate amount of cost-of- living-adjustment (COLA) benefits. After the trial justice determined that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs‟ claim, the International Association of Firefighters', '-7- (firefighters union) and the City of Providence (city) agreed to enter into interest arbitration pursuant to the Fire Fighters Arbitration Act (FFAA), G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 28, to resolve the COLA dispute. Arena, 919 A.2d at 387-88. Significantly, the plaintiffs had not consented to the union‟s representation before the arbitration panel. Id. at 387, 388 n.9. After the arbitration panel rendered a decision, the city argued to the trial justice that she should defer to that decision; the trial justice disagreed, declaring that the Superior Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the plaintiffs‟ claim “and explicitly reject[ing] the arbitration panel‟s authority to determine benefits for already-retired firefighters without their consent.” Id. at 388. The city appealed, contending, inter alia, “that the Superior Court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to determine [the] plaintiffs‟ appropriate COLA benefits because the FFAA [was] the controlling statutory authority for determining unresolved collective-bargaining issues.” Id.', 'This Court disagreed and held that the Superior Court had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs‟ claim. Arena, 919 A.2d at 388. We explained that, because the plaintiffs were “retired firefighters seeking a declaration of their existing rights[,] * * * the FFAA does not apply to [the] plaintiffs‟ claim.” Id. at 389. We noted that “retirees, at least in situations such as the one now before us, cannot be treated as employees * * *.” Id. We identified three concerns that supported our conclusion “that the term „firefighter‟ in the FFAA does not and cannot include retirees”: first, “[t]he ordinary meaning of „firefighter‟ and the definition included in the FFAA [could not] reasonably be construed to include retirees[,]” id.; second, “[t]he dangers against which the FFAA protects are simply not present with regard to retirees[,]” id. at 390; and, “[f]inally, * * * retirees and current employees of the fire department [did] not share a „community of interests‟ with respect to [the] plaintiffs‟ COLA benefits * * *.” Id. This third concern was of paramount importance; we reasoned that “the [firefighters union]', '-8- and the city could conceivably come to an agreement that would adversely affect [the] plaintiffs [in order] to benefit current fire department employees.” Id. We therefore concluded that the “plaintiff retirees cannot be subject to the FFAA‟s mandates.” Id.4', 'We recently relied on our decision in Arena in City of Newport v. Local 1080, International Association of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, 54 A.3d 976, 980-81 (R.I. 2012) (Local 1080). In Local 1080, a collective-bargaining agreement between a firefighters union and the City of Newport (Newport) required Newport to provide health insurance coverage to active firefighters and to make this same coverage “available to retired members of the Newport Fire Department.” Id. at 977. When Newport made changes to the health coverage for both active and retired firefighters, the firefighters union sought to arbitrate two grievances it had filed contesting the changes in coverage provided to retired firefighters. Id. at 977-78. Newport filed a complaint in Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the grievances were not arbitrable. Id. at 978.', 'The trial justice agreed with Newport and declared that the grievances were not arbitrable because “[r]etired firefighters are not firefighters within the embrace of the [collective- bargaining agreement] * * *.” Id. The union petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. Id.', 'We affirmed the trial justice‟s determination that the grievances were not arbitrable.

After examining the FFAA and the collective-bargaining agreement and chronicling our Arena decision, we concluded that “the parties did not intend to arbitrate disputes regarding retiree healthcare,” and we held “that such disputes must be resolved, 4', 'We explained in Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 390 n.11 (R.I. 2007), that retirees were not precluded “from engaging in permissive bargaining with or through their former union and employer.” In City of Newport v. Local 1080, International Association of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, 54 A.3d 976, 981 n.5 (R.I. 2012), we noted that “[s]uch bargaining * * * would require the express assent of the retirees, the bargaining agent, and the municipal officials.” The record in this case is devoid of any such permissive bargaining.', '-9- if at all, judicially rather than through arbitration.” Id. at 982. We determined that several provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement compelled this conclusion, including the provision defining the terms “member,” “employee,” and “fire fighter” in such a way that plainly excluded retired firefighters. Id. at 981.', 'Returning to the case at bar, our decisions in Arena and Local 1080 provide further support for our conclusion that the union cannot pursue this grievance on behalf of the retirees. This CBA, like the collective-bargaining agreement in Local 1080, 54 A.3d at 981, plainly excludes retirees from the bargaining unit, the jurisdiction of the union, and the definition of “teacher.” Additionally, the concern we expressed in Arena, 919 A.2d at 390, about a lack of a “community of interests” between current firefighters and retired firefighters also is present here; the union, which is recognized in the CBA to represent a bargaining unit consisting of active teachers, and the board “could conceivably come to an agreement that would adversely affect [the retirees in order] to benefit current [teachers].” Id. Indeed, the letter from Controller D‟Antuono reveals that it was this very lack of a “community of interests” between active teachers and retirees that led to the change in premium-cost calculation in the first place. The letter explained that active school employees “were required to contribute much more to the system than they actually consumed in claims[,]” while retirees “did not contribute nearly as much into the system as they exhausted in claims.” This disconnect, Controller D‟Antuono explained, was the reason for the change in premium-cost calculation: “Due to the fact that retirees use the system at a much higher rate than others [sic] groups there must, inevitably, be an increase in the healthcare contribution of retirees.”', 'We reject the union‟s attempts to distinguish this case from our decisions in Arena and Local 1080. First, the union argues that this grievance is arbitrable because the union is bringing', '- 10 - it on behalf of active teachers who soon will retire. Alternatively, the union contends that it is pursuing this grievance in its own stead to enforce its own contractually-bargained-for rights; because the grievance procedure of the CBA defines “grievance” as “a complaint or claim by a teacher or the [u]nion filed with or by the [u]nion that an event or condition exists which represents a violation, inequitable application, [or] misinterpretation of this Agreement[,]” (emphasis added), the union asserts that it is permitted to bring a grievance on its own behalf and is exercising that option here.', 'These arguments need not detain us. Because of the precise language of the grievance before the arbitrator—“protesting what [the union] termed the increased cost for health care insurance for retirees * * *”—we need not decide whether, in some other case, the union may pursue a grievance on behalf of active teachers who will eventually retire or in its own stead as a contracting party to the CBA. The issue addressed by this arbitrator belies any suggestion that the union brought this grievance in its own stead or on behalf of active teachers; it clearly brought this grievance on behalf of the retirees—an action that the CBA does not authorize and that our decisions in Arena and Local 1080 foreclose.5', 'Therefore, because the union had no standing to pursue this particular grievance, the grievance was not arbitrable. In concluding otherwise, the arbitrator exceeded his powers. See Local 2409, 925 A.2d at 944 (“An arbitrator exceeds his or her powers if the arbitrator decides an issue that is not arbitrable.”). Confronted with the board‟s motion, the trial justice was 5', 'The union also directs our attention to two decisions of this Court—Providence Teachers Union, Local 958, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO v.

School Committee of Providence, 108 R.I. 444, 276 A.2d 762 (1971)—in which the board and the union arbitrated issues concerning retiree benefits.

19,State : v. : Jeffrey Martin.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Jeffrey Martin, appeals from a judgment of conviction for first-degree sexual assault following a jury trial in the Superior Court. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his request to instruct the jury on the defense of consent, in admitting certain testimony under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule, and in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because of irregularities in the grand jury proceedings. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The July 8, 2006 sequence of events underlying this appeal began at a Hooters restaurant in the City of Warwick where defendant went to watch a pay-per-view Ultimate Fighting Championship match. While there, defendant met Samantha, 1 who was also watching the fight. The two engaged in conversation throughout the evening, and exchanged contact information. The next day, defendant contacted Samantha, and they made plans to meet later that day at Iggy’s restaurant in Warwick. They drove separately to Iggy’s and ate lunch together. After 1', 'We shall use a pseudonym to refer to the complaining witness throughout this opinion.', '-1- lunch, they had drinks at the nearby Sandbar, and then decided to go to Kartabar in Providence. The two drove to Providence together in Samantha’s car. Samantha testified that on their way to Kartabar, they stopped at an ATM as well as at defendant’s apartment, where defendant spent a short time showing her around. The defendant testified differently: he said that although they stopped at an ATM on their way to Kartabar, it was not until after they left Kartabar that they visited his apartment. Both defendant and Samantha testified that they spent time together at Kartabar that afternoon.', 'From there, the testimony of Samantha and defendant diverges substantially. Samantha testified that, as she was driving defendant back to where his vehicle was parked in Warwick, he repeatedly asked if he could see her apartment but that she declined each of those requests. According to Samantha, defendant persisted, asserting that he needed to use the bathroom. Samantha testified that, because she did not know of a public restroom in the immediate vicinity, she relented and let him use the bathroom in her apartment, which was nearby. After defendant used her bathroom, Samantha showed him her apartment, including her pet ferrets, which she kept in a cage in her bedroom. Samantha testified that, after she put the ferrets away, she and defendant started to kiss, and defendant pushed her onto the bed, where they continued kissing. She also testified that, at some point, “defendant tried to move his hand underneath [her] shirt up towards [her] bra” and then “tried to move underneath the bra” on her right side; she added that she “said no, and [she] was able to free [her] right hand and grab his and pull it down.” Samantha asserted that defendant then tried to remove her shorts, to which she responded, “No, Jeff, stop.” She testified that by this point she had stopped kissing defendant, but that he was still trying to kiss her, and that he began to remove his own pants. Although she continued to tell defendant “no” and tried to push him away, defendant took her hand and placed it on his erect', '-2- penis. Samantha testified that, after she forcefully removed her hand from defendant’s penis, he “inserted his fingers into [her] vagina,” where they remained “for a few seconds.” She recounted that she “yelled no and was able to move [her] hand down and grab his hand to remove [his fingers]” and that, when she tried to push him away, “[h]e grabbed [her] around the neck” and choked her. Samantha testified that this struggle continued and that defendant eventually “tr[ied] to insert his penis into [her].” According to Samantha, defendant continued in these attempts for a few minutes despite her continued protests, but was unsuccessful because she was still wearing shorts and the bottom half of a two-piece swimsuit.', 'Samantha testified that, after various attempts, she was finally able to push defendant away and get up from the bed, at which point she yelled at defendant to get dressed. The defendant eventually got dressed and Samantha drove him back to where his car was parked. She explained that she behaved calmly because “[she] didn’t want to set the defendant off. [She] wanted to keep the cool demeanor that he seemed to have at the time and just get him back to his car and get away from him at that point.” She testified that, when defendant asked if they could see each other again, she responded “maybe” (again, because she did not want to anger him) and that defendant kissed her before exiting her car, but that she did not reciprocate. Samantha recalled that she took a circuitous route back to her apartment and attempted to call four friends while en route, including Dawn Benson, who called her back approximately thirty minutes later.', 'The defendant recalled the events of July 9, 2006, very differently. The defendant testified that when they drove past Samantha’s apartment, he asked if they could “check it out” and Samantha agreed to show him. She gave him a tour and showed him her pet ferrets in her bedroom. The defendant testified that, while they were in her bedroom, he noticed a laundry basket full of lingerie and that, when he asked her if she would ever wear it for him, she', '-3- responded, “maybe I will.” He testified that they sat down on the bed together, where they started kissing and “caressing each other.” The defendant recounted that he rubbed Samantha’s breasts both on top of and beneath her shirt, and that she was making “sounds of pleasure.” He also testified that he “lifted up her shirt and * * * was kissing her breasts,” and that they started “massaging” each other in the “crotch area.” However, defendant recounted that, when he started to unbutton his pants, Samantha told him, “No sex on the first date,” to which he responded, “I know,” and “went back to kissing her breasts.” The defendant testified that he did not at any time pin or throw Samantha to the bed, and that he neither penetrated her with his finger nor attempted to have sex with her. Additionally, the defendant testified that he was not aroused at any point during the interaction, that he never had his pants or underwear off, and that the only time Samantha said “no” was with reference to not having sex on a first date. The defendant asserted that, eventually, the two were interrupted by sounds coming from the ferret cage and that, after Samantha got up to tend to the ferrets, defendant used the bathroom and then they left the apartment. The defendant recounted that he flirted with and touched Samantha as she was driving him back to his car and that he “was planning on kissing her, but she * * * beat [him] to the punch,” by initiating a goodbye kiss.', 'Samantha also testified that two days later, she received two text messages from defendant, which read “Morning” and “How is your day going?” Additionally, she testified that she received two voicemail messages from defendant, but that they had been erased approximately one year after the incident. Samantha indicated that she told law-enforcement officials about the text and voicemail messages, but was not asked to save or copy them.', 'On July 13, 2006, Samantha contacted the police to make a complaint. She explained that she delayed in reporting the incident because “[she] felt very lucky to have gotten away from', '-4- the defendant and [she] thought that [she] could easily forget the situation as soon as [she] got away from him,” but that “[e]very day got worse to the point where [she] wasn’t eating, wasn’t drinking, and had trouble sleeping.” Both Samantha and defendant gave statements to the police.', 'In May 2007, the Kent County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging defendant with one count of first-degree sexual assault (digital-vaginal penetration) and one count of assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault (penile-vaginal penetration).', 'The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment because of irregularities at the grand jury proceeding and because the prosecutor failed to present the grand jury with exculpatory evidence. In a written order issued in February 2007, a Superior Court justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss, noting that there is no requirement that a prosecutor present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury and concluding that the state did not commit such flagrant prosecutorial misconduct as to warrant dismissing the indictment.', 'In June 2009, the case proceeded to trial. The jury heard the testimony of Samantha and defendant, described supra. Additionally, Ms. Benson testified about the telephone conversation she had with Samantha shortly after the events had transpired. Specifically, Ms. Benson testified that Samantha was “upset” during the call, that her tone of voice sounded different from how it normally sounded, that Ms. Benson “just could tell” that Samantha “wasn’t herself,” and that Samantha “just kept saying the same thing over and over again.” Ms. Benson recalled that Samantha told her that, after she had lunch with defendant, they went to Samantha’s apartment where defendant “threw her down on the bed” even though “she said no repeatedly to his advances.” Additionally, Ms. Benson testified that Samantha conveyed that, after defendant “threw her on the bed, he penetrated her with his finger.” The defendant objected to the introduction of Ms. Benson’s testimony, arguing that it was hearsay to which the excited-', '-5- utterance exception did not apply, it was unduly prejudicial, and it served only to impermissibly corroborate Samantha’s own testimony. 2', 'The trial justice overruled defendant’s objection, noting that the conversation between Samantha and Ms. Benson took place shortly after the traumatic event and that “it [wa]s quite clear that [Samantha] was still operating under an emotional state,” as indicated by the substantial trauma that she testified she had experienced, her various attempts to call friends for advice and support, and Ms. Benson’s observation that Samantha sounded upset.', 'At the conclusion of evidence, defendant requested that the trial justice instruct the jury on the defense of consent and on mistake of fact as to consent. Specifically, defendant argued that the jury could conclude, based on the evidence presented, that the alleged penetration occurred, but that Samantha had consented to it, or that defendant had made a reasonable mistake of fact as to her consent. However, the trial justice concluded that consent was not at issue in this case because, based on the testimony given, the assault either took place or it did not and that, therefore, a consent instruction would only invite the jury to speculate as to other scenarios that may have occurred. Therefore, the court rejected defendant’s proposed consent instruction.', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on count 1 (digital-vaginal penetration) and a not-guilty verdict on count 2 (assault with intent to commit penile-vaginal penetration). The defendant moved for a new trial, which the trial justice denied, concluding that Samantha was credible, defendant was not credible, and a consent instruction was not warranted because no evidence was presented at trial to support a consent theory. A judgment of conviction entered on August 21, 2009, and defendant timely appealed. 2', 'Although defendant argued in his written submissions to this Court that Ms. Benson’s testimony amounted to impermissible “bolstering,” he acknowledged at oral arguments before this Court that “corroborating” might be a more appropriate term.', '-6-', 'II', 'Discussion', 'The defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in refusing to instruct the jury on a consent defense. Secondly, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in admitting Ms. Benson’s hearsay testimony. Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. We address each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Jury Instructions', 'The trial justice instructed the jury that, to find defendant guilty on count 1, it needed to find that digital-vaginal penetration occurred, that such penetration was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, and that defendant accomplished the penetration “by means of force or coercion.” The trial justice explained that', '“Force or coercion means overcoming the complainant through the', 'application of physical force or violence against her will. The', 'element of force or coercion requires that the State prove that the', 'defendant used force or violence before the penetration occurred.', 'The degree of force must be more than the force necessary to', 'accomplish the act of penetration.” Additionally, the jury was instructed that, as to Samantha’s resistance, the state was required to prove that “[she] offered such resistance, if any, as seems reasonable under the circumstances.” The defendant requested that the trial justice also instruct the jury that as to count 1,', '“In order to find the defendant guilty, the State must prove beyond', 'a reasonable doubt that [Samantha] * * * did not consent to the', 'first degree sexual assault of digital/vaginal penetration. The', 'defendant does not have the burden of proving the defense of', 'consent. It is the State’s burden to negate it beyond a reasonable', 'doubt. A woman must offer such resistance as seems reasonable', 'under all the circumstances.”', '-7- The trial justice denied defendant’s request, and on appeal defendant argues that this amounts to reversible error “because the evidence as a whole had created a factual basis from which the jury could have properly found consent and acquitted [defendant].” The state responds that, because there was no testimony to support a consent theory in this case, the jury could have reached defendant’s conclusion only through negative inferences, which are, by themselves, insufficient to support a jury charge.', '“We undergo a review of jury instructions on a de novo basis.” State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 22 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 423 (R.I. 2011)). It is well settled that this Court “review[s] ‘[jury] instructions in their entirety,’” and “we will affirm if ‘the instructions adequately cover the law and neither reduce nor shift the state’s burden of proof.’” Id. (quoting Cipriano, 21 A.3d at 423). Moreover, we review jury instructions “to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them, * * * and we review challenged portions of jury instructions in the context in which they were rendered.” State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 475 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 929 (R.I. 2005)). “As long as the trial justice’s general charge has fairly covered a requested charge for jury instructions, his refusal to grant the requested charge is not reversible error.” State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1128-29 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Turner, 746 A.2d 700, 703 (R.I. 2000)).', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-2(2) provides that “[a] person is guilty of first degree sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with another person, and if * * * [t]he accused uses force or coercion.” Section 11-37-1(2)(ii) provides that “[f]orce or coercion” occurs “when the accused * * * [o]vercomes the victim through the application of physical force or physical violence.” We have held that “[i]t is the state’s burden to prove lack of consent beyond a', '-8- reasonable doubt.” State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 60 (R.I. 2011). However, we have also indicated that lack of consent is not an element of the offense, but rather consent is a defense to the crime, id.; and thus, we have held that, when a jury charge adequately covers the “force or coercion” element, a separate instruction on consent is unnecessary. See Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 477. For example, in Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 471, 472, the complaining witness testified that the defendant pinned her down on a couch and digitally penetrated her vagina. The defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault, and the trial justice instructed the jury on the “force or coercion” element as follows:', '“Force or coercion in this context means that the accused * * *', 'overcomes * * * [the complaining witness] * * * through the', 'application of physical force or violence. The law does not expect', 'the complaining witness * * * as part of the State’s proof of the use', 'of physical force or coercion to engage in heroic resistance when', 'such behavior could be fruitless or foolhardy.” Id. at 477. The defendant in that case requested that the jury also be instructed that, “[a]t a minimum, the alleged victim must demonstrate her lack of consent before the act occurs and then must offer such resistance as is reasonable under all the circumstances,” but the trial justice refused to give that charge. Id. at 476, 477. We affirmed the trial justice’s decision to not instruct on lack of consent and concluded that the instruction given was “adequate” because “[a]lthough the term ‘lack of consent’ [wa]s not explicitly utilized, the * * * quoted portion of the instructions d[id] employ the verb ‘overcomes’—which, when one reads the instructions in their entirety, can only mean that, as a precondition to a guilty verdict, the fact-finder must find a lack of consent.” Id. at 477. We perceive Adefusika to be on all fours with the case at bar. In particular, we note that, as in Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 477, the jury instructions here provided that “[f]orce or coercion means overcoming the complainant through the application of physical force or violence against her will.” (Emphasis added.) We are of the opinion that this instruction adequately conveyed to', '-9- the jury that, to find defendant guilty of first-degree sexual assault, it also needed to conclude that Samantha did not consent to the penetration.', 'Moreover, we reject defendant’s contention that the evidence presented at trial supported his consent theory. In particular, we observe that neither Samantha’s testimony nor defendant’s testimony supports a version of events in which the alleged penetration took place, but with Samantha’s consent: on one hand, Samantha testified to digital penetration against her will, after a struggle and numerous protests; on the other hand, defendant testified that the alleged penetration simply did not occur. In the context of self-defense, we have held that a trial justice is obligated to give a proposed instruction on self-defense “regardless of how ‘slight and tenuous the evidence may be on which the self-defense hypothesis is advanced.’” Linde, 876 A.2d at 1130 (quoting State v. Butler, 107 R.I. 489, 496, 268 A.2d 433, 436 (1970)). However, for a defense instruction to be warranted, “the record as a whole must contain at least a scintilla of evidence supporting the defendant’s theory,” and we have affirmed a trial justice’s refusal to give a proposed instruction where there was an “incongruent self-defense theory proffered by [the defendant] to the trial justice and [a] dearth of evidence applicable to a properly articulated theory.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 634 (R.I. 2011). In fact, we have cautioned that an instruction that is unsupported by the evidence adduced at trial runs the risk of confusing or misleading the jury and thus should not be given. State v. DiChristofaro, 848 A.2d 1127, 1130 (R.I. 2004). Applying these concepts to the case at bar, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on a consent defense that was unsupported by any of the testimony given at trial. We hold, therefore, that given the evidence presented here, the jury instructions given in this case adequately apprised the jury of the operative legal concepts that were in play.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'Ms. Benson’s Testimony', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred in admitting Ms. Benson’s testimony regarding the telephone conversation she had with Samantha shortly after the events in question. In particular, defendant maintains that Ms. Benson’s testimony was inadmissible hearsay that did not fall within the exited-utterance exception of Rule 803(2) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because Ms. Benson could not adequately perceive Samantha’s demeanor over the telephone and, further, because prior to the conversation Samantha had the time and opportunity “to collect [her] thoughts.” Additionally, defendant maintains that introduction of Ms. Benson’s testimony was not harmless error, but rather improperly corroborated or bolstered Samantha’s testimony because “[t]he jury was permitted to hear [Samantha’s] story twice while only hearing Mr. Martin’s once and, as such, there was a very real possibility that Ms. Benson’s testimony improperly influenced the jury’s verdict.” The state responds that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in concluding that Samantha’s conversation with Ms. Benson fell within the excited-utterance exception because the conversation took place less than an hour after the alleged assault, Samantha’s own conduct indicated that she was still operating under the stress of the event, and Ms. Benson testified that Samantha seemed upset during their conversation. Additionally, the state contends that Ms. Benson’s testimony does not amount to impermissible bolstering because she merely recounted what Samantha had told her, without commenting on Samantha’s credibility or veracity.', 'Hearsay is defined in Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Pursuant to Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of', '- 11 - Evidence, hearsay statements are inadmissible except as provided by law. “[A] determination of whether an out-of-court statement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion.” Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 996 A.2d 684, 692 (R.I. 2010). “Under this standard, a trial justice’s ruling will be upheld unless abuse of discretion that prejudices the complaining party is shown.” State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1247 (R.I. 2010).', 'One exception to the hearsay exclusion is for excited utterances, which Rule 803(2) defines as “[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.” “The rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that ‘a startling event may produce an effect that temporarily stills the declarant’s capacity of reflection and produces statements free of conscious fabrication.’” State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 314 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1222 (R.I. 2002)). Thus, “[t]he test is whether, from a consideration of all the facts, the declarant ‘was still laboring under the stress of excitement caused by the event when he or she made the statement at issue.’” Id. at 315 (quoting State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 120 (R.I. 2006)). However, the “statement need not have been ‘strictly contemporaneous with the startling event’” to qualify as an excited utterance, id. (quoting State v. Momplaisir, 815 A.2d 65, 70 (R.I. 2003)), and we have repeatedly held that “[t]he time requirement is more lenient in sexual assault cases under the reasoning that ‘the shock of the event often lasts longer and the outpouring may come only later, when a parent, friend, or officer is present.’” Id. (quoting Morales, 895 A.2d at 120).', 'Here, the trial justice concluded that, although hearsay, Ms. Benson’s testimony regarding what Samantha told her was nonetheless admissible as an excited utterance because it had all the hallmarks of having been made under the stress of a traumatic event. In particular,', '- 12 - the trial justice explained that Ms. Benson and Samantha had been close friends for several years, the two maintained frequent telephone contact, and Ms. Benson described Samantha’s tone of voice as sounding “upset” and as though “she wasn’t herself.” He also noted that, by her own testimony, Samantha was quite traumatized by the events of the day, as evidenced by the facts that she attempted to quickly remove defendant from her home, took a circuitous route back to her apartment so that defendant would not follow her, and tried to contact four friends for advice and support, all of which indicated that Samantha was still operating under the stress of the event at the time she spoke with Ms. Benson. Additionally, he found that the trial testimony indicated that the conversation between Samantha and Ms. Benson took place within an hour of the traumatic events. Finally, the trial justice noted that Samantha waited several days before filing a police report because she thought she would be able to forget about the events of that day, but was ultimately unsuccessful in doing so, suggesting “that there was a lingering emotion[al] trauma associated with the sexual assault.” Thus, the trial justice concluded that, based on the totality of the circumstances, Samantha’s statement to Ms. Benson was made while she was still laboring under the stress of the traumatic event and before she had the opportunity to invent or misrepresent facts.', 'We observe that, in addition to the factors noted by the trial justice, Ms. Benson testified that, during the telephone conversation, Samantha “just kept saying the same thing over and over again,” further suggesting that Samantha was in an excited state at that point.', 'Moreover, Samantha’s testimony indicated that Ms. Benson was the first person she talked to following the event. Cf. State v. Burgess, 465 A.2d 204, 207 (R.I. 1983) (holding that the complainant’s statement to a physician regarding a sexual assault was not an excited utterance when it was made nearly three hours after the assault, the complainant had already talked with three other', '- 13 - people about the assault, and the physician merely described the complainant as “emotionally upset” at the time she made the statement). We are satisfied that, based on these factors, the trial justice could have reasonably concluded that Samantha was still operating under the stress of the event and that, therefore, he did not abuse his discretion in admitting Ms. Benson’s testimony under the excited- utterance exception to the hearsay rule.', 'Finally, we reject defendant’s argument that Ms. Benson’s testimony amounted to impermissible bolstering or improper corroborating. “Impermissible ‘bolstering’ or ‘vouching’ typically occurs when one witness ‘offer[s] an opinion regarding the truthfulness or accuracy of another witness’[s] testimony.’” State v. Arroyo, 844 A.2d 163, 169 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Lassiter, 836 A.2d 1096, 1107 (R.I. 2003)). However, it may also “occur even if the witness does not literally state an opinion concerning the credibility of another witness’s testimony,” but rather, where “one witness’s testimony has the same substantive import as if it addressed another witness’s credibility, it is inadmissible.” Id. (quoting Lassiter, 836 A.2d at 1107). For example, in State v.

We also pointed out that the victim in that case testified at trial, giving the jury “the opportunity to hear the same story directly from [her].” Id. By contrast, in State v.

Second, defendant argues that he was unduly prejudiced when Det. Petit testified incorrectly that a picture of defendant, which was used in a photo array presented to Samantha, had been obtained from the Warwick Police Department’s arrested-persons records, when, in reality, the photo was obtained from the Division of Motor Vehicles. The defendant argues that this error unduly prejudiced him before the grand jury, as evidenced by the fact that it prompted one of the grand jurors to ask about whether defendant had any prior sexual-assault arrests.', 'The state responds that none of the prosecutorial misconduct alleged here was so flagrant as to warrant dismissal of the indictment, and it argues that the prosecutor was under no duty to present exculpatory evidence at the grand jury proceeding. Additionally, the state urges that, even if prosecutorial misconduct rendered the initial indictment defective, those defects are harmless error and were cured because defendant has since been tried before, and convicted by, a petit jury.', 'This Court has recognized that some fundamental flaws in the grand jury process, such as race and gender discrimination in the grand jury selection process, “require automatic dismissal of an indictment.” State v.

Petit knew about those messages when he testified before the grand jury. However, defendant does not clearly indicate how or why testimony about those messages before the grand jury was prejudicial. Additionally, at trial, defendant had the opportunity to, and did in fact, cross- examine Samantha about the text messages and voicemail messages, and he does not now complain about the introduction of this evidence at trial. Therefore, we understand defendant’s primary claim of error to be about the controlled phone calls, rather than the unrecorded text and voicemail messages.', '- 16 - “held that a trial on the merits renders harmless any defect that occurred in the grand jury process,” id. at 428 (quoting State v. Mainelli, 543 A.2d 1311, 1313 (R.I. 1988)), because “[t]he petit jury’s subsequent guilty verdict means not only that there was probable cause to believe that the defendants were guilty as charged, but also that they are in fact guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 428 (quoting State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1191 (R.I. 1988)).

Thus, it is clear that, even without the irregularities present at the grand jury proceeding, “[t]he petit jury’s subsequent guilty verdict means not only that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant[] w[as] guilty as charged, but also that [he was] in fact guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.” Russell, 950 A.2d at 428 (quoting Woodson, 551 A.2d at 1191).

(Cinemaworld). Relevant to this appeal, a trial justice of the Superior Court—ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment—declared as a matter of law that the formula allocating Cinemaworld’s reasonable share of real estate taxes should be based on the square footage of its leased premises. Relying on that conclusion, the trial justice granted partial summary judgment in Cinemaworld’s favor with respect to its motion seeking an accounting, and he denied Inland’s request for costs. Inland appeals from that decision, arguing that the trial justice erred when he adopted a formula that was not supported by the language of the lease. Inland also argues that the trial justice erred in declining to award interest, late charges, expenses, and attorneys’ fees, all of which, Inland argues, are mandated by the lease. This case came before this Court on May 7, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this', '-1- appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument.

These included “Minimum Rent,” which was specifically defined in the lease, and “Additional Rent,” which was described in the lease as “[a]ll other sums as shall become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease.” Article 1, section 1.01(i); Article 3, sections 3.01(a), (b).', 'Under the umbrella of “Additional Rent”—and the matter which gives rise to the underlying dispute—was the requirement that Cinemaworld pay an amount equal to the real estate taxes “levied, assessed, or otherwise imposed” against the movie theater.

On December 10, 2004, Cinema World, Inc. assigned all of its right, title, and interest as a tenant under the lease to Cinemaworld. In May 2006, MB Lincoln Mall, LLC (MB Lincoln Mall) purchased the Lincoln Mall from LB Lincoln Mall, and Inland became its managing agent.', 'Prior to the closing between MB Lincoln Mall and LB Lincoln Mall, LB Lincoln Mall and Cinemaworld executed a release agreement and estoppel certificate, which are not at issue in this case.', '-2- of the lease concerning the apportionment of real estate taxes included Article 9, entitled “Taxes,” and Article 25, entitled “Tenant’s Property.”', 'Under section 9.01(a), “Taxes” were defined as “all taxes * * * commonly and generally referred to as ‘real estate taxes’ * * * levied, assessed, or otherwise imposed upon, the Land or any part thereof, the Building(s) and Improvements * * *.”2 The lease also provided that Cinemaworld was required to exercise “its best efforts to take the steps necessary to have the Premises [it leased] assessed as a separate tax parcel”—something that Cinemaworld did not do. Section 9.01(b). According to Inland, some tenants at the Lincoln Mall had their premises assessed and levied as a separate tax parcel and, pursuant to the lease, paid real estate taxes directly to the Town of Lincoln. The remainder of the Lincoln Mall, including the premises leased to Cinemaworld, was taxed to Inland as a single parcel, and, therefore, pursuant to the lease, Cinemaworld was required to make monthly payments to Inland of a “reasonably estimate[d]” real estate tax, which was equal to one-twelfth of Lincoln Mall’s real estate taxes for their leased premises for the current calendar or fiscal year. Section 9.02(b). The lease further provided that at the end of each year—after Inland had received all of the tax and assessment bills that were attributable to the Lincoln Mall—“Landlord shall furnish Tenant a written statement of the actual amount of the Taxes for such year,” and the tenant would either pay or be credited for the difference between the amount of actual taxes due for the year and the “reasonably estimate[d]” amount that was paid.

The formula Inland employed to allocate the tax bill to the individual tenants, including Cinemaworld, was “on a pro rata basis by dividing each tenant’s gross leasable square footage (60,000 for Cinemaworld) by the total gross leasable square footage for the Shopping Center.”', 'Cinemaworld notified Inland that it disagreed with Inland’s allocation of the real estate taxes and requested a breakdown of the figures used in the calculation. However, according to Cinemaworld, Inland simply responded with a list of the square footage of all of the Lincoln Mall tenants and a copy of the bill that it had previously sent to Cinemaworld.', 'Despite Cinemaworld’s objection to Inland’s demand for the payment of unpaid taxes, on July 15, 2008, Cinemaworld paid $67,000 toward the real estate taxes that Inland claimed were due and owing.', 'On August 1, 2008, notwithstanding Cinemaworld’s payment, Inland filed a complaint for breach of the lease for Cinemaworld’s alleged failure to make timely payments as required by the lease. Cinemaworld filed responsive pleadings and, following an avalanche of amended', '-4- pleadings and other motions, both sides filed cross-motions for summary judgment in November 2009. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Inland maintained that the language of the lease was unambiguous and that it clearly required that real estate taxes be allocated by the square footage of Cinemaworld’s leased premises, including the taxes attributable to parking and common areas. Conversely, Cinemaworld argued that the proper assessment of real estate taxes should not include the taxes attributable to parking and common areas. On June 1, 2010, Inland filed a supplemental memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, in which Inland asserted—for the first time—that the allocation of real estate taxes should be based on the fair market value of the leased premises.', 'On January 7, 2011, the trial justice rendered a written decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial justice found that “neither party appear[ed] to dispute the basic formula by which to calculate Cinemaworld’s ‘reasonable share’ of the Taxes,” and, based on this, he concluded “that Cinemaworld’s reasonable share should be computed by multiplying the tax bill by a fraction, the numerator of which is the square footage of the theater and denominator of which is the square footage of the Shopping Center.” 3 He also found that each party should bear its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses.', 'On October 4, 2011, Inland filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial justice denied.

Cinemaworld, however, argues that the trial justice appropriately construed the terms of the lease in allocating the real estate taxes based on the square footage of the leased premises.', 'In reviewing the lease, we apply the laws of contract interpretation. See Elena Carcieri Trust-1988 v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Rhode Island, 871 A.2d 944, 947 (R.I. 2005) (applying contract-interpretation principles to a lease agreement). As is the case in contract interpretation, whether a lease is ambiguous or not is a question of law that this Court reviews on a de novo basis. Furtado v. Goncalves, 63 A.3d 533, 537 (R.I. 2013). In determining whether a lease is ambiguous, “we give words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning. * * * The subjective intent of the parties may not properly be considered by the Court; rather, we consider the intent expressed by the language of the [lease].” Id. (quoting Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 128 (R.I. 2012)). Thus, if a lease “is clear and unambiguous by its terms, ‘what is claimed to have been the subjective intent of the parties is of no moment.’” Id. (quoting Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 560 (R.I. 2009)). “In situations in which the language of a [lease] is plain and unambiguous, its meaning should be determined without reference to extrinsic facts or aids.” Id. (quoting Garden City Treatment Center, Inc. v. Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004)).', 'After reviewing the record and the lease document itself, we are of the firm opinion that the provisions of the lease at issue are ambiguous. At the outset, we note that section 9.01 of the lease provides that the term “real estate taxes” is to mean its “commonly and generally” accepted sense; however, the lease provides no further assistance as to the meaning of this term or in determining how to allocate Cinemaworld’s share thereof. Because the term “real estate taxes” is not defined in the lease, we often refer to sources such as dictionaries to give a term its plain,', '-7- ordinary, and usual meaning. See Garden City Treatment Center, Inc., 852 A.2d at 542-43 (in determining the plain meaning of a word, this Court will often apply a common meaning as provided by a recognized dictionary). Nevertheless, a reference to the dictionary provides no assistance in attempting to clarify the meaning of “real estate taxes.” Indeed, Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term “tax” as “[a] charge, usu[ually] monetary, imposed by the government on persons, entities, transactions, or property to yield public revenue,” and the term “property tax” as “[a] tax levied on the owner of property (esp. real property), usu[ually] based on the property’s value.” Id. 1594, 1596 (9th ed. 2009). These definitions, however, offer no guidance as to how the real estate taxes are to be calculated under the terms of the particular lease at issue here.', 'In addition, when viewing the lease in its entirety, the sections of the lease relating to the allocation of “real estate taxes” appear to be internally inconsistent. See W.P. Associates v. Forcier, Inc., 637 A.2d 353, 356 (R.I. 1994) (“In determining whether an agreement is clear and unambiguous, the document must be viewed in its entirety and its language be given its plain, ordinary and usual meaning.”). Article 9 of the lease imposes an obligation on Cinemaworld to pay “the actual amount of the [real estate t]axes for such year,” although the lease provides no explicit formula or guidance as to how to calculate the “actual amount” of real estate taxes. Section 9.02(b) (emphasis added). Similarly, Article 25 of the lease provides that Cinemaworld is required to pay a “reasonable share” of “any and all taxes,” including the real estate taxes assessed against Inland, yet Article 25 fails to define how the “reasonable share” of real estate taxes should be calculated. 4 Section 25.01 (emphasis added). Thus, in addition to not clearly 4', 'The full text of Article 25, section 25.01 provides:', '“Tenant shall be responsible for, and shall pay, prior to', 'delinquency, any and all taxes, assessments, levies, fees and other', '-8- delineating how real estate taxes are to be calculated, Articles 9 and 25 of the lease appear to be in conflict as each give rise to different methods of calculating real estate taxes: Article 9, section 9.02(b) imposes an obligation on Cinemaworld to pay “the actual amount” of real estate taxes, while Article 25, section 25.01 imposes an obligation on Cinemaworld to pay a “reasonable share” thereof. See Rotelli v. Catanzaro, 686 A.2d 91, 95 (R.I. 1996) (contract language is usually ambiguous where the terms are inconsistent on their face). 5 Accordingly, given the different possible ways of calculating real estate taxes, and after reviewing the lease in its', 'governmental charges of every kind or nature (collectively,', '‘Charges’) levied or assessed by an[y] municipal, county, state,', 'federal or other taxing or assessing authority upon, against or with', 'respect to:', '“(i)', 'The Premises or any leasehold interest therein, or', 'any use thereof, including, without limitation, any use and/or', 'occupancy tax,', '“(ii) All fixtures, furnishings, equipment, merchandise', 'and personal property of any kind owned by Tenant and placed,', 'installed or located in, within, upon or about the Premises, and', '“(iii) All or any portion of the Rentals payable by Tenant', 'to Landlord; irrespective of whether any of such items described in', 'clauses (i) through (i) [sic] above are assessed as real or personal', 'property, and irrespective of whether any of such items are', 'assessed to or against Landlord or Tenant.', '“If at any time during the Term any of such Charges are not', 'levied and assessed separately and directly to Tenant (for example,', 'if the same are levied or assessed to Landlord, or upon or against', 'the Shopping Center and/or the land underlying the Shopping', 'Center), Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant’s reasonable share', 'thereof as reasonably determined by Landlord in consultation with', 'Tenant.” (Emphases added.) While section 25.01 uses the term “real * * * property,” that term is synonymous with real estate. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1337 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “real property” as “[a]lso termed * * * real estate”). 5', 'Although the heading of section 25.01, “Taxes on Tenant’s Property,” seems to indicate that that particular section is limited to personal property and excise taxes assessed and levied against the tenant, we note that headings serve only as an aid in a court’s interpretation. See Town of East Greenwich v. O’Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 109 (R.I. 1992) (applying that canon of construction to a statute). Indeed, the text of section 25.01 is broader than the heading and applies to any taxes assessed either to or against “real or personal property” and “to or against Landlord or Tenant.”', '-9- entirety and according the language its plain, ordinary, and usual meaning, section 9.01— requiring Cinemaworld to pay “all taxes * * * commonly and generally referred to as ‘real estate taxes’”—is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and, therefore, is ambiguous. Rotelli, 686 A.2d at 94 (A contract is ambiguous “when it is reasonably and clearly susceptible to more than one interpretation.”).', 'In an effort to blunt the force of the foregoing conclusion, Inland argues that the real estate taxes should be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of Cinemaworld’s leased premises by the applicable tax rate. First, Inland maintains that pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 44-5- 12(a)—which provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ll real property subject to taxation shall be assessed at its full and fair cash value * * * to be determined by the assessors in each town or city”—the provisions of the lease that address the allocation of real estate taxes cannot mean anything other than that Cinemaworld must pay the taxes apportioned to its specific, assessed value. We disagree.', 'Inland’s position rests on the assumption that the term “real estate taxes” as used in the lease has the same meaning as applied under § 44-5-12. However, this statutory definition does not automatically render that term to be unambiguous. Although the parties used a phrase that has a statutory definition in Rhode Island, there is nothing in the lease to suggest that the parties intended to adopt this discrete, statutory definition of “real estate taxes.” See Garden City Treatment Center, Inc., 852 A.2d at 543 (“Contracting parties are free to define a term as they see fit, but they must do so in writing if they intend the term to carry a technical definition.”). Indeed, “[w]e decline to read nonexistent terms or limitations into a contract.” Pearson v. Pearson, 11 A.3d 103, 109 (R.I. 2011).', '- 10 -', 'Because the term “real estate taxes” as used in the lease is neither defined within the document, nor specifically governed by the statute, we are satisfied that the term is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.', 'Thus, although contract interpretation is a question of law, when the contract terms are ambiguous, interpretation of the terms becomes a question of fact. Accordingly, at this stage of the proceedings—interpreting ambiguous contractual language—statutes and common-law principles should be considered as only part of the surrounding circumstances from which to discern the intent of the parties. See Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 58 (R.I. 1980) (While it is well settled that existing law is an implied term of every contract, “existing law is an extrinsic aid to discerning the contracting parties’ intent” in construing an ambiguous contract.); see also 11 Samuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts § 30:21 at 286 (4th ed. Lord 2012) (“[T]he rule that existing law is incorporated into every contract * * * does not go so far as to mean that statutory definitions in a particular code govern the interpretation of every ambiguous phrase in a private agreement.”). A resort to such outside sources is not permitted to aid or explain the intended meaning of the parties, unless and until the contract language is found to be ambiguous. See Furtado, 63 A.3d at 537; Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Dufault, 958 A.2d 620, 624-25 (R.I. 2008) (“[B]efore the trial justice may look to extrinsic evidence an ambiguity must be found in the terms of the contract.”). However, in this case, because we conclude that the language of the lease is ambiguous, we agree with Inland that § 44-5-12 is certainly one of several pieces of extrinsic evidence that should be considered to resolve the ambiguity. Nonetheless, it is not appropriate to consider this evidence on a motion for summary judgment because the intent of the parties is a question of fact. Lennon v. MacGregor, 423 A.2d 820, 822 (R.I. 1980).', '- 11 -', 'Additionally, Inland argues that the allocation of real estate taxes in this case should be determined by references to the valuation of Cinemaworld in “Property Record Card Summar[ies]” that were provided by the municipality. However, in our view, Inland’s reliance on the “Property Record Card Summar[ies]” is misplaced. Those summaries were used by the tax assessor in determining the amount of real estate taxes to be levied against the Lincoln Mall. Consequently, they merely provide an explanation as to how the assessment of real estate taxes for the Lincoln Mall was derived. Indeed, Cinamaworld did not exist as a separate taxable parcel during the years in question, and, therefore, contrary to Inland’s assertion, the Town of Lincoln did not “independently assess[] the value of Cinemaworld’s Premises.” Further, the lease itself does not provide that the parties intended the summaries to be a reliable proxy for the fair market value that should be affixed to Cinemaworld.', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the summaries afford Inland no support for its contention that the lease unambiguously directs that real estate taxes should be allocated by the fair market value of Cinemaworld’s premises. However, concluding as we do that the lease is ambiguous in this regard, the summaries may well assist as an interpretive aid to determine the parties’ intent, but, again, such a determination cannot properly be resolved at the summary judgment stage. See D.T.P., Inc. v. Red Bridge Properties, Inc., 576 A.2d 1377, 1382 (R.I. 1990) (“If the terms of a contract are ambiguous, the court will look to the construction placed upon such terms by the parties themselves as an aid in determining their intended meaning. * * * The circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract are also relevant to the determination of that intent.” quoting Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951 v. School Committee of Woonsocket, 117 R.I. 373, 376, 367 A.2d 203, 205 (1976)); see Restatement (Second) Contracts', '- 12 - § 203(b) (1981) (course of performance, course of dealing, and usage in custom or industry may be used in determining the intent of contracting parties).', 'Finally, Inland maintains that Cinemaworld’s interpretation of the lease is unreasonable. Specifically, Inland argues that Cinemaworld would obtain an unfair benefit under a formula that allocates the real estate taxes by square footage, because the Town of Lincoln attributes different values to the various buildings at the Lincoln Mall, and Cinemaworld’s leased premises, which is a newer building, has a higher fair market value than most of the other tenants in the Lincoln Mall. Although we agree with Inland that interpreting the ambiguous language of the lease should be guided by well-established principles of contract interpretation, including the principle that contracts are to be construed according to the fair and reasonable meaning of their words, see Durapin, Inc. v. American Products, Inc., 559 A.2d 1051, 1056 (R.I. 1989), summary judgment is inappropriate where references to extrinsic evidence and the surrounding circumstances must be relied on to discern the intent of the contracting parties.', 'For its part, Cinemaworld maintains that real estate taxes should be calculated based on the square footage of the leased premises, less the taxes attributable to parking and common area. As Inland correctly highlights, Cinemaworld’s suggested formula is almost identical to the formula provided under Article 8 of the lease to determine the “Tenant’s Proportionate Share” of “Common Area Maintenance Costs.”', 'Section 8.04.', 'In particular, the lease provides that “Tenant’s Proportionate Share”', '“shall mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the leasable floor', 'area of the Building and the denominator of which is the leasable', 'floor area of all buildings on the Shopping Center as of the first', 'day of the applicable calendar year to which Common Area', 'Maintenance Costs relate.” Section 8.04.', '- 13 - However, section 8.03(c) specifically provides that the calculation of “Common Area Maintenance Costs shall not include: * * * Taxes.” Adopting Cinemaworld’s formula would ostensibly render section 8.03 internally inconsistent with the provisions of the lease that relate to the allocation of real estate taxes and would effectively negate the separate assessment of the Common Area Maintenance Costs from the separate assessment of real estate taxes.', 'See Andrukiewicz v. Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d 235, 239 (R.I. 2004) (An interpretation that reduces certain words of a contract to mere surplusage should be rejected.). While we do not agree with Cinemaworld’s contention that the lease is unambiguous with respect to the allocation of real estate taxes, we recognize that it is conceivable that both parties intended the allocation of “real estate taxes” to be based on the leasable square footage—a formula similar to that which Inland had originally championed. See D.T.P., Inc., 576 A.2d at 1382 (the construction placed upon the terms of a contract by the parties serves as an aid in determining their intended meaning); see also In re Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 977 n.3 (R.I. 2006) (“[T]he parties’ subsequent course of performance may be instructive in contract interpretation.” quoting Reed & Reed, Inc. v. Weeks Marine, Inc., 431 F.3d 384, 388 (1st Cir. 2005)). However, we leave it to the trier of fact to determine what significance, if any, this may have on the computation method intended by the parties.', 'Ultimately, after reviewing the interpretations of the lease presented by both parties, and the somewhat amorphous language of the lease itself, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Because we are unable to determine at this stage which of the reasonable but conflicting interpretations of the lease the parties intended, those issues of material fact must be resolved by a trier of fact. See Rotelli, 686 A.2d at 95 (“When a contract is ambiguous, and the pleadings, discovery materials, and affidavits indicate a dispute in respect to the parties’ intent,', '- 14 - there exists a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved by the trier of fact.”). Accordingly, it is our opinion that the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment in this case.', 'B', 'Interest, Penalties, Expenses, and Attorneys’ Fees', 'Inland also argues that the lease requires that Cinemaworld pay additional amounts as a result of its late payment of real estate taxes, pursuant to Article 3, sections 3.02 and 3.03 and Article 23, section 23.02 of the lease. 6 However, because our review of the record indicates that 6', 'Article 3, section 3.02 of the lease provides:', '“INTEREST.

The constituent elements of this consolidated appeal to this Court are as follows: a petition for certiorari filed by Thomas Lonardo & Associates, Inc. in a mechanics‟ lien case and two appeals taken by the same corporation in connection with a separate receivership action. We must decide whether the motion justice in the Superior Court abused his discretion when he allowed Petra Finance, LLC to file an untimely statement of claim', '-1- in the mechanics‟ lien action. Because Petra failed to set forth any evidence tending to show that its untimely filing was the result of “excusable neglect,” we reverse the motion justice‟s ruling.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 6, 2006, Rhode Island Construction Services, Inc. (RICS) purchased real estate located at 618 Main Street in Coventry (the property). RICS planned on transforming an old mill complex on the property into a mixed-use development (the project). In connection with the financing of its purchase of the property, RICS executed a note in the principal amount of $1,456,000 to Zurich Mortgage Solutions, LLC (Zurich); the note was secured by a mortgage on the property. On October 20, 2006, Zurich recorded the mortgage in the land evidence records of the Town of Coventry. On that same day, American Residential Equities, LLC (ARE) purchased the note and mortgage from Zurich. ARE did not, however, immediately record the assignment of the mortgage.', 'Meanwhile, on September 12, 2006, Thomas Lonardo & Associates, Inc. (TLA) entered into a contract with RICS to provide architectural and engineering services for the project. Over a year later, TLA recorded two documents in the land evidence records in Coventry related to its work on the project: (1) a “Notice of Intention to do Work or Furnish Materials, or Both” (recorded on September 14, 2007) and (2) a notice of lis pendens (recorded on September 18, 2007).1 Also on September 18, TLA filed a petition to enforce its mechanics‟ lien in the Superior Court for Kent County. In that petition, TLA alleged that RICS owed $778,112.67 for 1', 'Pursuant to the mechanics‟ lien statute, a claimant must record a notice of intent and a notice of lis pendens in order to perfect the claimant‟s lien. See G.L. 1956 §§ 34-28-4; 34-28-7; 34-28-10.', '-2- “professional architectural services rendered” on the project. At the time TLA filed its petition, ARE still had not recorded the October 20, 2006 assignment from Zurich.', 'In a letter dated October 4, 2007, TLA notified Zurich (which was still listed as the mortgage holder in the land evidence records) that it had filed the mechanics‟ lien petition pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 28 of title 34. The letter enclosed a mechanics‟ lien citation issued by the clerk of the Superior Court. The citation informed Zurich that it should respond to the mechanics‟ lien petition “on or before the 26th day of October 2007.” The October 4 letter also advised Zurich “to make whatever claim it deem[ed] appropriate * * * to protect its interest in connection with” the mechanics‟ lien litigation.', 'Pursuant to § 34-28-16(a), claimants with an interest in the property were required to enter an appearance in TLA‟s mechanics‟ lien litigation within twenty days of October 26, 2007 (the return date provided for in the mechanics‟ lien citation) in order to preserve the priority of their claims. If the claimants failed to enter an appearance, their claims would be “subordinated to the claim of” TLA.2 See § 34-28-16(a). Nothing was filed with the court by any claimant within those twenty days.', 'Months later, on February 4, 2008, ARE finally recorded the October 20, 2006 assignment of the mortgage. Ten days later, on February 14, 2008, Petra purchased the note and mortgage from ARE. Petra waited until March 20, 2008 to record the assignment. 2', 'Section 34-28-16(a) provides, in pertinent part, that a', '“mortgage * * * shall be subordinated to the claim of the plaintiff,', 'and persons claiming liens pursuant to this chapter, and any other', 'person having any mortgage, attachment, or other lien or', 'encumbrance who have entered an appearance as a party in the', 'cause, unless the person shall within twenty (20) days after the', 'return day, or within such other time as may be allowed by the', '[S]uperior [C]ourt pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court', 'Rules of Civil Procedure enter an appearance as a party in the', 'cause commenced by the complaint * * *.”', '-3-', 'Meanwhile, on March 19, 2008, the court entered a stipulated consent order signed by both RICS and TLA in the mechanics‟ lien litigation. At that point, no other claimants had filed a response to TLA‟s petition. The consent order stated, inter alia: (1) that TLA‟s contract with RICS was “legally valid, binding and enforceable”; (2) that TLA had performed “the prescribed scope of work described in the [c]ontract, and further, [had] substantially performed in accord with the terms and conditions as set forth in said [c]ontract”; and (3) that TLA was “currently due and owing [$778,112.67] * * * for work performed under the [c]ontract.” The consent order also “acknowledge[d]” that TLA‟s mechanics‟ lien was “a valid lien and valid in amount.”', 'On May 12, 2008, RICS conveyed the property to Harris Mill, LLC. The next day, RICS filed a petition in the Superior Court for Kent County, requesting that the court place Harris Mill and the property into receivership.3 Petra appeared at hearings on May 13 and 14 concerning the appointment of a receiver. According to the affidavit of Petra‟s consultant, David Lloyd Merrill, Petra first learned of TLA‟s mechanics‟ lien petition during those receivership hearings.4 The court issued an order appointing a temporary receiver on May 14. In that order, the court also stayed all judicial proceedings “against [Harris Mill] or any of its property.”', 'On July 30, 2008 (some two-and-a-half months after it learned of the mechanics‟ lien proceedings), Petra finally entered an appearance in that litigation; it filed a motion to file an answer and statement of claim out of time. TLA objected, and the court conducted a hearing on Petra‟s motion on September 19, 2008. 3', 'The receivership petition indicates that Rhode Island Construction Services, Inc. was the sole member of Harris Mill, LLC. 4', 'The affidavit of Petra‟s consultant, David Lloyd Merrill, was filed in connection with the mechanics‟ lien proceedings.', '-4-', 'On November 7, 2008, the court in the mechanics‟ lien litigation issued a written decision granting Petra‟s motion to file its answer and statement of claim out of time. The motion justice recognized that § 34-28-16 allows the Superior Court to restore late claims in mechanics‟ lien actions if the claimant can show that its failure to file was due to “excusable neglect” as referenced in Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion justice found that Petra acted “quickly and diligently” once it received notice of the mechanics‟ lien proceedings and that Petra‟s failure to file a timely claim “was not the result of its carelessness, inattention or willful disregard.” On the basis of those findings, the court granted Petra‟s motion to file its answer and statement of claim out of time.', 'On September 10, 2009, the property was sold through the receivership action at a public auction; Petra was the highest bidder, and the order authorizing the sale was entered on September 28, 2009, nunc pro tunc to July 30, 2009. On September 29, 2009, TLA filed a notice of appeal5 from that order. On October 19, 2010, the court in the receivership action entered an “Order Accepting and Approving Permanent Receiver‟s Second and Final Report and Request for Fees.” TLA also filed a notice of appeal from that order.', 'On December 1, 2010, TLA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with respect to the mechanics‟ lien proceedings. On March 9, 2011, this Court entered an order granting the writ and consolidating the three appeals.', 'During oral argument before this Court, the parties informed the Court that they had entered into an agreement which laudably simplifies much of the procedural complexity involved in this consolidated appeal.', 'The agreement—which the parties submitted to the Court— acknowledges that Petra was the successful bidder for the property at the receivership auction on 5', 'TLA filed its appeal pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7, which allows for a party to appeal from a court order authorizing the sale of real property.', '-5- September 10, 2009. The agreement further provides that, at the closing of the sale, Petra would “deposit * * * $200,000.00 into escrow * * * pending the resolution of” this consolidated appeal. The parties also agreed that, if “the priority of [TLA‟s] Mechanic‟s Lien is restored, then * * * TLA shall be entitled to the Escrowed Funds.” Similarly, the agreement states that, if “the priority of [TLA‟s] Mechanic‟s Lien is not restored, then, [Petra] shall be entitled to the Escrowed Funds.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In a mechanics‟ lien action, a motion justice may grant a motion to submit a claim out of time “as may be allowed by” Rule 60(b). Section 34-28-16(a). Accordingly, a decision to grant such relief “is addressed to the [motion] justice‟s sound judicial discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal, absent a showing of abuse of discretion.” Keystone Elevator Co. v. Johnson & Wales University, 850 A.2d 912, 916 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'While the procedural history of this case is rather labyrinthine, the issue before us is narrow. TLA argues that the motion justice committed reversible error when he allowed Petra to file its answer and statement of claim in the mechanics‟ lien action out of time. Specifically, TLA contends that Petra did not establish that its failure to file a timely statement of claim was the result of “excusable neglect.” We agree with TLA.', 'Section 34-28-16(a) provides that, in a mechanics‟ lien action, a mortgagee‟s claim “shall be subordinated to the claim of the [mechanics‟ lien] plaintiff” if the mortgagee fails to enter a timely appearance. The mortgagee must enter its appearance “within twenty (20) days after the', '-6- return day [provided for in the mechanics‟ lien citation], or within such other time as may be allowed by the [S]uperior [C]ourt pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.” Rule 60(b) provides, in pertinent part, that a court “may relieve a party * * * from a final judgment, order, or proceeding” if that party can demonstrate “excusable neglect.” The burden of proving excusable neglect is on the moving party. Reyes v. Providence Place Group, L.L.C., 853 A.2d 1242, 1248 (R.I. 2004).', 'In this case, it is undisputed that Petra did not file an answer to the petition within twenty days of October 26, 2007 (the return date provided for in the mechanics‟ lien citation); it did not do so until July 30, 2008. Nevertheless, the motion justice held that Petra‟s failure to file a timely statement of claim was the result of “excusable neglect” as that term is used in the Rule 60(b) context. The court therefore granted Petra‟s motion and allowed it to file its statement of claim 278 days late—thereby restoring the mortgage‟s priority over TLA‟s mechanics‟ lien.', 'In our opinion, the motion justice committed reversible error when he found that the failure to submit a timely statement of claim was the result of Petra‟s excusable neglect. This Court has stated that “unexplained neglect, standing alone and without more,” is not enough for a party to be granted relief under Rule 60(b). Iddings v. McBurney, 657 A.2d 550, 553 (R.I. 1995). Rather, a party must demonstrate “excusable neglect,” which is “a failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in consequence of the party‟s own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident * * *.” The Astors‟ Beechwood v. People Coal Co., 659 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Boranian v. Richer, 983 A.2d 834, 840 (R.I. 2009) (“[T]o establish excusable neglect, the party generally must show that the circumstances that caused the party to miss a deadline were out of that party or counsel‟s', '-7- control.”). The inquiry into whether there has been excusable neglect “is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party‟s omission.” Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 960 A.2d 216, 225 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Petra purchased the note and mortgage from ARE on February 14, 2008—almost five months after TLA filed the mechanics‟ lien petition and more than three months after the deadline to file a statement of claim had passed. Had Petra carried out even the most cursory due diligence before it purchased the mortgage, it would have discovered that the property was implicated in the mechanics‟ lien action. A title search would have revealed the notice of lis pendens—a document recorded specifically “to warn any person subsequently dealing with the title to the land.” See G.L. 1956 § 9-4-9(a). As we have previously stated:', '“A notice of lis pendens is filed on the public record for the', 'purpose of warning all interested persons that the title to the', 'subject property is being disputed in litigation and that, therefore,', 'any person who subsequently acquires an interest in the property', 'does so subject to the risk of being bound by an adverse judgment', 'in the pending case.” Montecalvo v. Mandarelli, 682 A.2d 918,', '924 (R.I. 1996).6', 'Petra did not present any evidence that it had researched the status of the mortgage or the property prior to its purchase. In the affidavit filed by Petra‟s consultant, he freely admitted that Petra “had absolutely no knowledge of [the mechanics‟ lien] proceeding prior to its acquisition of the Note and Mortgage.” The consultant‟s affidavit, however, failed to offer any reason as to why Petra should be entitled to relief for “excusable neglect” based on this ignorance. 6', 'Cf. George v. Oakhurst Realty, Inc., 414 A.2d 471, 474 (R.I. 1980) (“The term „lis pendens‟ literally means litigation or suit pending, * * * and its effect has been summed up in these words: that he who purchases property pending a suit in which the title to it is involved, takes it subject to the judgment or decree that may be passed in such suit against the person from whom he purchases.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).', '-8-', 'Instead, it appears that Petra was willing to take its chances by purchasing a $1,456,000 mortgage without determining whether there were competing claims to the underlying property. It is a basic legal principle that an assignee “takes no greater right under [an] assignment than the assignor had when he made it.” In re Rider, 16 R.I. 271, 273, 15 A. 72, 73 (1888); see also 6 Am. Jur. 2d Assignments § 108 at 228 (2008) (“As a general rule, an assignee takes the subject of the assignment with all the rights and remedies possessed by or available to the assignor.”). ARE was the owner of the mortgage at the time of the expiration of the twenty-day period that is set forth in § 34-28-16(a). Accordingly, when Petra purchased the mortgage from ARE, it purchased an asset that had already lost its priority. See In re Rider, 16 R.I. at 273, 15 A. at 73. We perceive no equities in this case that would justify endowing Petra with a more valuable asset than the one it purchased from ARE—especially when information about the value of the mortgage would have been readily available had Petra performed a title search. See Pleasant Management, LLC, 960 A.2d at 225 (stating that the inquiry into whether there has been excusable neglect “is at bottom an equitable one” (internal quotation marks omitted)).', 'We have held that a party cannot demonstrate excusable neglect based on its “own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court.”', 'The Astors‟ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115 (internal quotation marks omitted). The outcome of this case might well have been different if Petra had been able to show that, before purchasing the mortgage, it had conducted a title search and, for some reason, that search failed to reveal the notice of lis pendens. If that were the case, Petra would be in a much better position to contend that it purchased the mortgage with a reasonable belief that the mortgage‟s priority was intact. But there is no such evidence; instead, Petra‟s failure seems to have been based on its “own', '-9- carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court.” See id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The motion justice focused on Petra‟s behavior after its risky purchase, noting that it acted “quickly and diligently” once it received notice of the mechanics‟ lien. The motion justice further stated that he was “hard-pressed to find any neglect on Petra‟s part at all.” Likewise, Petra argues that, “[a]t every turn after acquiring its interest in the Property, Petra diligently sought to protect its rights.” (Emphasis added.)', 'The motion justice and Petra agree that Petra acted diligently after it purchased the mortgage. But, at that point, the mortgage had already lost its priority—a fact that Petra should have known. By its motion to file an answer and statement of claim out of time, Petra was essentially seeking to protect a right that it never had in the first place. See In re Rider, 16 R.I. at 273, 15 A. at 73 (noting that an assignee “takes no greater right under [an] assignment than the assignor had when he made it”).', 'The motion justice‟s ruling awarded Petra a more valuable asset (viz., a mortgage with its priority intact) than the asset that Petra should have known it was purchasing (viz., a mortgage subordinate to TLA‟s mechanics‟ lien). In our opinion, there is nothing in the record to support the motion justice‟s determination that Petra had made a showing of “excusable neglect.”7 7', 'Petra also argues that “TLA‟s appeal must be dismissed as it does not have a valid mechanic‟s lien pursuant to” § 34-28-7. In our opinion, this argument is unavailing for the same reasons as have been discussed in the body of this opinion. Pursuant to § 34-28-14, “all persons who have [a] recorded * * * mortgage” are required to appear “on [the return date provided for in the mechanics‟ lien citation] and show cause, if any they have, why the [petitioner‟s] lien should not be allowed and enforced for the amount claimed.” Neither Zurich nor ARE—the prior mortgage holders—entered an appearance to challenge TLA‟s mechanics‟ lien before the return date (viz., October 26, 2007). In fact, Petra did not contest the validity of the mechanics‟ lien until September 26, 2008, when it filed a supplemental memorandum of law in support of its motion to file a statement of claim out of time. We perceive nothing in the record that would persuade us to entertain Petra‟s untimely argument.

Price, was convicted by a jury of one count of possession of marijuana and two counts of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver while armed with or having available a firearm. On appeal, Price contends that the trial justice committed three errors, each of which, he maintains, entitles him to a new trial. First, the defendant argues that the trial justice incorrectly interpreted the meaning of the phrase “having available any firearm,” within G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3. Secondly, he avers that the trial justice erroneously permitted the state to impeach the defendant’s credibility with an allegation of previous criminal conduct and with information that was false and prejudicial. Finally, Price argues that the trial justice violated the defendant’s constitutional right to make an informed decision regarding whether to plead or proceed to trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On March 26, 2009, Thomas J.

Officer Louis Gianfrancesco testified that, while searching a blue storage bin in the bedroom closet, 4 he found a blue leather handbag containing two firearms—a .45-caliber handgun and a .380-caliber handgun.

On June 8, 2009, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant and Washington each with seven criminal counts. 6 Ms. Washington entered into a plea agreement with the state, and defendant proceeded to trial.', 'During a pretrial hearing held on October 19, 2009, it came to light that federal charges had also been filed against defendant and that the state had extended a plea offer to him under which, if he filed a motion with the federal government stating his intent to plead on the federal case, the state would dismiss its case against defendant. The defendant, however, had rejected that offer. The state also had offered to recommend a sentence of ten years, with two years to serve, in exchange for defendant’s plea to one of the firearm charges. The defendant refused to accept that plea offer as well.', 'A seven-day jury trial commenced on October 22, 2009, which resulted in a verdict of: (1) not guilty of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver; (2) guilty of the lesser included offense of marijuana possession; (3) guilty of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver it when being armed with or having available a .45-caliber handgun; and (4) guilty of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver it when being armed with or having available a .380-caliber handgun. The defendant moved for a new trial, and the trial justice denied that motion. On January 8, 2010, defendant was sentenced to a term of seven years to serve on “racked a round back,” which means he ejected the round that was in the chamber and then put it back. This process took approximately twenty seconds, and the second round then fired. 6', 'The seven counts within the criminal information were: (count 1) possession with the intent to deliver cocaine; (count 2) conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to deliver; (count 3) conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to deliver; (count 4) unlawful possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver; (count 5) possession of cocaine; (counts 6 and 7) commission of a crime of violence—possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver while armed with or having available a firearm.', '-3- counts 6 and 7 (the firearm-related charges, to run concurrently with each other) and to one year suspended, with probation, on count 5 (the marijuana possession charge, to run consecutively to counts 6 and 7).

The defendant then presented a defense and testified before resting.

Specifically, defendant 7', 'Although defendant prematurely filed his notice of appeal before final judgment was entered, this Court will treat the appeal as timely filed. See State v.

The uncontroverted evidence, he maintains, demonstrates that the two firearms were located in a woman’s purse, covered by clothing and other items inside a large, plastic storage bin in a closet approximately six to eight feet from defendant’s bed. Moreover, defendant points out that he was not present at the apartment when the guns were discovered.', 'In denying defendant’s motion, the trial justice noted that both firearms were operable, that a clip with live cartridges and a full box of live cartridges were also found within the purse and that crack cocaine was found within close proximity of the closet. Significantly, defendant did not renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of his own case.', 'This Court previously has stated that, for us to consider an appeal of a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(a), the issue must have been properly preserved by the defendant for appellate review. State v. Tower, 984 A.2d 40, 45 (R.I. 2009). In this case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s case; however, he did not renew this motion at the close of his own presentation of evidence. “We consistently have held that the failure to renew a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence forecloses the defendant’s right to appeal the denial.” Id.; see also State v. Grullon, 117 R.I. 682, 689, 371 A.2d 265, 268-69 (1977) (“If defendant wanted to preserve this argument for appellate review, then he would have had to either renew the motion after the presentation of all the evidence or rest his own case at the time he made the motion[,]” and, “[t]herefore, the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, being within the discretion of the trial justice, is not 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-3 states, in relevant part, that “[n]o person shall commit or attempt to commit a crime of violence when armed with or having available any firearm * * *.”', '-5- reviewable in this [C]ourt.”). As such, defendant’s argument concerning the denial of his Rule 29 motion has been waived. 10', 'B', 'Improper Impeachment Evidence', 'At trial, Price’s defense to the charges of possession with the intent to distribute was that he suffered from a drug addiction and that, therefore, the cocaine and marijuana found in his apartment were for his personal use rather than for sale. To support this claim, defendant testified on his own behalf and admitted, on direct examination, that he “had got caught with drugs in the past,” “had an addiction,” and had been “placed on 18 months probation for the crack.” Consequently, during his cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned defendant about his criminal history:', '“[Prosecutor:] You’ve never sold marijuana?', '“[Defendant:] Have I?

Therefore, according to defendant, the trial justice erred in permitting the state to impeach his credibility by questioning him about an incorrect disposition of a prior possession charge (an eighteen-month suspended sentence) and by asking him about a non-existent criminal charge (possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver) because “there was no factual basis for either of the * * * erroneous and misleading questions posed by the prosecutor.”', 'The state counters that, even if the prosecutor’s question regarding the suspended sentence is considered error, it did not harm defendant’s case because members of the jury likely did not understand the distinction between a suspended sentence and probation and, also, because the trial justice provided a cautionary instruction. 11 With regard to the prosecutor’s mention of the incorrect criminal charge, the state contends that defendant’s argument is barred on appeal because his objection was not timely and, further, that defendant was not prejudiced by 11', 'We note, however, that the trial justice did not provide such an instruction until later in the trial when defense counsel again asked defendant about his prior conviction on redirect examination.', '-7- this line of questioning as the jury had already heard defendant’s response: “No. I was charged with simple possession.”', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The defendant’s principal assertion on appeal is that “[t]he trial judge, apparently misunderstanding both the falsity of the assumed facts in the state’s questions * * * and the substance of the defense attorney’s objections, sat by as a spectator and permitted the prosecutor’s egregiously inappropriate cross-examination without appropriate intervention, much to [defendant’s] great detriment.”', 'It is axiomatic that a witness’s credibility may be challenged by evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime, but that, generally, prior criminal conduct not amounting to a conviction or previous criminal charges are not admissible to impeach a witness. See G.L. 1956 § 9-17-15 (“[A] conviction or sentence for any crime or misdemeanor may be shown to affect [a witness’s] credibility.”); Rule 609(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record.”); Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.”); see also State v. Christofaro, 70 R.I. 57, 63, 37 A.2d 163, 166 (1944) (finding reversible error where the state referred to an arrest because it “exceeded the bounds of fair cross-examination”).', '-8-', 'This Court has previously stated that “evidence of unrelated, prior crimes is irrelevant and inherently prejudicial,” State v. Gallagher, 654 A.2d 1206, 1211 (R.I. 1995), and is, therefore, “deemed inadmissible in order ‘to prevent a jury from finding a defendant guilty based upon unrelated crimes rather than upon the evidence pertaining to the charged offense.’” Id. (quoting State v. Cardoza, 465 A.2d 200, 202 (R.I. 1983)). We also have stated that “the credibility of a witness may not be impeached merely by a showing of an arrest or criminal accusation.” State v. Sepe, 122 R.I. 560, 566, 410 A.2d 127, 131 (1980). Evidence of “other crimes” may be admissible under Rule 404(b), however, for such purposes as “proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.”', 'We are well satisfied that the three questions at issue in this case were improper and inappropriate for impeachment purposes.', 'In particular, we are troubled by the questions concerning the nature of the offense with which defendant was previously charged. Not only did these questions place factually incorrect information before the jury, they also impermissibly introduced false evidence of defendant’s previous criminal conduct. The only evidence properly admissible for the purpose of attacking defendant’s credibility under Rule 609(a) was evidence that he had been convicted of a crime. 12', 'The implication that defendant was previously charged with a crime without an evidentiary basis for that suggestion is patently improper.

On the contrary, we believe that the questions as posed were significantly prejudicial to defendant. The false information provided by the prosecutor, viz., that defendant was charged “with possession with intent to deliver crack cocaine,” was virtually identical to the charge for which he was standing trial, albeit without the element “when armed with or having available any firearm.” See § 11-47-3. The fact that the party introducing this false evidence was the state’s prosecuting authority, and presumably a repository of defendant’s criminal record, only exacerbated the prejudice to defendant.', 'At trial, defendant provided a defense to the two counts of having available a firearm while being in possession of cocaine with intent to deliver stating that he was a user, not a dealer. The prosecutor’s questions implied that defendant had been initially charged in a previous case with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. This false information could only heighten the already serious likelihood that the jury would use this evidence for improper propensity-based purposes.', 'The state seemingly acknowledges that the questions concerning the crime with which defendant was previously charged were without “factual basis,” but it argues that defendant was not prejudiced thereby because the jury heard the first such question without objection. Further, the state contends prejudice to defendant was lacking because the jury heard defendant’s “favorable” response: “No. I was charged with simple possession.”', '- 10 -', 'In order to adequately preserve an issue concerning the admissibility of evidence for appellate review, a litigant must articulate a timely and specific objection at trial. State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 936 (R.I. 2005) (holding that the defendant’s failure to “make a timely and specific objection” precluded his argument on appeal). In the instant case, we are satisfied that the issue has indeed been preserved. When prompted by the trial justice to state the basis of his objection to the question concerning defendant’s sentence of “18 months’ [sic] suspended sentence and probation for possession of crack cocaine,” defense counsel responded, “It was 18 months’ [sic] probation,” thus clearly objecting to the factual predicate of the question. The trial justice apparently misapprehended the nature of the objection, stating that defendant had “brought it out.”', 'The prosecutor then asked defendant whether the initial charge was for possession with the intent to deliver crack cocaine, and defendant responded that it was for “simple possession.” The prosecutor immediately repeated the inaccurate question, at which point defense counsel objected; however, the trial justice did not rule on the objection before defendant retreated from his initial response, instead saying, “I don’t know.” The trial justice then abruptly terminated this line of questioning by stating: “The answer is, ‘I don’t know.’ Let’s move on.” Thus, defendant’s final answer to the state’s erroneous question heard by the jury was “I don’t know.” In light of the significant likelihood of prejudice embodied in the relatively short colloquy, we conclude that the trial justice erred by not sustaining defendant’s objection and by not giving an immediate cautionary instruction to the jury.', 'When a defendant is testifying at his trial, prosecutors and trial justices must be scrupulous to ensure that impeachment of defendant by reference to prior convictions or past criminal conduct is effected in a proper manner and based on true facts. In Christofaro, 70 R.I. at 63, 37 A.2d at 166, this Court recognized that improperly placing evidence before the jury of', '- 11 - the defendant’s prior arrests or charges under the guise of impeachment could not be considered harmless error because “the presumption of [the] defendant’s innocence should not be adversely affected by the injection in evidence of extraneous matter which has no probative value on the real issue in the case.” Here, the jury watched as the prosecutor—the attorney for the state— dismissively ignored defendant’s denial to her initial question and asked the question again. Even after defense counsel objected but before the trial justice ruled on the objection, the prosecutor pressed further, leading and confusing defendant as she implored him with the terse question: “Right?” to answer differently than he just had answered. The defendant’s confusion is evident from his subsequent answer of “I don’t know.” This sequence of questioning raises a serious concern that defendant’s initial denial of that charge was undermined in the jury’s eyes and did nothing to cure the error that occurred when the trial justice allowed defendant’s final answer to stand over defense counsel’s objection. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction. 13', 'C', 'Defendant’s Right to Make an Informed Decision', 'The defendant’s third contention of error is that he was incorrectly informed by the trial justice that, if he rejected the state’s plea offer and proceeded to trial, he would be tried on only a single count—count 6, which alleged possession of cocaine with intent to deliver when armed with or having available a firearm. This misinformation, he argues, violated his “constitutional right to make an informed decision whether or not to proceed to trial or plead nolo contendere.” 13', 'We express no opinion as to whether the first question regarding defendant being placed on an eighteen-month suspended sentence alone would have warranted the judgment of conviction being vacated.', '- 12 - He urges this Court to vacate his conviction on all counts and grant him a new trial on count 6 alone.', 'The colloquy at issue occurred at a hearing on October 19, 2009—two days before a jury trial was scheduled to commence. The transcript of the hearing discloses that defense counsel advised the trial justice that the state had offered to recommend a sentence of ten years imprisonment with two years to serve if defendant pled to one of the gun counts; all other counts would then be dismissed. The trial justice thereupon confirmed with the prosecutor that the state had agreed to accept a plea to an amended count 6 in exchange for dismissing all other counts. The trial justice then addressed defendant directly, stating:', '“If you do not wish to take advantage of [the offer presented by the', 'state], that, instead, it is your desire to go to trial on count 6 as', 'presently alleged; namely, having committed a crime of violence,', 'which under the statute includes possession with intent to deliver', 'cocaine, while armed with or having available a firearm, that’s the', 'single charge that the State intends to pursue at trial.”', 'At the next hearing, on October 21, 2009, when the case was reached for trial, the trial justice said:', '“The first matter I want to take up relates to the various', 'charges that are in the information. The State has decided to go', 'forward on some of them and to dismiss others, or at least not', 'proceed on them because of a matter that’s pending in Federal', 'Court. We had a conference with counsel after our last session, in', 'chambers, and, at that time, [the prosecutor] did not have the file in', 'its entirety with her. We went over some of the counts, and I think', 'we identified -- and you correct me if I’m wrong, counsel -- that', 'the State would proceed on counts 3, 4, 6 and 7 at that trial.” The prosecutor confirmed the trial justice’s understanding, and defendant did not object or attempt to correct the trial justice; indeed, both defendant and defense counsel remained silent. The trial justice offered no further commentary about the plea negotiations, but, rather, immediately entertained several pretrial motions.', '- 13 -', 'We also note that defendant did not object when, during the voir dire, the trial justice and prosecutor explained to prospective jurors on several occasions that defendant was being charged with three counts, two of which involved the possession of firearms. Moreover, defense counsel even informed the jury during the voir dire that it would have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant “possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute that substance, while at the same time * * * having possessed a firearm” for each of “counts 6 and 7.” It was not until defendant moved for a new trial after the jury’s verdict that defendant posited that “it was his impression that he was going forward on one of the * * * gun charges, and not both of them,” explaining that his belief was that, “if he were to plea to one of the gun charges, the other one would be dismissed.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that, because “[a] defendant has a constitutional right to a trial,” he “concomitantly [has] a right to decide whether or not to proceed to trial or to plead.” He further cites to Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure to support his contention that “the choice between pleading guilty and proceeding to trial must be an informed one, and an accurately informed one at that.”', 'Rule 11 states:', '“A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of', 'the court, nolo contendere. The court may refuse to accept a plea', 'of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or a plea of nolo', 'contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and', 'determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of', 'the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.

Although a defendant’s right to proceed to trial is constitutionally protected, this does not concomitantly confer upon a defendant the right to enter into a plea agreement or require that a trial justice ensure that a defendant voluntarily and with knowledge rejected a plea offer when he instead decides to proceed to trial.', 'The trial justice was very clear as to which counts the state would prosecute at trial and no objection was made when the trial justice clarified those counts with the prosecutor. Even within defendant’s motion for a new trial, the argument proffered was that it was defendant’s belief that the state would only be “going forward on one of the * * * gun charges, and not both of them” because “that was part of the plea bargain[—]that if he were to plead to one of the gun charges, the other one would be dismissed.” The defendant rejected the plea bargain offered by the state, however.', 'We are satisfied that the defendant was fully aware of the counts for which he was being tried and that the argument he now presses on appeal was raised for the first time only after the jury had rendered its verdict. Accordingly, we discern no reason to restrict his retrial on remand to count 6 only.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we conclude that the trial justice erred and that this error was not harmless.

(father), appeals from a Family Court termination of parental rights with respect to his daughter, Evelyn C. 1 Specifically, father contends that the trial justice erred in concluding that he has a substance- abuse problem that renders him unable to care for Evelyn. He further argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s determination that it was unlikely that Evelyn could be returned to him within a reasonable amount of time. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after a review of the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Heather C.

Evelyn was treated for cocaine withdrawal and subsequently placed in foster care. Shelly Marshall, a social caseworker for the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF or department), testified that she opened a case focusing on the custody and care of Evelyn after the hospital called the department in Rhode Island to report Evelyn’s and Heather’s positive drug tests.', 'Ms. Marshall testified that she first met with the parents on July 25, 2008, at which time she discussed the permanency time frames and requested that they sign the related disclosure. 2 Although mother was compliant with this request, Marshall stated that “father refused to look at the form and sign it.” According to the social worker, her assessment at that time was that both parents needed substance-abuse treatment and mental-health care. 3 The parents’ next visit with Marshall took place on August 1, 2008. Mother and father planned on moving to Massachusetts, so Marshall discussed the parents’ wishes to seek services in that state rather than in Rhode Island. She informed them that “it would be very difficult if not impossible for [her] to really assist them” with services being obtained outside of Rhode Island. Ms. Marshall testified that, had the parents remained in Rhode Island, she would have referred them to CODAC, a substance-abuse treatment center and to the Access to Recovery Program. During the parents’ visit with Evelyn on that same day, Marshall noticed a lot of tension within the parents’ relationship because of rude comments they made to each other, with father often “just taking it.” 2', 'Ms. Marshall stated that the permanency time frame is a federal guideline that “advise[s] parents that we have certain time frames that we need to adhere to and that children can only be in care for a certain amount of time and that parents have within that window to do what they need to do in order to get their child back.” Further, she said that “if a child is in care for 12 months and the parents are nowhere near reunification then the department per federal guidelines is required to file a termination of parental rights.” 3', 'Ms. Marshall’s concern for father stemmed from his “marijuana use of 18 years.”', '-2- Ms. Marshall stated that this type of interaction was constant between them and that addressing this problem became part of the case plan.', 'Ms. Marshall stated that, at the next visit, on August 7, 2008, father “disclosed some pretty significant abuse by his stepfather and mother.” She testified that he also told her that he had not smoked marijuana in over thirty days but was “really struggling” with abstaining from it because it calmed him down. Ms. Marshall stated that she suggested that he see a psychiatrist and that father was “pretty receptive” to this idea.', 'Ms. Marshall reported that father arrived at her office unannounced on August 25, 2008. She stated that he said he was distraught because mother had been arrested for shoplifting the night before. According to Marshall, when she asked father why he stayed with mother when she treated him so badly, he replied that he has a “mommy complex” and that Heather is “mom” to him. Ms. Marshall testified that she told father that he “really needs to get it together in order to get his child back.”', 'During that meeting, Marshall stated, they also discussed father’s substance-abuse issue, namely his use of marijuana; father indicated that he had been very stressed and had used marijuana. Ms. Marshall testified that she told him to call CODAC for treatment.', 'Ms. Marshall stated that she prepared separate case plans for the parents in September 2008. Father’s case plan called for him to, inter alia: obtain gainful employment, find housing, participate in a substance-abuse evaluation, stop using all illegal substances, engage in a sober- parenting class, address his past abuse through counseling, engage in couples counseling, and engage in a psychiatric evaluation aimed toward considering his need for medication for anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, father was to tend to criminal charges pending against him, which, according to Marshall, stemmed from an arrest', '-3- in Rhode Island for possession of marijuana. Ms. Marshall stated that she attempted to refer father for substance-abuse treatment in Rhode Island, but that he refused her offer because he wished to remain in treatment at SSTAR in Fall River. 4', 'The second case plan, dated July 15, 2009, was similar to the first. Father was to obtain employment, find housing, engage in counseling, refrain from using illegal substances, engage in a sober-parenting class, and comply with any court-imposed requirements related to criminal charges. Ms. Marshall indicated that she also informed the parents that, if they chose to live outside of Rhode Island, an ICPC 5 with the receiving state would have to be initiated and approved before reunification could occur.', 'Ms. Marshall stated that father engaged in a parenting class at SSTAR, receiving a certificate of completion in December 2009 for his participation in a class called “Healthy Fathering-Healthy Children Group.”', 'Describing her experiences with the parents during June of 2009, Marshall stated that the parents seemed to be doing well; they were receiving services at SSTAR and living in Fall River, and that a Massachusetts caseworker had been working with the family. During a visit on June 9, 2009, she stated that she informed the parents that an ICPC that had been submitted to Massachusetts was still pending, but that it appeared as though Evelyn would be sent home to her parents. On July 14, 2009, during a telephone call to SSTAR, Marshall was informed that the parents had signed only a limited release for information so the parents’ counselor could no longer talk to her. Subsequently, mother informed Marshall that she had relapsed, testing positive for cocaine, benzoids, and marijuana in late May and early June of 2009.

According to Marshall, father claimed that he was not aware that mother was using drugs again.', 'According to Marshall, during a meeting with the parents in August 2009, father told her that he was doing intensive outpatient treatment at SSTAR. Ms. Marshall stated that she told the parents that there was no longer any room for error and that, if they could not “get it together,” the department would file a petition to terminate their parental rights. Describing the parents’ visitation with Evelyn, Marshall stated that mother did most of the parenting while father often watched television or sat back and let mother care for the child. Ms. Marshall testified that, when she encouraged father to interact with Evelyn during visits, to play with her and hold her, he told her that he did not like to hold children unless they are sick.', 'An administrative review was held on January 13, 2010, at which time, according to Marshall, mother had again tested positive for cocaine and, although living together at the time, father denied that he was aware of mother’s relapse. Ms. Marshall testified that father again stated that he did not believe children should be held, admitted that he did not know how to care for his daughter’s needs, and indicated that Evelyn “is the mama’s baby.” During a conversation with father on January 27, 2010, Marshall attested, he told her that he would be looking for an apartment in Rhode Island, that he and mother were no longer together, and that he would like to visit Evelyn by himself. Ms. Marshall stated that she told him that she was still concerned about his interactions with Evelyn and that his expectations of the child were inappropriate for her age; however, father told her that mother “is the nurturer,” while “he would be the provider.” Ms. Marshall also stated that, although the department had provided separate times for visitation, the parents always got back together and arrived at the visits together. At a visit on February 9, 2010, mother was not in treatment and the parents did not have an apartment.', '-5-', 'Ms. Marshall discussed a referral that she made in February or March of 2010 for father to participate in a parenting program at the Children’s Museum. She stated that father was not accepted to the program because, during an intake interview, he stated that he did not need to learn anything and he asked the interviewer whether she had any children; when she refused to answer, he indicated that she could not teach him anything if she had no children.', 'A third case plan was put into effect in May 2010 that contained the same objectives as the 2008 case plan, which, Marshall stated, showed that father had not made much progress while the case was open. Ms. Marshall testified that she reviewed the case plans with both parents during a meeting on July 20, 2010, and, although the goal was still reunification, a termination petition was discussed. Ms. Marshall testified that father told her that he had done everything that he needed to do; she added that she informed him that he had not been consistent with his mental-health or substance-abuse treatment and that he continually chose mother over the child.', 'At the time of trial, Marshall testified that mother was in Tennessee, had not seen Evelyn for four months, and was willing to consent to an open adoption. Ms. Marshall stated that Evelyn was currently two and one-half years old and had been living in the same foster home since birth. She testified that Evelyn was doing well and had bonded with her foster parents, who were willing to adopt her. Further, she stated that it was her belief that it was in Evelyn’s best interests to be adopted by the foster parents.', 'Nancy Granshaw, a clinician employed by SSTAR in Fall River, testified that she began providing services to father in July 2008 and was still seeing him at the time of trial. The goal of his treatment plan was to address “issues of co-dependency in his relationship with [mother], and to meet the requirements of the [DCYF] plan for him to complete the requirements of the service', '-6- plan and also to address his own past issues and to reduce his harm from substance abuse.” Speaking of father’s “[c]annabis dependence,” Granshaw testified that she worked with him individually, that he had completed an intensive outpatient program, and that he actively participated in a relapse-prevention group. Ms. Granshaw stated that, although she did not have any drug screens for father, he self-reported that he had used marijuana as recently as March 2011, as well as in May, July, August, September, and December of 2010. In the year prior, he had been clean and sober for nine or ten months, but his use had increased within the last six months before the time of the trial. Ms. Granshaw testified that father still attends the relapse- prevention group and is “very appropriate” in that group.', 'Ms. Granshaw also testified as to father’s co-dependency issues, explaining that father reported that mother was physically and verbally abusive toward him on many occasions, but that he had “this need to be with her.” According to Granshaw, when a person is involved in an abusive relationship, it is very difficult to recover from substance dependency. She testified that, during his treatment, father also disclosed that he had suffered childhood sexual abuse at the hands of his stepfather as well as physical abuse by both his mother and his stepfather. “Treatment progressed slowly,” stated Granshaw, partly because “so many sessions were spent calming down the latest crisis” between him and mother, but also because of his difficulty in being able to focus and concentrate due to a diagnosis of ADHD.', 'Ms. Granshaw testified that she discussed father’s role as a parent with him and, in her opinion, if father gained custody of Evelyn, he would need “[p]retty significant services” as a support. She further explained that father had focused on his problems with mother for so long, that treatment time for other issues was minimal.', 'When asked whether these issues—co-', '-7- dependency, childhood trauma, and his ongoing substance abuse—would affect his ability to parent, Granshaw attested that they would currently have a negative effect on his parenting.', 'Although father refused to sign a release for his treatment records from SSTAR, they were ultimately admitted as a full exhibit at trial. Those records indicate that, at the outset of his therapy, father admitted to his counselor that he was a “pot head” and estimated that he spent $40 per day on his marijuana habit. The records track father’s progress over the course of more than two years of counseling and participation in group sessions and show father’s insistence on continuing to use marijuana.', 'Gina Corsetti, a child-support technician for DCYF, responsible for transporting children in the foster care system to visits with their parents and supervising those visits, testified regarding Evelyn’s visits with her parents. Ms. Corsetti testified about a visit that took place at the Providence Place Mall on December 29, 2009, at which time the parents arrived fifteen minutes late and “were all over the place.” She stated that mother was yelling at father and it was “kind of chaotic.” When asked how often this sort of thing happened, Corsetti replied: “Usually every visit.” Ms. Corsetti testified that, when the visits took place at the Bristol office of DCYF, mother would take toys out to play with Evelyn, but father mostly just sat on the floor and watched movies. Ms. Corsetti indicated that there was not much interaction between father and Evelyn when mother was present.', 'When Corsetti was asked whether the visits had progressed between December 2009 and December 2010, she replied that they had become worse because of the frequent bickering between mother and father in front of Evelyn.', 'Ms. Corsetti testified that father has visited with Evelyn alone since January 2011. Although her notes indicated that father was “very appropriate” at a visit on January 25, 2011, on the March 8, 2011 visit, Evelyn threw a tantrum and father, rather than comforting her, stated', '-8- that Evelyn was “going to have to get used to him because when she is sick after [being returned to him], he is going to be all she has and that * * * she needs to get used to not feeling well around him.” After describing several more visits, Corsetti was asked whether there had been any improvement in the interaction between father and Evelyn since January 2011, and she answered that there had not.', 'Paula Toland, from the “Families Together” program at the Providence Children’s Museum, testified regarding her observations of father. She stated that both parents had been referred to the program in January 2010 by Shelly Marshall; however, mother was eventually rejected because she had not been clean and sober and in active treatment for thirty days. Ms. Toland testified that she observed several visits between the parents and Evelyn, beginning on January 19, 2010. She noted, first, that while mother exhibited strong parenting skills, father needed “significantly more support in most areas.” Ms. Toland stated that father’s “interaction and his parenting were * * * inconsistent” because he “needed significant direction in how to talk to” Evelyn and play with her at an age-appropriate level. She reported that father interacted with Evelyn more as a peer than as a parent.', 'Ms. Toland testified that father was accepted to the museum program and assigned to one of the program’s clinicians, Amanda Grandchamp. However, his acceptance was rescinded due to several concerns that arose after father made certain statements to Grandchamp during a meeting.', 'Ms. Toland also stated that she agreed with the department’s decision to file a termination petition based upon “Evelyn’s age and the length of time she had been in [the department’s] care.”', 'Father testified on his own behalf, and stated that he was not aware that mother had been using drugs at the time of Evelyn’s birth. He admitted that he had used marijuana “[a]t least five', '-9- times” since Evelyn’s birth and, on cross-examination, that he had seven marijuana convictions over the years. He stated that he was “kind of self-employed” as a boat painter, worked for several companies, and had been married and divorced five times. Declaring that he had “a great relationship with [his] daughter,” he requested that the termination petition be denied.', 'The trial justice issued a written decision in which she reviewed the evidence and set forth her findings of fact. She found that father “had many failed attempts to remain substance free” and that he had not been able to parent and bond with Evelyn, although DCYF had made reasonable efforts to provide him with services. The trial justice determined that “[f]ather’s failure to successfully complete and outright reject parenting services offered at all times * * *, his inability to remain substance free, along with his failure to address his relationship and past abuse renders him unable to unify with his child.”', 'The trial justice found that both parents were unfit due to chronic drug use. She noted father’s history of chronic substance abuse and a substantial criminal record related to drug possession and use, and she stated that he “continued to smoke marijuana continuously during the reunification process.” The trial justice determined that father was unfit due to his failure to address issues related to his history of abuse and co-dependency and that he failed to improve his parenting skills, despite having participated in parenting classes. The trial justice also found that Evelyn had been in DCYF custody for at least twelve months and, that, despite the department’s efforts, her return to her parents within a reasonable time was not likely, considering her age and need for a permanent home. The trial justice concluded:', '“Both of these parents are chronic drug users who have let it', 'overtake them and their ability to be a parent to their child. * * *', 'Unconditional love and support for a child are shown through the', 'efforts that one undertakes to show that one is worthy of the honor', 'of being called a parent.

That day, she interviewed Morin, his wife, Elizabeth, and their children, including Sally.', 'According to Brandstromskelding, DCYF received a phone call from a police officer on the following day “notifying us of concerns that a mother and daughter had brought to his attention.” Two days later, on September 28, 1992, Brandstromskelding returned to Morin‟s home.', 'She first spoke with Sally, who told her that Morin had molested her. Brandstromskelding then asked Morin if this was true. Morin eventually admitted to her that “he had done some of these things to [Sally]” and described this behavior as a “habit.”', 'Brandstromskelding testified that, during this conversation with Morin, his wife was “in and out of the kitchen,” where they were speaking, and that she was listening in from time to time. At some point, Brandstromskelding called the police to report that Morin had admitted to molesting Sally. After Morin‟s wife became “agitated” and slammed the blade of a “very large butcher knife” into the kitchen table in front of Morin, Brandstromskelding called the police a second time and asked them to come immediately. 6', 'At the time of the suppression hearing, Det. Dicomitis was employed as a detective with the Rhode Island State Police.', '-3-', 'About two minutes after Brandstromskelding placed the second phone call to the police, Officer Green arrived at Morin‟s home.7 Brandstromskelding greeted him at the front door and spoke with him outside. She told him about what Sally and Morin had both revealed to her and about how Morin‟s wife had reacted by slamming the knife into the table. Officer Green then entered the residence and placed Morin under arrest. According to Brandstromskelding, Officer Green read Morin his Miranda rights upon arresting him.', 'Detective Dicomitis testified that, in 1992, he was a detective with the Warren police department. On September 28, 1992, Det. Dicomitis advised Morin of his Miranda rights by having him read and sign a standardized form. After Morin waived his Miranda rights, Det. Dicomitis took a statement from him at the police station. In that statement, which was admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing, Morin said that he had touched Sally‟s vagina on several occasions over the previous six months. He explained that he had stopped doing this “sometime [sic] ago” because “[t]here was no thrill” in it for him.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, Morin argued that his statement to police should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest. He urged the trial justice to reject New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), in which the United States Supreme Court declined to apply the exclusionary rule to statements obtained after a warrantless arrest in a home. In response, the prosecutor argued that Harris should control the trial justice‟s decision. He also suggested that, under the factors articulated in State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983), the exclusionary rule should not apply to Morin‟s statement to police. 7', 'It appears that Officer Green was identified only by his surname in the record. He did not testify at the suppression hearing; the prosecutor advised the court that “without refreshing his recollection from documents,” Officer Green was unable to remember “anything” about Morin‟s arrest.', '-4-', 'The trial justice stated that Harris “ought to control.” He found that Officer Green “[p]lainly” had “probable cause to arrest [Morin].” Crediting Brandstromskelding‟s testimony regarding the confrontation between Morin and his wife, the trial justice found that Officer Green “would have truly been derelict in his responsibilities if he did not act as he acted [in arresting Morin].” Having concluded that Morin was legally arrested, the trial justice heard argument regarding whether Morin had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. He then concluded that the prosecution', '“ha[d] satisfied its burden [to prove] by clear and convincing', 'evidence that [Morin] comprehended all of his Miranda rights and', 'voluntarily, without coercion of any kind on the part of the police,', 'decided to speak with the [police], and that his decision was a', 'product of his free and intelligent choice.” Accordingly, he denied Morin‟s motion to suppress his statement to the police.', 'Morin then moved to redact certain portions of that statement. Specifically, he sought to redact the portion of the statement in which he had told police that he had sought counseling in the past and that he “wish[ed] to seek further counseling” in connection with his sexual habits. Additionally, he also asked the trial justice to redact two lines of the statement containing extremely crude language.8 The trial justice rejected Morin‟s argument that he would be unfairly prejudiced if the jury were allowed to consider the statement in its entirety. The case then proceeded to trial.', 'B', 'Trial', 'Jury selection began and concluded on November 2, 2009. That day, the state dismissed count 3 under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Counts 1 and 2 8', 'We discuss the pertinent portion of Morin‟s statement in part III-B, infra.', '-5- (first- and second-degree child molestation, respectively) were tried before a jury on November 3-4, 2009. The state presented testimony from three witnesses: Sally, Brandstromskelding, and Det. Dicomitis.', 'Sally was the first witness to testify. In September 1992, she was eight years old and lived with her mother, her younger siblings, and her stepfather, Morin. She testified that she and her siblings would sometimes play “the naked game,” which she described as “just get[ting] naked and run[ning] around like, you know, kids do.” She described an incident that occurred sometime in or around September 1992, when she was playing the naked game with her siblings in the living room. That day, when she was naked and sitting on Morin‟s lap, Morin touched her vagina and digitally penetrated her.', 'Sally described another incident that occurred around the same time period. After she had a bad dream, Morin got into bed with her. At first, Sally testified that she “[didn‟t] really -- know if [Morin] touched [her] or not.” When asked where Morin‟s hands were during that incident, Sally said that she “[didn‟t] really remember too much, but maybe like around my waist.” Later, however, she testified that he had rubbed her vagina over her undergarments.', 'In September 1992, Sally testified, she told her babysitter (whose name she could not recall) about what had happened with Morin. She also remembered speaking with someone named Marta about the abuse. She testified that she did not tell her mother about the incidents of molestation because she “didn‟t think that [her mother] would believe [her].”', 'On cross-examination, Sally stated that she did not remember anything about meeting with Brandstromskelding, even after Morin‟s counsel attempted to refresh her recollection by having her review Brandstromskelding‟s notes of their conversation. Sally also admitted that,', '-6- during a pretrial proceeding, she had not mentioned the incident in the bedroom. She did not recall going to the police station and speaking with Det. Dicomitis on September 28, 1992.', 'Because the trial testimony of Brandstromskelding and Det. Dicomitis largely mirrored their testimony at the suppression hearing, we discuss the relevant portions of their trial testimony in our analysis rather than summarize their testimony in this portion of the opinion. On cross-examination, both Brandstromskelding and Det. Dicomitis testified that Sally had not told them about the incident in which Morin touched her in her bedroom.', 'Over Morin‟s objection, his statement to police was admitted as a full exhibit through Det. Dicomitis.', 'The state then rested. After the trial justice denied Morin‟s motion for a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, Morin rested as well. On November 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict, finding Morin guilty on count 1 and not guilty on count 2.', 'Morin filed a motion for a new trial on November 17, 2009, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.9 The trial justice heard arguments on that motion on January 27, 2010. Morin argued that the jury‟s verdict—guilty on count 1 and not guilty on count 2—was “confused * * * and perhaps * * * logically inconsistent.” In response, the prosecutor suggested that Morin‟s “acquittal on count 2 provides an additional measure of comfort in the verdict itself.”', 'The trial justice stated that he was “well satisfied that [Sally‟s] claim of digital penetration was truthful.”', 'He also indicated that he was “completely satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Morin] engaged in this activity specifically for the purpose of sexual 9', 'On December 17, 2009, one month after filing his original motion for a new trial, Morin filed an amended motion for a new trial. Because Morin withdrew this amended motion on January 27, 2010, when the trial justice heard arguments on his original motion for a new trial, we do not address it.', '-7- gratification or arousal.” Furthermore, he agreed with the prosecutor that Morin‟s acquittal on count 2 strengthened, rather than weakened, his confidence in the verdict. The trial justice concluded that, “based upon [his] independent assessment of the evidence, * * * [Morin] was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to the charge of first-degree child molestation as alleged.” Accordingly, he denied Morin‟s motion for a new trial.', 'At a hearing on March 24, 2010, the trial justice sentenced Morin to forty years imprisonment, with fifteen years to serve and twenty-five years suspended, with probation. Judgment of conviction entered on June 14, 2010. Morin timely appealed to this Court.10', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Morin raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, which was directed at the statement he gave to Det. Dicomitis. As he did below, he contends that this statement should be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest.', 'Second, he maintains that the trial justice should have redacted a portion of that statement, which he describes as “irrelevant and highly prejudicial.” Lastly, Morin argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. We address each of his contentions in turn. 10', 'Appeals filed prior to the entry of final judgment are considered timely. See State v. DeRobbio, 62 A.3d 1113, 1118 n.7 (R.I. 2013) (citing Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011)).', '-8-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', 'In Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576 (1980), the United States Supreme Court held that “the Fourth Amendment * * * prohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect‟s home in order to make a routine felony arrest.” Relying on Payton, Morin argues that the trial justice should have suppressed his statement to police as the fruit of an illegal arrest. Although Payton, 445 U.S. at 590, explicitly authorized warrantless in- home arrests made under “exigent circumstances,” Morin contends that the trial justice did not “explicitly” find that exigent circumstances justified his arrest.', 'Although the trial justice did not make an explicit finding of exigent circumstances, our review of the record shows that this finding was implicit in his decision to deny Morin‟s motion to suppress. The trial justice characterized Brandstromskelding as “a detached state officer” and credited her description of the confrontation that ensued at Morin‟s residence after his wife learned that he had admitted to molesting Sally. He also credited her testimony that she called police and requested them to come immediately after Morin‟s wife slammed a butcher knife into the kitchen table. He found that “with the overall heightened concern that had arisen out of violence, * * * [Officer Green] would have truly been derelict in his responsibilities if he did not act as he acted [in arresting Morin].”', 'Likewise, we conclude that exigent circumstances justified Morin‟s warrantless arrest in his home. Officer Green had received information that a violent confrontation had taken place and that Morin‟s wife was (quite understandably) enraged after finding out that Morin had', '-9- molested Sally. As the trial justice noted, Morin‟s admissions to Brandstromskelding, which she relayed to police, “[p]lainly” furnished probable cause to arrest him. The trial justice further observed that “if anybody was to be removed [from the house] at that point, it seems to me it would have been [Morin], who had caused the escalation of the violence as a result of [his] statements * * *.” In these circumstances, Officer Green must have “ha[d] a reasonable belief that his assistance [was] required to avert a crisis.”11 See State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 313 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359, 1362 (R.I. 1984)); see also State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1137 (R.I. 2004) (“This Court is mindful that police are in the emergency service business and they usually have little or no time to leisurely consider their options or engage in protracted evaluation.”).', 'Morin also urges this Court to reject New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), in which the United States Supreme Court declined to apply the exclusionary rule to statements obtained after a warrantless arrest in violation of Payton. In light of our conclusion that Morin was validly arrested under Payton because exigent circumstances existed, we need not consider whether the Rhode Island constitution requires us to apply a broader exclusionary rule. See In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2006) (“Neither this Court nor the Superior Court should decide constitutional issues unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.”); see also State v. Werner, 615 A.2d 1010, 1014 (R.I. 1992) (“[S]tate courts should respect the manner in which [the Fourth Amendment] is interpreted by the Supreme Court.”). 11', 'In most cases, the testimony of the arresting officer should provide the basis for the conclusion that he or she reasonably believed that exigent circumstances existed. Under the facts of this case, we conclude that, although Officer Green did not testify at the suppression hearing, “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [his] action[s]” because Brandstromskelding‟s testimony sufficiently demonstrated the existence of exigent circumstances. See Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 404 (2006) (quoting Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 138 (1978)).', '- 10 -', 'Although Morin argues that the trial justice should have suppressed his statement to police as the fruit of an unlawful arrest, he has not pressed on appeal any additional grounds for suppression. Because we hold that Morin was validly arrested, and because we perceive no error with the trial justice‟s conclusion that Morin knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his Miranda rights, we affirm his decision to deny Morin‟s suppression motion.', 'B', 'Redaction', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence allows a trial justice to exclude relevant evidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.” “[A] trial justice‟s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly.” State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008). He or she must exclude evidence that is “marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial.” Id. This Court will affirm a trial justice‟s evidentiary ruling under Rule 403 “absent an abuse of discretion.” DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883.', 'Morin moved to redact portions of his statement which contained references to counseling; he also requested redaction of two lines which contained crude language. The pertinent portion of his statement, including those two lines, is below:', '“Q: You freely admit that you have sexually touched your', 'daughter [Sally] and you feel that it is a problem that you', 'have. Is this statement correct [?]', '“A: Yes. And that I wish to seek further counseling.', '“ * * *', '“Q: Have you ever sort [sic] counseling before [?]', '“A: Yes, through the mental health center.

I just wanted to stop it. I stopped it all on my own.”', 'After Morin argued that he would be unfairly prejudiced if the trial justice admitted his statement to police without redacting the portion of his statement reproduced above, the trial justice stated:', '“I think it‟s part and parcel and relevant to what he', 'says. He * * * says the reason [he sought] counseling was,', '* * * for „paper pussy‟ magazines; and, the officer says,', 'what do you mean by that? He says, it‟s to cut out and', 'masturbate with them. And, in the same breath he says, I', 'wanted to stop that and I stopped it on my own. The officer', 'says, why did you touch the children? And, he says,', 'because it was something new.', '“I think these statements are quite relevant to the', 'rest of the statement; I‟m not going to redact them at all.', 'The motion to redact is denied.”', 'Having considered the contested portion in the context of Morin‟s entire statement, as well as the remainder of the evidence against him—including Sally‟s damning testimony—we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the statement in its entirety. Regarding the reference to “paper pussy,” any prejudice that may have inhered to Morin from that crass and offensive phrase was undoubtedly overshadowed by the most prejudicial aspect of his statement: his admission that he had molested his stepdaughter. While that phrase may well have raised some eyebrows among the jury, Morin‟s explanation of why he molested Sally— because “[i]t was something new” after he stopped masturbating to pornographic magazines— was highly relevant evidence. Furthermore, as the trial justice recognized, the references to counseling were “part and parcel” of Morin‟s explanation of his behavior.', 'Morin claims that “[t]he distinct possibility existed that the jurors would be so disturbed by learning of [his] private sexual activities, legal though they might be, that they would be unfairly prejudiced against him and fail to analyze the evidence in an objective manner.”', '- 12 - However, his acquittal on count 2 proves that the jury did, in fact, analyze the evidence objectively. The trial justice did not err in refusing to redact Morin‟s statement to police.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', '“When deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror.” State v. Navarro, 33 A.3d 147, 156 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640-41 (R.I. 2011)). “The trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). If the trial justice has set forth sufficient reasoning to support his or her ruling, this Court “accord[s] great weight” to that ruling on appeal. Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). We will not reverse the trial justice‟s decision unless “we are convinced that [he or she] committed clear error or * * * overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Id. at 156- 57 (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641).', 'Morin argues that “[Sally‟s] testimony as to the first[-]degree molestation was too vague to support a conviction” and that she “was not a credible witness.” We disagree. Sally did have some difficulty remembering the details of the bedroom incident; presumably, this is why the jury acquitted Morin on count 2. However, her testimony regarding the first molestation incident in the living room reflected a painfully clear memory. She clearly stated that Morin “put them [his fingers] in [her].”', 'We discern no error with the trial justice‟s decision to deny Morin‟s motion for a new trial. The trial justice correctly articulated and thoughtfully applied the applicable standard for', '- 13 - that decision. He credited Sally‟s testimony that Morin had digitally penetrated her and found that he had done so “specifically for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal.” He also noted that Morin‟s acquittal on count 2 strengthened his confidence in the verdict. Because we conclude that the trial justice did not commit clear error and neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence, we cannot disturb his decision to deny Morin‟s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 14 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

The defendant, Eugene Friedrich, appeals from a Superior Court judgment awarding damages in the amount of $61,258.05 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $90,532.39 and costs to the plaintiff, Greensleeves, Inc. (Greensleeves or Meyer). On appeal, Friedrich contends that the trial justice erred in (1) finding that he had tortiously interfered with Greensleeves’s contract; and (2) denying his motion to amend the judgment to reduce the award of prejudgment interest.', 'After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we find no reversible error on the part of the trial justice and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'We have become abundantly familiar with the facts and tortured procedural history of this case. The uninitiated reader is directed to this Court’s prior decision in Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284 (R.I. 2007) (Greensleeves II). With that in mind, we briefly discuss the facts pertinent to this appeal.', '-1-', 'Elizabeth Meyer is the sole shareholder and chief executive officer of Greensleeves. 1 In 1993, Meyer purchased land and acquired condominium dock slips at Lee’s Wharf Marina in Newport (Lee’s Wharf). In 1995, Philip B. Smiley, Sr. contacted his real estate broker, Joseph W. Acetta, in an effort to sell six of his dock slips at Lee’s Wharf. Aware that Meyer had previously bid on these dock slips at a prior auction, Acetta then contacted her regarding a potential sale. 2 Their negotiations proved successful. On May 24, 1995, Acetta sent a letter to Meyer’s attorney outlining the negotiated agreement whereby Smiley agreed to sell the dock slips to Greensleeves for $165,000, which was to be paid on the date of the closing. Thereafter, Greensleeves and Smiley orally agreed to treat that letter as the purchase and sale agreement, rather than draft a formal agreement. The closing was set for June 14, 1995.', 'On the heels of that agreement, on June 9, 1995, Smiley entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Friedrich for the sale of those same dock slips (Smiley-Friedrich contract). They negotiated a sale price of $175,000—$10,000 more than Smiley had negotiated with Meyer— which included a $20,000 down payment in cash. The closing was set for June 15, 1995. Suffice it to say, Smiley refused to convey the dock slips to Greensleeves, in direct contravention of their earlier agreement.', 'Greensleeves then immediately filed suit against Smiley in the Newport County Superior Court, seeking specific performance of its agreement with Smiley. Additionally, Greensleeves filed a notice of lis pendens on the dock slips in the land evidence records of the City of Newport. Friedrich then intervened, pursuant to Rule 24 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and moved to dismiss the complaint. The hearing justice found that Acetta’s May 24, 1995 letter to Meyer’s attorney did not satisfy the statute of frauds and declared that there was no 1', 'We refer to Meyer and Greensleeves interchangeably throughout this opinion. 2', 'The record reveals that Friedrich had also bid on these dock slips on three separate occasions.', '-2- enforceable contract between Greensleeves and Smiley.', 'On August 11, 1995, he granted judgment in favor of Smiley and Friedrich and granted Smiley’s motion to strike the lis pendens notice. Later that day, Smiley conveyed the dock slips to Friedrich, pursuant to their contract.', 'Greensleeves then timely appealed to this Court.', 'We vacated the judgment of the Superior Court, holding that there was an enforceable contract between Greensleeves and Smiley because the May 24, 1995, letter “contained all the elements necessary to constitute a contract” for the sale of the dock slips. Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 694 A.2d 714, 716 (R.I. 1997) (Greensleeves I). Accordingly, we remanded the case to the Superior Court. Id. at 717.', 'On remand, Greensleeves moved for summary judgment and sought specific performance of its agreement with Smiley. The hearing justice granted specific performance in favor of Greensleeves, on February 6, 1998. Friedrich appealed to this Court, and in an unpublished order dated January 15, 1999, we affirmed the hearing justice’s ruling. Thereafter, Friedrich relinquished his ownership of the dock slips, which were then appropriately conveyed to Greensleeves. In the meantime, Greensleeves sought an accounting of the rental income that had been collected from the dock slips from June 14, 1995 (the date of the originally-scheduled closing between Greensleeves and Smiley) through the 1999 boating season.', 'A hearing was held on April 14, 2000, and the parties stipulated that the amount of rental income totaled $61,258.05. They also stipulated as to the amount of interest that Greensleeves had earned on the $165,000 it had retained due to the fact that its June 14, 1995 closing with Smiley never took place. The hearing justice then issued an order on May 16, 2000, ruling that, under the accounting principle prescribed in Bissonnette v. Hanton City Realty Corp., 529 A.2d 139 (R.I. 1987), “[t]he rent and profits earned by * * * Eugene Friedrich [were] to be offset by', '-3- interest on the purchase money.” 3 Thus, the hearing justice ruled that Greensleeves was not entitled to the lost rental profits.', 'Again, Greensleeves appealed to this Court. 4 On appeal, we examined the hearing justice’s application of the Bissonnette rule.', 'We agreed that the Bissonnette rule barred Greensleeves from collecting the lost rental profits as part of the specific performance remedy, and we noted that the compensation contemplated under the Bissonnette rule is “more like an accounting between the parties than an assessment of damages.” Greensleeves II, 942 A.2d at 293 (quoting Bissonnette, 529 A.2d at 143). However, we reversed the ruling concerning the remedy available for Greensleeves’s tortious interference of contract claim. Id. We held that the Bissonnette rule did not bar Greensleeves from collecting the lost rental profits under a claim of tortious interference of contract. Id. at 294. We stated that the case “may be remanded to the Superior Court” in order to determine whether Friedrich tortiously interfered with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract. Id.', 'On remand, a two-day bench trial commenced. It is the Superior Court’s decision on that remand that is now before this Court. The following (at times conflicting) facts were adduced. 3', 'In Bissonnette v. Hanton City Realty Corp., 529 A.2d 139 (R.I. 1987), we ruled that the remedy of specific performance of contract puts the buyer and seller in the position they would have been had they consummated the real estate closing on the date set forth in the contract. Id. at 143. Thus, the buyer is entitled to the rents and profits earned between that date and the date of the specific performance, and the seller is entitled to the interest earned on the purchase money during the same period. Id. 4', 'On February 8, 2002, in an unpublished order, this Court initially dismissed the appeal because final judgment had not entered with respect to all of the outstanding claims. We thus remanded the case to the Superior Court. Greensleeves then dismissed its remaining claims against Smiley. Smiley and Friedrich also dismissed their cross-claims against each other. Additionally, Greensleeves waived all other claims for damages against Friedrich. Thus, only Greensleeves’s tortious interference of contract claim against Friedrich remained viable. On remand, applying the law of the case doctrine, another justice ruled that Greensleeves was barred from recovering the lost rental profits as damages under its tortious interference of contract claim.', '-4-', 'Friedrich became a member of Lee’s Wharf in 1990, became a member of the board of directors in 1991, and served as president of the marina association from 1994 until 2005. In 1993, Meyer acquired land and dock slips at Lee’s Wharf.', 'In support of the claim that Friedrich tortiously interfered with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract, Meyer testified that she and Friedrich had an acrimonious relationship at the marina and that Friedrich was persistent in his efforts to “thwart whatever [she] was doing * * * in the marina association context.”', 'Further, she described her relationship with Friedrich as a “bewildering series of very negative and aggressive * * * attack[s]” by him against her. She further testified that, shortly after she first acquired dock slips at the marina, Friedrich prohibited the tenants using her dock slips from parking in the marina’s lot. Meyer attempted to raise this issue at the marina’s annual meeting; however, after Friedrich outright refused to put it on the agenda, she filed a lawsuit to enforce her parking lot rights. Lee’s Wharf then countersued, and Friedrich accused her of deliberately colluding to defraud the association of its right to park in another lot she owned on adjacent property. She ultimately prevailed on her claim, and the association’s counterclaim was denied.', 'Thereafter, according to Meyer, in 1994, the marina withheld the rental income due to her on the rentals of her dock slips. She protested to Friedrich, again to no avail. Nonetheless, despite not receiving her rental income, she testified that she continued to pay her dock slip fees. She then filed suit against the marina demanding payment of that rental income, and she again ultimately prevailed. 5', 'In response to Meyer’s testimony, Friedrich maintained that he did not have any “personal animosity” toward Meyer. However, he also testified that “there was always friction 5', 'The trial justice took judicial notice of both of the above-referenced lawsuits; both decisions were marked as full exhibits.', '-5- between Miss Meyer and the board,” and that he and the board harbored a belief that she was “trying to indirectly control the board.” He stated that, in the above-referenced interactions with Meyer, he acted in a representational capacity at the direction of the board, and not out of any personal dislike for Meyer. Indeed, at trial, Meyer likewise acknowledged that the complained- of interactions with Friedrich related to the marina association.', 'Turning to the facts surrounding the sale of the dock slips, Meyer testified that she and Smiley entered into negotiations regarding their sale in 1995.', 'On May 24, 1995, they summarized the negotiated terms in a letter, which this Court later deemed to be a valid and enforceable contract. See Greensleeves I, 694 A.2d at 716. Meyer further testified that, shortly thereafter, she had a conversation with William Bullard, the assistant dockmaster at Lee’s Wharf, in which she told him that she was buying Smiley’s dock slips.', 'Subsequently, when Smiley refused to consummate the closing on the dock slips in breach of their agreement, she again spoke with Bullard. She recalled that Bullard then told her: “[W]hen I told [Friedrich] that you were buying Smiley’s slips he ran down the dock * * *—first he said over my dead body, then he ran like a bat out of hell down the dock.” She testified that, Friedrich “had grabbed the slips out from under [her].”', 'Although Bullard did not testify at trial, his deposition was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit. Contrary to Meyer’s testimony, Bullard’s deposition did not reveal that Meyer had informed him about her agreement to purchase Smiley’s dock slips. Instead, Bullard stated that it was Smiley who told him that he was selling his dock slips to Meyer. Bullard testified that, after learning this, he informed Friedrich that Smiley had sold his dock slips to Meyer. 6 6', 'Bullard could not specifically recall how much time had lapsed between his conversation with Smiley and his later conversation with Friedrich, although he testified that “[i]t couldn’t have been long.”', '-6- According to Bullard, Friedrich “was astonished” to learn about the sale to Meyer, and at that point Friedrich “turned around and went back to his car and took off.”', 'Contrary to Bullard’s deposition testimony, on direct examination by Meyer’s counsel, Friedrich testified that Bullard had never informed him that Smiley was selling the dock slips. However, Friedrich was then impeached with his prior inconsistent deposition testimony. When asked at his deposition “what date” Bullard told him about the sale of the dock slips, Friedrich responded that it was June 7 or 8, 1995. Later at trial, on direct examination by his own counsel, he again contradicted his prior testimony. He testified that Bullard told him that Smiley was actively marketing the dock slips, but that Bullard would not tell him whom Smiley was dealing with or the negotiated price he had obtained. He further testified that, after that conversation with Bullard, he called Smiley and “chewed him out” for not letting him know that he was marketing the dock slips. He acknowledged that he had a longstanding interest in those dock slips and that he had previously had numerous communications with Smiley, in which he informed Smiley that he was “interested in buying” those dock slips. He testified that, well before the Greensleeves-Smiley contract, he thought the dock slips “looked like a good investment” and had (unsuccessfully) bid on them at three prior auctions.', 'According to Friedrich, in his phone conversation with Smiley, Smiley did not disclose whom he had been dealing with regarding the potential sale of the dock slips—only that he had a meeting scheduled for that night. Friedrich testified that, when he spoke again with Smiley the following day, Smiley informed him that “he had no deal with the other party.” Later that same day, he and Smiley signed an agreement for the sale of the dock slips, whereby he agreed to pay $175,000 for the dock slips, including a $20,000 cash deposit.', 'He testified that he paid the $20,000 cash deposit to Smiley on June 11, 1995.', '-7-', 'However, Friedrich was again impeached with a prior inconsistent statement he had offered in his deposition. Although Friedrich testified at trial that he did not know that Smiley was dealing with Meyer regarding the sale of the dock slips, his deposition testimony revealed that “[a]t some point * * * between the time that [he and Smiley] were drafting the purchase and sale agreement and [the time] [Smiley] came for the $20,000 deposit,” Smiley had told him that he had been dealing with Meyer regarding their sale.', 'Smiley was also called as a witness at trial. Contrary to Friedrich’s deposition testimony, Smiley testified that he did not inform Friedrich about his agreement to sell the dock slips to Meyer. However, Smiley was also impeached with his prior deposition testimony. At his deposition, he had testified that, on the day he and Friedrich executed their agreement for the sale of the dock slips, Friedrich knew that Meyer “was the person [Smiley] had been dealing with regarding the sale of [those] slips.” Additionally, in a pleading filed in the Superior Court in this case, 7 Smiley brought a cross-claim against Friedrich, alleging that Friedrich was “aware of Smiley’s negotiations with Greensleeves” and that Friedrich had “interfered with the relationship between Smiley and Greensleeves without legal justification to do so.”', 'At the conclusion of the bench trial, the trial justice found in Greensleeves’s favor on its tortious interference of contract claim. In a bench decision on February 25, 2010, the trial justice recited the elements of that claim, as identified in Belliveau Building Corp. v. O’Coin, 763 A.2d 622 (R.I. 2000): “(1) [T]he existence of a contract; (2) the alleged wrongdoer’s knowledge of the contract; (3) his [or her] intentional interference; and (4) damages resulting therefrom.” Id. at 627 (quoting Smith Development Corp. v. Bilow Enterprises, Inc., 112 R.I. 203, 211, 308 A.2d 477, 482 (1973)). 7', 'As noted above, Greensleeves had also named Smiley as a defendant in this case.', '-8-', 'The first element was satisfied, the trial justice noted, since this Court had already found that a valid contract existed between Greensleeves and Smiley for the sale of the dock slips. See Greensleeves I, 694 A.2d at 716. As to the second element, he found that “Friedrich was aware of Greensleeves’s contractual relations with Smiley to buy the [dock slips] on June 8, 1995.” Regarding the third element, he determined that Friedrich had “convinced * * * Smiley to break any contractual relationship with Greensleeves.”', 'Additionally, he found that Friedrich intentionally “undercut” the agreement already reached between Greensleeves and Smiley for the sale of the dock slips “because of his resentment of Meyer[,] * * * [whom] he saw * * * as a threat to his control of the association * * * at [the] [m]arina.”', 'Further, the trial justice stated that to prevail on a claim of tortious interference of contract, the interference must also be shown to be “improper.” He listed seven nonexclusive factors to consider in making that determination: “(1) [T]he nature of the actor’s conduct, (2) the actor’s motive, (3) the contractual interest with which the conduct interferes, (4) the interest sought to be advanced by the actor, (5) the balance of the social interest in protecting freedom of action of the actor and the contractual freedom of the * * * plaintiff, (6) the proximity of the actor’s conduct and the interference complained of, and (7) the parties’ relationship.” 8', 'In examining those factors, the trial justice found that the parties had an acrimonious relationship. He categorized Friedrich’s conduct as “covert and aggressive” in undermining Meyer’s ability to buy the dock slips, and classified Friedrich’s “personal animus” toward Meyer as his motive in doing so. He found that Friedrich opposed Greensleeves’s acquisition of the dock slips in order to thwart any increase in its voting interest in the association. Additionally, he found that the balancing of the social interest weighed in favor of Greensleeves because 8', 'In Belliveau Building Corp. v. O’Coin, 763 A.2d 622, 628 n.3 (R.I. 2000), we recited the above-referenced factors, citing the Restatement (Second) Torts § 767 at 26-27 (1979).', '-9- Friedrich interfered with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract immediately after he found out about the agreement, offering Smiley more money for the dock slips and $20,000 in cash. Considering all of the factors together, the trial justice ultimately concluded that Friedrich had tortiously interfered with the contract between Smiley and Greensleeves, and that Greensleeves was entitled to the lost rental profits of $61,258.05, plus interest and costs. Judgment entered on March 29, 2010. Friedrich then timely appealed to this Court.', 'During the pendency of the appeal, Friedrich moved to amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. He contended that, because Greensleeves had filed two unsuccessful appeals during the travel of the case, 9 which unnecessarily forestalled the progress of the case by twenty-nine months, the amount of prejudgment interest awarded should be accordingly reduced. Following a hearing on May 6, 2010, the trial justice denied that motion to amend, stating that he believed the prejudgment interest calculation was “fair and reasonable.” Thereafter, Friedrich amended his appeal to this Court to include an appeal from the trial justice’s denial of his Rule 59(e) motion.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Friedrich contends that the trial justice committed reversible error in finding that he tortiously interfered with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract. In his brief to this Court, he assails the trial justice’s decision in that regard, asserting that he “relied on matters not in evidence, misconceived the evidence that was in the record, was clearly wrong in his view of 9', 'Those two appeals were denied and dismissed by this Court. The first was an appeal from a Superior Court order denying Greensleeves’s motion for attorneys’ fees. We held that “[w]ithout a transcript * * * it [was] impossible to determine the basis for the trial justice’s decision.” Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 754 A.2d 102, 102-03 (R.I. 2000) (mem.). We dismissed the second appeal in an unpublished order. See note 4, supra.', '- 10 - some of the evidence, made findings of fact that [were] not supported by any evidence whatsoever, and made speculative findings far beyond the legitimate scope of the evidence.” He therefore asks this Court to reverse the trial justice’s decision or, in the alternative, to remand the case for a new trial. Additionally, he maintains that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) to reduce the prejudgment interest.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'We have consistently held that “[t]his Court’s review of the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury is deferential.” Pelletier v.

In deciding whether the interference was improper, this Court has articulated a list of non-exclusive factors for the trial justice to consider. The trial justice correctly recited those factors, which were summarized in Part I, supra.', 'Friedrich argues that the trial justice committed reversible error by considering matters outside of the record in finding him liable for tortious interference of contract. Specifically, he avers that the trial justice considered portions of deposition testimony provided by three witnesses—Smiley, Friedrich, and the attorney that had represented Meyer concerning the sale of 10', 'Here, there is no dispute that there was a valid and enforceable contract between Greensleeves and Smiley.

Parts of those depositions came in (1) as substantive evidence under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence; and (2) for impeachment purposes under Rule 613 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Additionally, portions of those depositions were used to refresh the recollection of the witnesses under Rule 612 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Friedrich contends that the trial justice reviewed and relied on portions of these depositions that had not been admitted into evidence. After conducting our own independent review of the record, we agree with Friedrich that the trial justice’s decision was clouded by references to matters outside of the record.', '“It is well settled that error inheres in the action of a trial justice who * * * relies either in whole or in part on matters not in evidence.” Marcotte v. Marcotte, 102 R.I. 312, 315, 230 A.2d 429, 430 (1967) (quoting Sargent v. Sargent, 93 R.I. 359, 363, 175 A.2d 551, 553 (1961)). However, such error is harmless and therefore not reversible if the trial justice relied on “ample evidence independent of the references [to matters outside the record] to support [his] ultimate decision * * *.” Thibaudeau, 947 A.2d at 247 (quoting Guertin v. Guertin, 870 A.2d 1011, 1018 (R.I. 2005)). Therefore, we must determine whether the “sum of the other evidence supporting the [trial] justice’s decision indicates to us that his consideration of the [matters outside the record] was not an inextricable component of his analysis of the case.” Id. at 246; see also State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 369 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]hen a trial justice has considered matters not in the record * * * any error committed by the trial justice is harmless” if “such evidence is cumulative, and if [liability] is established by other competent evidence.”). Although we believe it was imprudent for the trial justice to have committed the above-cited errors, we conclude that such errors were harmless. See Thibaudeau, 947 A.2d at 246, 247. In discussing each of the', '- 13 - complained-of errors, we explain why they are harmless with respect to the trial justice’s ultimate conclusion that Friedrich tortiously interfered with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract.', 'Friedrich ascribes error to the trial justice’s conclusion that he had knowledge of the Greensleeves-Smiley contract—a linchpin of a tortious interference of contract claim. In support of this contention, Friedrich asserts that the trial justice erroneously attributed the following statement to Bullard in determining that Friedrich had such knowledge: “Friedrich [ran] back to his car * * * in a hurried fashion, saying words to the effect of over his dead body” after Bullard informed Friedrich that Smiley was selling the dock slips to Meyer. The trial justice then incorrectly stated that Meyer later corroborated Bullard’s testimony in this regard. Our review of the record indicates that Meyer—not Bullard—testified to the above-referenced statement as worded. 11 Bullard’s testimony was slightly different. A close look at Bullard’s testimony indicates, though, that he did in fact tell Friedrich that Smiley was selling the dock slips to Meyer. Bullard stated that, when he told Friedrich that Smiley had sold his dock slips to Meyer, Friedrich was “astonished. He turned around and went back to his car and took off.”', 'Moreover, Friedrich testified that, after he learned that Smiley was selling the dock slips, he immediately called Smiley and “chewed him out.” Thereafter, Friedrich and Smiley signed a purchase and sale agreement, in which Friedrich agreed to pay Smiley $175,000 for the dock slips, which included a $20,000 cash payment. Although Friedrich testified at trial that he had never been informed that Smiley was selling the dock slips to Meyer, his prior deposition testimony told a different story. In his deposition, he acknowledged that he knew Smiley was dealing with Meyer regarding the sale of the dock slips. He stated that Smiley had so informed 11', 'Although Friedrich’s counsel objected to Meyer’s testimony at trial, Friedrich does not challenge the admission of this testimony on appeal.', '- 14 - him “[a]t some point * * * between the time that [he and Smiley] were drafting the purchase and sale agreement and [the time] [Smiley] came for the $20,000 deposit.”', 'Additionally, apart from the abundance of prior inconsistent statements that came to light at trial, 12 showing that Friedrich did indeed have knowledge of the Greensleeves-Smiley contract before he contracted with Smiley, the trial justice also took notice of Friedrich’s demeanor on the stand. He noted that, “[w]hile testifying [at trial], [Friedrich’s] demeanor when speaking about [Meyer] * * * evidenced more than just mere annoyance. * * * [H]is [temperament] and demeanor in [his] statements evidence[d] a [longstanding] personal dislike for her.” Further, the trial justice determined that Friedrich’s testimony on the stand was self-serving. Specifically, he observed that Friedrich sometimes had a “lapse of memory” at trial “when it was convenient for him.”', ""As we have consistently stated, “[t]he task of determining the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly the function of the trial justice when sitting without a jury.” Bogosian v.

(quoting Ferreira, 21 A.3d at 367).', 'Furthermore, Friedrich asserts that the trial justice drew improper inferences from extra- record testimony in finding that he had knowledge of the Greensleeves-Smiley contract. In support of this contention, Friedrich states that the trial justice went outside the record in finding that Smiley was the “proverbial snake in the grass” because Smiley was “in debt to DEPCO.”13 It is clear that references regarding Smiley’s financial situation with DEPCO appear only in deposition testimony outside the record.', 'Moreover, at trial, Meyer’s attorney, who had represented her in connection with the sale of the dock slips, testified that Smiley had asked him to prepare two separate purchase and sale agreements (one agreement for five of the dock slips, and another for the last dock slip). From this testimony, the trial justice then “infer[red]” that Smiley “wanted to essentially hide * * * the sale of * * * five [of the] [dock slips]” to defraud DEPCO out of the “lion’s share” of the sale proceeds.', 'In so inferring, he stated that, because Friedrich gave Smiley a $20,000 cash deposit for the sale of the dock slips, Smiley was “in cahoots” with Friedrich to “hide * * * or keep that out of the purchase and sale agreement or recorded documents.”', 'Thus, Friedrich ascribes error to the trial justice’s rejection of Smiley’s testimony at trial, in which he stated that he did not inform Friedrich that he was dealing with Meyer regarding the sale of the dock slips.

We take this opportunity to clarify that “illegal * * * means” is not an element of tortious interference of contract. Instead, as is abundantly apparent from our holding in Avilla, the means employed in so interfering must have been “improper.”', 'Id. at 97, 98.', 'Although motive in and of itself is insufficient to demonstrate an improper interference, motivation to interfere cannot be ignored.', 'Here, we believe that the record adequately demonstrates that Friedrich not only had a motive to interfere, but also that this motive was the driving factor of his interference. Knowing that Meyer had already contracted with Smiley, he offered Smiley $10,000 more than what Meyer had agreed to pay; additionally, Friedrich agreed to pay $20,000 of the purchase price in cash. There was sufficient evidence in the record for the trial justice to have found that, “[g]iven Friedrich’s personal animus toward Meyer,” Friedrich was motivated to interfere with the contract in order to prevent her from acquiring the dock slips. Friedrich stated at trial that “[t]here was always friction between * * * Meyer and the board” and that he and the board harbored a belief that Meyer had been trying to “indirectly control the board.” This testimony demonstrates that Friedrich considered Meyer a threat to his position at the marina. Additionally, given that Friedrich’s own deposition testimony, which was admitted into evidence at trial, revealed that he knew that Smiley and Meyer were engaged in a deal for the sale of the dock slips, we cannot say that the trial justice committed reversible error in citing to the above- referenced extra-record evidence. There was clearly cumulative record evidence to support the', '- 18 - trial justice’s determination that Friedrich intentionally and improperly interfered with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract.', 'Lastly, we address Friedrich’s contention that any evidence regarding Meyer’s above- referenced testimony pertaining to lawsuits regarding parking rights and payment of rental fees cannot be used to demonstrate any intentional interference with the Greensleeves-Smiley contract. He argues that such conduct is protected under this Court’s adoption of the Noerr- Pennington doctrine in the context of common-law tort claims. 14 See Hometown Properties, Inc. v.

Although Friedrich presents this Court with an interesting question— to wit, whether any conditional immunity attached to his conduct in his representational capacity at Lee’s Wharf, and if so, whether he may invoke that conditional immunity in this proceeding— we need not reach its merits because it is clear from the record that Friedrich has waived this argument.

26,Michael Bell : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. On a summer’s evening in June 2007, a group of young people assembled at Murphy Field in the City of Newport, not to play baseball, but to watch a fist fight. The pugilists were two young men, one from the City of Newport, and the other from the Town of Middletown. Michael Bell (applicant) was a spectator, along with several of his friends. A brawl broke out among the onlookers. Mr. Bell armed himself with a baseball bat, allegedly to defend a female friend who he thought was being threatened. In the aftermath of this melee, Bell was charged with and later convicted of felony assault.', 'The applicant appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. Specifically, the applicant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his claim that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by giving him “incorrect legal advice” that “ultimately deprived [him] of the opportunity to consider and accept a favorable plea offer.” For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Among the group that Bell claims was threatening his female friend was one Ian Kerr. Although Bell concedes that Kerr did not physically touch either him or his female friend, Bell struck Kerr in the side of the head with the baseball bat with sufficient force to fracture Kerr’s skull.', 'On October 18, 2007, Bell was arraigned in Newport Superior Court on an information alleging one count of felony assault. Bell was represented by defense attorneys Kevin Dwyer (counsel) and Rebecca Clarke. 1 A bench trial commenced on March 23, 2009 in the Superior Court. At that time, Dwyer discovered that the state intended to call two witnesses whose identities had not been disclosed to him. Attorney Dwyer sought and received a continuance in order to prepare for these new witnesses. The trial justice also ordered that the state obtain written witness statements from the two new witnesses, and continued the trial for nearly two months.', 'On May 18, 2009, trial resumed and, upon cross-examining one of the new witnesses, Dwyer learned for the first time that the witness had been arrested for vandalizing Bell’s truck on the night of the incident. Attorney Dwyer then moved for a mistrial on the basis of this newly discovered evidence. The trial justice ruled that the juvenile records of the witnesses were discoverable, and allowed a further continuance. Trial resumed on June 15, 2009, at which time counsel withdrew his motion for a mistrial. 1', 'Although Attorney Clarke was co-counsel at applicant’s criminal trial, she was not mentioned during applicant’s postconviction-relief hearing, and there has been no allegation that she gave ineffective assistance to Bell.', '-2-', 'Attorney Dwyer presented two affirmative defenses on Bell’s behalf: self-defense and defense of others. On July 1, 2009, the trial justice found Bell guilty of felony assault. Bell’s present counsel entered her appearance on his behalf on July 22, 2009, and on July 27, 2009, Dwyer withdrew from the case. On September 10, 2009, Bell was sentenced to fifteen years, with four to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions, eleven years suspended and eleven years probation. Bell initially appealed this decision, but later withdrew that appeal. 2', 'On February 24, 2010, Bell filed an application for postconviction relief. A hearing was held on November 8 and December 16, 2010 before the same justice as had presided over the trial. Bell, his mother, and Dwyer were the only witnesses who testified. On May 10, 2011, the trial justice filed a written decision denying Bell’s application for postconviction relief. On May 20, 2011, applicant filed a notice of appeal. Final judgment was entered by the court on September 21, 2011. 3', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In Rhode Island, “post-conviction relief is available to a defendant convicted of a crime who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights that the state or federal constitutions secured to him.” Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Gordon v. State, 18 A.3d 467, 473 (R.I. 2011)). This Court has previously stated that we “will not disturb a trial justice’s factual findings made on an application for post-conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material 2', 'The applicant asserts that he withdrew the appeal of his conviction because “[d]efense [c]ounsel had failed to preserve the significant appellate issues involved.” We have not been apprised of those issues. 3', 'Although applicant filed this appeal prior to the entry of final judgment, this Court will treat applicant’s premature appeal as timely. See Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011).', '-3- evidence in arriving at those findings.” Id. (quoting Gordon, 18 A.3d at 473). We will, however, “review de novo any post-conviction relief decision involving questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights.” Id. (quoting Gordon, 18 A.3d at 473).', 'In evaluating an application for postconviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, “[t]his Court adheres to the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 * * * (1984) * * *.” Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941 (quoting Rodriguez v. State, 941 A.2d 158, 162 (R.I. 2008)). To prevail on such a claim, the petitioner must satisfy the two prongs of the Strickland test: “[f]irst, the applicant must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient, to the point that the errors were so serious that trial counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). “This prong can be satisfied only by a showing that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). The second prong of Strickland “requires the applicant to demonstrate prejudice emanating from the attorney’s deficient performance such as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). “This prong is satisfied only when an applicant demonstrates that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. at 941-42 (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The applicant argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because his attorney gave him “incorrect legal advice,” which robbed him', '-4- of the opportunity to consider and accept a plea offer. The state counters that applicant cannot show that the prosecution ever made a plea offer, much less that he would have accepted it, given his stated desire to join the military. Further, the state contends that the trial justice would not have accepted a less than jail disposition because the sentencing benchmarks would assign some jail time.', 'An applicant bringing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can prevail only if he or she can meet both prongs of the test articulated in Strickland. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 14 n.7 (R.I. 2012). Accordingly, we will address each prong separately.', 'A', 'Objective Standard of Reasonableness', 'Under the first prong of Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, “the [applicant] must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.”', '“[T]he [applicant] must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. at 688. This Court has stated that applicants seeking postconviction relief due to ineffective assistance of counsel are “saddled with a ‘heavy burden,’ in that there exists ‘a strong presumption [recognized by this Court] that an attorney’s performance falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound strategy * * *.’” Rice, 38 A.3d at 17 (quoting Ouimette v. State, 785 A.2d 1132, 1138-39 (R.I. 2001)).', 'On appeal, Bell argues that counsel gave him “inaccurate advice” by telling him he had a “clear-cut” case of defense of another and that he “would not serve jail time.” The applicant asserts that, because of that advice, he did not have the opportunity to entertain a favorable plea agreement.', 'Bell does not appear to argue that counsel’s trial performance amounted to', '-5- ineffective assistance but, rather, that counsel’s understatement of the risks involved in going to trial prevented him from making an informed decision at the outset to avoid trial by entering a plea agreement. 4', 'Bell argues that his decision to go to trial was based on “incorrect advice”; however, at his postconviction-relief hearing he admitted that, from the beginning, he did not want to “take any offer” because he wanted to join the military. 5 Attorney Dwyer testified that his client wanted to go “to trial because he wanted to go into the military, he wanted to clear his name, and he felt that his actions were justified under the circumstances, and I agreed with him.”', 'Unlike the cases upon which applicant relies, in which either a plea offer was not conveyed to the defendant, or its merits were not adequately discussed, in this case, there is no evidence that any plea arrangement was even offered. See, e.g., Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399, 1404 (2012); Commonwealth v. Napper, 385 A.2d 521, 524 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1978). On the contrary, counsel testified that he did not actively pursue a plea disposition “because [he] was told in no uncertain terms [that they were] going to trial, so [he] remember[ed] being in chambers * * * and [he] remember[ed] saying something to the effect that, ‘Let’s not even talk about a plea deal because he’s not taking a deal. He wants to go to trial.’”', 'Pursuant to Article V, Rule 1.2(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct, “[i]n a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.” Counsel unquestionably abided by his client’s decision in this case, and Bell now argues that 4', 'The recent United States Supreme Court opinion in Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376, 1384 (2012), reiterated that criminal defendants are entitled to competent counsel during plea negotiations. 5', 'Apparently, defendant was concerned that a felony conviction would render him ineligible for military service.', '-6- counsel underestimated the chance that he would be found guilty at trial and failed to advise him of the possible sentence he would face if convicted. Therefore, Bell asserts that his decision to go to trial was not an informed one.', 'Bell testified that he had met with counsel in person approximately twelve times, in addition to having contact with him by telephone and email.', 'Bell admitted during his postconviction-relief hearing that counsel had explained to him the affirmative defenses of self- defense and defense of others, but he denied that counsel had ever advised him that, if he were to be found guilty, it was possible he could receive a jail sentence. However, Bell did admit that, when he went to trial, he knew that he could go to jail. Attorney Dwyer testified that, while he did not have a specific recollection of a particular conversation with Bell, it was his regular practice to “tell [clients] the upside [and] the downside[:] * * * the downside is there’s always a possibility of going to jail to the maximum * * *.”', 'The applicant testified that, prior to trial, he would not have accepted a plea to a felony, even if it did not involve a jail term, explaining that, because he “really wanted to go in the Army, [he] didn’t want to take a felony charge.” Not only was there never such an offer, but the hearing justice recalled that, “[i]n the pre-trial chambers conference, it was clear that a plea to a non-jail disposition would not be offered and that the [c]ourt would not accept one, in any event, because Benchmark 10 assigns a four to five year sentence to the offense of felony assault.”', '“[A] choice between trial tactics, which appears unwise only in hindsight, does not constitute constitutionally-deficient representation under the reasonably competent assistance standard.” State v. D’Alo, 477 A.2d 89, 92 (R.I. 1984) (quoting United States v. Bosch, 584 F.2d 1113, 1121 (1st Cir. 1978)). “To state and prove a claim under this standard, [an applicant] must allege and demonstrate that his counsel’s error clearly ‘resulted from neglect or ignorance rather', '-7- than from informed, professional deliberation.’” Id. (quoting Bosch, 584 F.2d at 1121). Here, Bell admitted that he thought counsel “did a good job” before he was convicted. It was only after trial that Bell’s opinion of counsel changed, at which point he decided “[counsel] didn’t do a good job at the end.” When asked at his postconviction hearing whether “this whole thing is about the fact that you don’t like the outcome of [the trial],” Bell responded “[y]eah, I guess.”', 'It may well be true that, had Bell known that he would be convicted and sentenced to a fifteen-year term with four years to serve, he may have put aside his hopes for a military career in favor of pursuing a shorter prison term. However, effective assistance of counsel does not involve the ability to accurately predict the future. It is sufficient that counsel informed Bell of his options and then abided by his client’s choice to go to trial. Although he now concedes that the use of deadly force was unjustified, according to counsel, at the time of trial, Bell believed he had been defending others and himself. Counsel pursued the affirmative defenses based on what the trial justice characterized as “a sincere and reasonable belief * * * that Bell had a viable self/third party defense * * *.” We can discern no error in the trial justice’s determination that Dwyer provided “capable, competent and intelligent advocacy” to applicant.', 'B', 'Prejudice', '“Prejudice exists if there is a reasonable probability that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Larngar v. Wall, 918 A.2d 850, 856 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)). Although we have found that the first prong of Strickland has not been met, we note that, in any case, the applicant cannot meet this second prong of Strickland because he cannot show that any plea offer was forthcoming, much less that he would have accepted it, given his stated desire to avoid a', '-8- felony conviction in order to join the military. To prove prejudice, the applicant would need to pile supposition upon supposition: (1) that, had counsel sought to open plea negotiations, the state would make a favorable offer; (2) that the applicant would have accepted an offer that, of necessity, would have required him to plead guilty to a felony, thus presumably preventing him from joining the military; (3) that the offer would have been approved by the court; and (4) that the offer would have resulted in a shorter prison term than the four years the applicant is presently serving. Postconviction relief cannot rest on such a tenuous basis. In short, the applicant could not prove that he was prejudiced in any way by counsel’s performance.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

27,State : v. : Alfred Bishop.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal from a judgment of conviction adjudicating the defendant Alfred Bishop guilty of (1) first-degree murder, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1; (2) burglary, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; (3) three counts of using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2; and (4) two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. In May 2009, he was sentenced to life without parole on the murder conviction, and he was sentenced to significant further incarceration on the other counts. Bishop filed a motion for new trial, but the motion was denied by the trial justice. Bishop now appeals from the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial justice erred in refusing to admit evidence about the alleged intoxication and drug possession of certain witnesses for the state and in allowing what he contends was extremely prejudicial information about Bishop’s parole status into evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background', '1', 'Underlying Home Invasion', 'The dramatic and ultimately fatal series of events giving rise to the charges against Bishop began to unfold on June 27, 2007. Ceasar and Claire Medeiros, husband and wife, lived in Warwick with Ceasar’s brother, Gabriel, and a pet dog. 1 On the night of June 27, 2007, at around midnight, Ceasar and Claire were awakened by the sound of their dog barking. Ceasar said he got out of bed to investigate, while Claire remained in bed. He went out to the darkened hallway and saw a masked figure holding a shiny object in his hand. Ceasar pleaded with the intruder to not hurt his family and told the intruder that there was money and jewelry in the bedroom. Ceasar returned to the bedroom, and, when he noticed that the intruder had not followed him, he grabbed a golf club and went back to the hallway, where he proceeded to clobber the intruder with a blow to the head—a blow so strong that the head of the golf club separated from the shaft. Ceasar continued to strike the intruder with the shaft of the golf club, and he also began to kick him. During the ensuring fierce struggle, a firearm discharged.', 'Claire testified that she came out of the bedroom and turned on the hallway light for a few seconds so that she could see what was going on. By this time, and as a result of the confrontation with Ceasar, the intruder’s ski mask had become partially dislodged. Both Claire and Ceasar later testified that they were able to view the intruder’s face. Claire turned off the 1', 'Throughout this decision, we refer to some individuals by their first name. This is for the purpose of clarity only, and we intend no disrespect.', '-2- hallway light, ran to a spare bedroom to get a phone, went back to her bedroom, and called the 9- 1-1 emergency system for help.', 'According to Ceasar, the intruder then retreated into the kitchen, which, by this time, had been illuminated by Gabriel, who had arrived from his basement bedroom to investigate the disturbance. Ceasar followed the intruder and observed Gabriel and the intruder engage in a deadly struggle. There was a shot, after which Gabriel and the intruder both fell to the kitchen floor, and then there was another shot. Ceasar began to use the end of the golf club shaft to stab the intruder but fell down during the scuffle. The intruder was able to break away, escaping through a sliding glass door in the dining area and disappearing into the night. Before the intruder fled, Ceasar was able to look at the intruder’s face once again, because, by this time, the ski mask had been completely removed. Ceasar next remembered his wife coming into the kitchen and emergency personnel arriving on the scene.', 'Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel were rushed to the emergency room at Rhode Island Hospital. Claire had incurred a minor gunshot wound in her upper leg, and Ceasar had suffered one gunshot wound to his arm and another to his leg. Gabriel, however, was pronounced dead as a result of a gunshot wound to the torso shortly after he was brought to Rhode Island Hospital.', 'When Claire and Ceasar arrived at the emergency room, they were met by police officers who attempted to obtain descriptions of the intruder from them. Claire described the intruder as a white male with slicked-back, gray hair, who looked over the age of forty. She also described him as four inches taller than her husband, who was about five-feet and seven-inches tall. She believed that the man was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt.', 'Ceasar’s description was similar—he said that the intruder was a man with “wrinkles,” “beady eyes,” a receding hairline, and “slicked back hair” that was either red in color or possibly gray in color with blood matted', '-3- into it. A laboratory report from the hospital, which was later admitted into evidence, indicated that Ceasar’s blood alcohol content was 0.134 shortly after he was first seen at the emergency room.', 'Shortly thereafter, a retired Warwick Police Captain Linda I. Eastman, who was a sketch artist, created a composite sketch based on Claire’s description of the intruder. The sketch was then shown to Ceasar, who suggested that the intruder had more of a receding hairline than was depicted in the first sketch; Claire agreed. The composite sketch was then distributed within the Rhode Island law-enforcement community, resulting in a tentative identification of Bishop as the intruder.', 'Warwick Police Det. Sgt. Robert Bentsen, who was the lead investigator in the case, was advised that the sketch resembled Bishop. On July 1, 2007, Det. Sgt. Bentsen attempted to visit Bishop at his last known address, and when nobody answered the door, Det. Sgt. Bentsen visited another location where he believed Bishop might be visiting—the home of Bishop’s sister and her husband—to no avail. However, Bishop’s brother-in-law called another location where he believed Bishop was living and left a message for Bishop to call Det. Sgt. Bentsen. Later that afternoon, Bishop returned Det. Sgt. Bentsen’s telephone call. In that conversation, Bishop indicated that he wanted to talk about the June 27, 2007 incident, but said that he could not because he had sustained some minor injuries over his left eye—explaining that he had hurt himself at his place of employment. The telephone call ended before any arrangement could be made for the detective to interview Bishop. On July 2, 2007, Det. Sgt. Bentsen then contacted Bishop’s parole officer, Matthew Degnan, who informed him that Bishop had failed to report to him that day, as required by the conditions of his parole. Degnan indicated that he obtained a parole-detention warrant for Bishop because he had failed to attend the scheduled meeting—a', '-4- violation of his parole—and also because he had tested positive for alcohol at an earlier meeting—yet another parole violation.', 'In addition, Warwick Police Det. Barbara Frazier, who worked in the Bureau of Criminal Identification, obtained a warrant authorizing the search of the home of Reine Bishop, Bishop’s ex-wife. Parole logs, in which Bishop was required to memorialize everywhere he went and the persons with whom he was with, were seized from a dresser located in Reine’s bedroom. One of those logs, dated June 27, 2007, reflected the notation: “stayed overnight at Reine’s mothers.” However, another parole log for the same day indicated that Bishop had left Reine’s home shortly before midnight. No satisfactory explanation for that discrepancy ever was offered.', 'Eventually, by tracing a telephone call, Det. Sgt. Bentsen was able to locate Bishop. On July 3, 2007, Bishop was taken into custody without incident. At police headquarters, Bishop’s photograph was taken, and hair samples and DNA samples were obtained.', 'That same afternoon, Ceasar and Claire were asked to report to police headquarters for additional questioning; they were not told specifically what the questions would involve. In fact, Det. Frazier had compiled a photo array. The photo array was shown to Claire and Ceasar, independently of each other, and both identified Bishop as the intruder. 2', '2', 'Forensic Evidence Development', 'After the crime scene was secured, detectives began to develop forensic evidence. Physical evidence—including the ski mask, several bullet casings, a seat cover of a chair from the deck, and the shaft and head of the golf club—was retrieved from the scene, and numerous photographs were taken. Blood samples were also collected from some of the physical evidence, 2', 'Before trial, the trial justice determined that the method employed by the police for this identification procedure was proper. Bishop does not challenge that ruling on appeal.', '-5- as well as from a number of areas within and around the home, including the hallway, kitchen, dining area, and the sliding glass door. The samples were submitted to the Rhode Island Department of Health for DNA analysis, where it was determined that certain samples that were tested—the ski mask, the kitchen and dining room, the seat cover, a portion of one of the venetian blinds, and the golf club head—matched Bishop’s DNA.', 'Further, a forensic examination was conducted on hair that was found inside the ski mask. This also matched a hair sample retrieved from Bishop when he was taken into custody.', 'In addition, although there was no evidence of a forced entry at the Medeiroses’ home, the photographs from the kitchen portrayed a violent struggle, as emphasized by large quantities of blood on the floor, the walls, and the venetian blinds. There was also a trail of blood leading from the sliding glass door that was near the dining area, which allowed the detectives to track the route of the intruder’s escape. Indeed, the blood trail indicated that the intruder exited the house onto the deck, cut through the backyard, passed some foliage and a fence on the side of the house, and then traveled across the street into a parking lot of a school administration building. That parking lot was near Reine’s home.', 'B', 'Pretrial Motions', 'On February 6, 2008, an indictment was returned against Bishop.', 'Before the trial commenced, the state had filed various motions in limine, three of which underlie the issues now before us on appeal. One of the motions filed by the state was “to prohibit evidence of the presence of alcohol or controlled substances in the blood of [Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel],” and', '-6- another was “to prohibit evidence of the fact that marijuana and Inositol[3] were found in the bedroom of Gabriel.” The trial justice did not formally rule on these motions after they were argued. However, evidence of Ceasar’s alcohol consumption was later admitted at trial, but evidence of Ceasar, Claire, or Gabriel’s alleged use or possession of controlled substances was excluded. Indeed, during the trial, when defense counsel attempted to cross-examine Ceasar and Claire about their alleged drug use on the evening in question, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection, ruling that defense counsel had failed to proffer any evidence that the use of drugs had affected the memory or conduct of the witnesses. Similarly, when defense counsel sought to cross-examine Warwick Police Det. Daniel Gillis of the Bureau of Criminal Identification about the marijuana and cutting agent found in Gabriel’s bedroom, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection to the admission of such evidence because defense counsel had not established its probative value.', 'The other relevant motion was the state’s motion to allow the introduction of the following evidence:', '“1. That [d]efendant was incarcerated at the [Adult Correctional', 'Institutions (ACI)] before August, 2006;', '“2. That [d]efendant had been on parole since August, 2006 and', 'remained on parole until July 3, 2007;', '“3. That [d]efendant had a parole officer from August, 2006', 'through July 3, 2007 * * * whom he reported to;', '“4. That [d]efendant failed to appear for a required meeting with', 'his parole officer on July 2, 2007;', '“5. That [d]efendant, as a condition of parole, maintained a log of', 'his daily travels;', '“6. That a [w]arrant for a [v]iolation of his parole was issued on', 'July 2, 2007 and executed on July 3, 2007.” 3', 'Inositol is a common “cutting agent,” which is a substance used to increase the volume of a quantity of a controlled substance.', '-7- Conversely, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to prohibit direct or indirect references by the state and its witnesses to various evidence, including, as relevant to this appeal, “[a]ny testimony of the prior record of the defendant,” “[a]ny testimony or reference to defendant’s parole status,” and “[a]ny testimony or reference to defendant’s parole ‘log,’ or introduction of said log.” When he ruled on these motions, the trial justice excluded any reference to Bishop’s incarceration, but he did allow limited evidence concerning Bishop’s parole status at the time of the incident in question. The trial justice based his decision on a finding that “under the circumstances * * * the parole status of [Bishop] d[id] not substantially outweigh its probative value due to the fact that it is something that’s intertwined through the testimony of a number of witnesses and * * * [Bishop]’s statement [to the police] on July 3.”', 'After the hearing on the motions in limine, a trial before a jury commenced, beginning on February 23, 2009 and ending on March 4, 2009. During the trial, testimony was presented from twenty-one witnesses for the state, including Ceasar and Claire, who testified about the home invasion that occurred on June 27, 2007, and many of the police detectives involved in the investigation and development of the evidence against Bishop. In addition, Kenneth Turchetta, an acquaintance of Bishop’s, testified that he received telephone calls from Reine early on the morning of June 28, 2007. He said that he recognized Bishop’s voice in the background, and he remembered Reine saying that they needed a doctor.', 'Similarly, Daniel Antonelli, who had employed Bishop as a woodworker for about six months starting in August 2006, recalled that Bishop stopped by on June 28, 2007 and asked Antonelli to provide him with a false alibi—that Bishop had been injured while working at Antonelli’s shop and that the injury was caused by some pipe staging. Antonelli initially agreed to go along with the alibi suggestion, but within a day or two, he changed his mind and informed Bishop that he would not lie on Bishop’s behalf.', '-8-', 'Finally, Bishop took the stand and offered a version of the facts that was strikingly different from the description that had been provided by Ceasar and Claire. Bishop did not deny that he was inside the home of Ceasar and Claire on the night in question. However, he explained that he had been at Reine’s house, and, at some point during the night, he saw a shadow pass by the bedroom window. He said he went outside to investigate, but he did not discover any intruder. He claimed that he sat on the front stairs, at which point he heard someone call out his name. He realized that the person who was calling his name was in front of Ceasar and Claire’s driveway. Bishop walked towards the person, who said, “my brother wants to talk to you,” and led Bishop inside the home. Bishop testified that he entered the house, and the door was immediately shut behind him. According to his testimony, he immediately found himself surrounded by three men. One of the men put a gun to Bishop’s ear, while another placed a ski mask over his head and remarked, “he’s looking like a burglar now.” The third man retrieved a golf club and began to strike Bishop with it. Bishop said a gun went off before the first blow from the golf club, but that he was not wounded. The men moved Bishop to the kitchen, where more shots were fired, and Bishop found himself on the floor, struggling with the man who possessed the gun.', 'Bishop explained that he attempted to escape through a sliding glass door, but on an adjacent deck, he saw the man with the gun. The man attempted to shoot him, but the gun merely clicked and the man ran off across the yard. Bishop tried to follow him, but he heard police sirens and retreated, first across the street next to Reine’s house and then to a friend’s house. He claimed that he bandaged his head and called Reine to pick him up.', '-9-', 'The jury found Bishop guilty as to all counts submitted to it.4 Bishop filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied on April 28, 2009.', 'He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, two additional life sentences—one to run consecutive to the first and the other to run concurrent—and four consecutive twenty-year sentences. Bishop filed a timely notice of appeal on May 22, 2009, challenging the trial justice’s decision to exclude any evidence of drug use by Ceasar or Claire, to exclude any evidence of drug possession by Gabriel, and to admit evidence of Bishop’s parole status.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We have long held, and in this jurisdiction it is beyond peradventure, that “decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1216 (R.I. 1995)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Consumption of Intoxicants', 'Bishop argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he disallowed evidence that Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel had either taken or possessed drugs on the evening of the incident and, thus, violated his constitutional right to cross-examination. Bishop maintains that there was evidence of “heavy alcohol and drug use by those living in the home” and that that supports a finding of intoxication.', 'It is well recognized that proof that a witness consumed intoxicating substances at or around the time of the event that he or she is testifying about is relevant to impeach a witness’s ability to perceive an event, to remember the facts, and to accurately relate those facts at trial. See Avarista v. Aloisio, 672 A.2d 887, 891 (R.I. 1996) (explaining that evidence of intoxication is permissible “to test the witnesses’ accuracy, memory, veracity, or credibility” citing State v. Crowhurst, 470 A.2d 1138, 1143 (R.I. 1984)); O’Brien v. Waterman, 91 R.I. 374, 381, 163 A.2d 31, 35 (1960). This alone, however, is not enough. Contrary to Bishop’s argument—that evidence of the influence of drugs is never excludable on relevance grounds because credibility is always relevant—the admissibility of evidence regarding consumption of intoxicating substances is not completely unfettered: “neither party may question a witness merely to show', '- 11 - that he or she may have consumed some potentially intoxicating substance before an event at issue in the case has occurred” in an attempt to affect credibility. State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137, 148-49 (R.I. 2000) (citing State v. Amaral, 109 R.I. 379, 386, 285 A.2d 783, 787 (1972)).', 'Bishop improperly conflates the holding that evidence of intoxication is “never excludable on relevance grounds” with the proposition that such evidence is always admissible. State v. Squillante, 622 A.2d 474, 481 (R.I. 1993). This is an incorrect reading of the rules of evidence and does not comport with our longstanding interpretation thereof. Indeed, under Rule 403, relevant evidence can be excluded if its “probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” It is because of the undue potential to cause confusion and unfair prejudice in admitting evidence of intoxication that we established a “gatekeeping procedure” in Handy v. Geary, 105 R.I. 419, 431, 252 A.2d 435, 441 (1969), to determine whether evidence of this kind is admissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness. Clark, 974 A.2d at 582-83 (citing Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42); Avarista, 672 A.2d at 891.', 'Indeed, “[o]nly when [evidence of the consumption of intoxicants] is offered for the purpose of proving ‘intoxication,’ as that term is defined in Handy,[5] is such evidence admissible.” Rice, 755 A.2d at 149.', 'Specifically, under the Handy procedure, before evidence of the consumption of intoxicants may be introduced into evidence, “the trial justice shall conduct a preliminary 5', 'In Handy v. Geary, 105 R.I. 419, 431, 252 A.2d 435, 441 (1969), this Court defined “intoxication” as', '“a situation where, by reason of drinking intoxicants an individual', 'does not have the normal use of his physical or mental faculties,', 'thus rendering him incapable of acting in a manner in which an', 'ordinarily prudent and cautious man, in full possession of his', 'faculties, using reasonable care, would act under like conditions.”', '- 12 - evidentiary hearing on th[e] issue in the absence of the jury” to resolve whether evidence of consumption rises to such a level that it should be admitted at trial. Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42; see Clark, 974 A.2d at 583. Only if the trial justice finds “that the evidence is such that different minds can naturally and fairly come to different conclusions on the question of intoxication, * * * then and only then, may evidence of [consumption of intoxicants] be admitted under proper instruction” given to the jury. Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 442. Accordingly, as a predicate to the admission of evidence of intoxication, the trial justice must be satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the witness was, in fact, intoxicated.', 'In Amaral, 109 R.I. at 387, 285 A.2d at 787-88, we extended the application of the Handy procedure to criminal cases. See also State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 790 (R.I. 2011); State v. Mattatall, 114 R.I. 568, 572, 337 A.2d 229, 232 (1975). We have also applied this test equally to admitting evidence of drug use and other intoxicants. See State v. Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d 1070, 1088 (R.I. 1981) (applying Handy to marijuana); Mattatall, 114 R.I. at 572, 337 A.2d at 232 (applying Handy to narcotics, as well as alcohol). 6', 'With regard to Ceasar, Bishop argues that there was ample evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, which, he argues, was critical to the jury’s assessment of whether Ceasar had accurately perceived and could accurately recount the events of June 27, 2007. Specifically, Bishop points to the laboratory report that indicated traces of cocaine and marijuana in Ceasar’s bloodstream 6', 'We recognize that some cases from this Court have not raised or mentioned the Handy procedure as the prerequisite in evaluating the admissibility of intoxicating substances for the purpose of impeachment, see, e.g., State v. Lemos, 743 A.2d 558, 563 (R.I. 2000); State v. Squillante, 622 A.2d 474, 481 (R.I. 1993); State v. Kelly, 554 A.2d 632, 637 (R.I. 1989); State v. Carrera, 528 A.2d 331, 333 (R.I. 1987); however, we clarified in State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137, 149 (R.I. 2000), and reaffirmed in State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 583 n.24 (R.I. 2009), that Handy and its progeny establish the procedure for determining the admissibility of this evidence.', '- 13 - and a blood alcohol content of 0.134, Ceasar’s testimony that he consumed four cocktails, his imperfect description of the intruder to the police, and his statement to a detective that “everyone drank and smoked marijuana” on the night of the incident. However, based on our review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in limiting the cross-examination about Ceasar’s alleged drug use.', 'Indeed, before limiting the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, the trial justice carefully reviewed the challenged evidence. See Clark, 974 A.2d at 564 (emphasizing that a trial justice should “cautiously exercise his or her discretion, ever mindful of the potential for prejudicial error,” when the state seeks to limit or exclude evidence in a criminal case). When he considered the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, the trial justice determined that defense counsel had not come forward with any evidence about whether the trace amount of cocaine or any other illicit substance that was found in Ceasar’s blood would have affected his memory, conduct, or ability to perceive the events that were occurring on the night in question. Id. 582-83 (Handy standard not met when an individual had been drinking but no proof was presented as to a lack of physical and mental faculties).', 'Although defense counsel emphasizes the laboratory report, which indicated trace amounts of cocaine, opiates, and cannabinoids in Ceasar’s system, 7 the trial justice concluded that there was nothing of evidentiary value that would quantify the amount of 7', 'The report indicated “POS NC*,” or “positive not confirmed,” as to the presence of opiates, cocaine, and cannabinoids. The asterisk is keyed on the report to mean “Critical/Abnormal” and “Abnormal.” Further, a footnote was provided next to opiates, supplementing that', '“[a]ll drug of abuse * * * immunoassays are performed on urine', 'samples unless otherwise noted. Results are from screening', 'methods. * * * Positive results of screening tests are not', 'confirmed and are reported as ‘POS NC’ (positive not confirmed).', 'Confirmed drugs of abuse are reported as positive. If confirmatory', 'testing is desired, it MUST BE REQUESTED as a separate order', 'to the Toxicology Lab WITHIN 5 DAYS OF SAMPLE', 'COLLECTION. Unconfirmed screening result should only be', 'used for medical purposes.”', '- 14 - cocaine that may have been in Ceasar’s system at the time of the incident, nothing to show how long the drug may have been in his system, and nothing of evidentiary value to demonstrate that any cocaine in Ceasar’s system was sufficient to affect his ability to perceive the events. Indeed, the trial justice noted that defense counsel', '“advised the [c]ourt * * * that he d[id] not have an expert to testify', 'whether or not the amount of cocaine [wa]s significant, whether it', 'would affect Ceasar Medeiros’s memory or his conduct on the', 'evening in question, nor [wa]s there a proffer as to what the expert', 'would testify to concerning the issue of how long cocaine and its', 'various forms might stay in the human body * * *.” Based on this lack of proof, the trial justice held that the evidence contained in the laboratory report did not rise to the level where different minds could come to different conclusions as to whether Ceasar was intoxicated, and, therefore, he excluded the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use. See Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42. “This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination absent an abuse of discretion,” and we perceive the existence of no such abuse here. Clark, 974 A.2d at 583. Accordingly, we hold that there was no error in the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence of Ceasar’s use of drugs.', 'Even less evidence was presented by Bishop with regard to Claire and Gabriel’s alleged intoxication. The evidence Bishop’s trial counsel was prepared to offer about Claire was a statement made by Ceasar to Det. DiGregorio that “everyone drank and smoked marijuana” on the night of the incident. Defense counsel argued to the trial justice that smoking marijuana was relevant to “set[] the tone of what was going on in the house before the defendant supposedly entered, and * * * [to explain] what state of mind [Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel] were in before the defendant came in.” However, the trial justice quite correctly found that this offer of proof was insufficient under Handy, Amaral, and Rice, because defense counsel had not come forward with', '- 15 - any evidence “that either the ingestion of illicit drugs, marijuana, or alcohol arose to the level of intoxication.”', 'In a similar vein, defense counsel argued that the existence of marijuana and a cutting agent found in Gabriel’s bedroom should be presented as “part of the climate of what was going on in th[e] house.” The trial justice sustained the state’s objection to this line of inquiry because defense counsel failed to establish the probative value of this evidence. We agree with the trial justice and, accordingly, hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in limiting the cross-examination of Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel’s alleged drug use and possession.', 'We pause to note that, in our opinion, the trial justice was more than fair when he allowed testimony about Ceasar’s alcohol intake. The jury was well aware of Ceasar’s potential credibility issues with regard to his capacity to recount the events at issue, which had been significantly called into question by his own testimony that he had consumed “a couple of cocktails” when he went out to lunch with his sister-in-law on June 27, 2007. Further, when pressed on cross-examination, he stated that he actually imbibed somewhere around four cocktails at lunch and drank still more when friends stopped by the house earlier that evening. In addition, before it retired to deliberate, the jury was provided with a copy of the hospital laboratory report. Although the references to any illegal substances had been redacted, the report nonetheless indicated that Ceasar’s blood alcohol content was 0.134. Accordingly, because the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he found that the evidence of drug use and possession was inadmissible under Handy and its progeny, and given the fact that defense counsel was provided with a reasonable opportunity to impeach Ceasar about his alcohol usage,', '- 16 - we hold that the trial justice did not violate Bishop’s confrontation rights by limiting defense counsel’s cross-examination with respect to the use of or possession of any drugs. 8', 'Bishop claims, however, that the trial justice erred by requiring expert testimony to prove that consumption reached a level of intoxication. This, he argues, was an error of law because there is no obligation, as a condition precedent to admitting intoxication evidence, for the production of an expert to prove the effect of the substance.', 'We disagree with Bishop’s characterization that the trial justice obligated them to produce expert testimony. 9', 'A close look at the record reveals that the trial justice did not limit the cross-examination because he believed that, as a matter of law, Bishop needed an expert to testify to the intoxicating effects of ingesting cocaine and other illicit substances. Even though he noted that there was an absence of expert testimony, the trial justice was simply considering the evidence before him in deciding whether Bishop had produced the quantum of evidence sufficient to allow evidence of intoxication to come before the jury—a fact-intensive analysis. Indeed, the veteran trial justice concluded that the inference suggested by Bishop—that, based on the presence of cocaine in Ceasar’s bloodstream, the jury could infer that Ceasar was intoxicated—was far too conjectural and speculative to meet the Handy standard.', 'See Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d at 1088 (cross-examination properly limited when the defendant failed to offer an evidentiary basis for 8', 'Similarly, Bishop argues that evidence of Ceasar’s drug use would have been relevant to support the defense’s theory that Bishop had been coaxed into the house by several men, including Ceasar, because evidence of drug use would have made it more likely that Ceasar was disinhibited and in a state to engage in aggressive behavior. However, in accordance with our discussion above, the trial justice properly excluded evidence of Ceasar’s use of drugs because defense counsel failed to offer evidence of intoxication. 9', 'We note that both parties have cited a number of cases from other jurisdictions to advocate for their respective positions as to whether expert testimony should be required before allowing evidence of the consumption of intoxicating substances. However, we decline to adopt a per se rule in this area, as this is a decision left to the sound discretion of the trial justices. State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009).', '- 17 - his allegation that a witness was intoxicated). The trial justice explained that he had “reviewed the drug treatment of at least hundreds, if not thousands of defendants over the years” and was “aware that some illicit drugs * * * may remain in the human body and its bloodstream for days, even weeks after consumption.” Without an evidentiary link between the presence of illicit substances in Ceasar’s blood and the effect of such substances on his cognitive abilities, the laboratory report had little value and fell far short of meeting the standard of intoxication set forth in Handy. See Mattatall, 114 R.I. at 573, 337 A.2d at 233 (attempting to infer that an individual was intoxicated based on the presence of alcohol and narcotics in his system was “far too tenuous” to meet the Handy standard and, therefore, was properly excluded).', 'Finally, Bishop contends that the trial justice erred as a matter of law because he did not follow the procedure outlined in Handy. We find this argument to be somewhat disingenuous; Bishop—the party who was attempting to introduce evidence of intoxication—never requested a Handy hearing in the first place. Nevertheless, we note that, even if the trial justice did not precisely follow the voir dire procedures outlined in Handy, the conferences that the trial justice did conduct on the record indicate that he “act[ed] within the spirit” of Handy and its progeny. State v. Carvalho, 892 A.2d 140, 147-48 (R.I. 2006) (A hearing on defendant’s motion in limine regarding possible intoxication “indicate[d] that the trial justice * * * act[ed] within the spirit of our decisions in the Handy line of cases.”). Specifically, the trial justice conducted a hearing on the state’s motions in limine and held sidebar conferences when the state objected to defense counsel’s cross-examination on drug use and possession. During the conferences conducted on the record, the trial justice considered the arguments articulated for and against the admissibility of the evidence of the witnesses’ possible intoxication, carefully weighed the proffered evidence,', '- 18 - and ultimately ruled that the evidence was inadmissible because it did not rise “to the level of intoxication.” We hold this to be sufficient. See id. 147-48. 10', 'B', 'Admission of Parole Status', 'Bishop also argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing testimony about Bishop’s parole status. Bishop maintains that this evidence should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because any probative value it may have had was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial wallop. Specifically, Bishop challenges: (1) Det. Sgt. Bentsen’s testimonial references that Degnan was Bishop’s parole officer and that Bishop was arrested on a parole-detention warrant; (2) Degnan’s testimony that Bishop tested positive for alcohol at his last meeting, in violation of the conditions of his parole, and that Bishop failed to report to Degnan on the Monday following the murder; (3) testimony that Bishop was required to catalog his every location and associates; and (4) references to the fact that Bishop’s DNA was taken at the ACI. Bishop maintains that those references to his parole status were immaterial, redactable, superfluous, and unduly prejudicial. We disagree.', 'Before admitting otherwise probative evidence, a trial justice must carefully consider the relevance of the evidence relative to its potential prejudicial effect, pursuant to Rule 403. Rule 403 provides that, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading 10', 'Bishop also argues that the trial justice erred by excluding this evidence on relevancy grounds. Although the trial justice did say that he was excluding the evidence on relevancy grounds, after a review of the record, we are convinced that the trial justice came to the conclusion that the Handy standard was not satisfied, even if he did not precisely articulate it. Accordingly, we are not confronted with a case in which the trial justice has excluded intoxication evidence on relevancy grounds alone. See Carrera, 528 A.2d at 334 (“[I]t would be error for the trial justice to prohibit this line of questioning [regarding a witness’s drug use at the time of an incident at issue] on relevance grounds alone.”).', '- 19 - the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” This Court has said that “a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly”; only when such evidence demonstrate mere marginal relevance and enormous unfair prejudice should the trial justice exclude it. State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008).', 'After a carefully measured and thoughtful analysis, we are of the firm opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in permitting the references to Bishop’s parole status. In considering the motions in limine, the trial justice explained that evidence of Bishop’s parole status was “highly relevant” and “needed by the state to prove its case.” Specifically, he explained that the evidence regarding Bishop’s parole status was relevant to explain Bishop’s “opportunity,” including “his whereabouts at the time of the crimes,” as well as “his knowledge, identity, and intent” regarding June 27, 2007. Indeed, the evidence regarding Bishop’s parole status was relevant to explain how the police detectives identified him as a suspect.', 'For example, the discrepancies in Bishop’s travel logs for the night of the home invasion were probative, not only of his whereabouts at the time, but also of his opportunity to commit the crimes and his attempts to cover his tracks in the aftermath of his criminal activity. Also, Bishop’s uncharacteristic failure to report to his parole officer as scheduled, approximately five days after the murder, was certainly probative of his consciousness of guilt. Thus, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in concluding that evidence of Bishop’s parole status was highly relevant and probative to show Bishop’s opportunity, knowledge, identity, and intent regarding the June 27, 2007, incident. See State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (“It is within the sound discretion of the trial justice whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule 403.” quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2005)).', '- 20 -', 'Further, the trial justice was careful to mitigate any prejudicial impact that evidence of Bishop’s status as a parolee might have had. The trial justice ordered that Bishop’s “parole status w[ould] only be admitted for limited purposes, such as proving opportunity, knowledge, identity, and intent regarding the June 27-28, 2007 incident,” and he instructed the jury as to that. Additionally, in assessing potential prejudice, the trial justice determined that Bishop’s parole status was factually connected to the crimes charged, and was so intertwined with the facts that it became part and parcel of the entire case, such that the probative value substantially outweighed the danger of prejudicial harm.', 'See State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1191 (R.I. 1988) (probative value substantially outweighed undue prejudice when the use of drugs at issue was factually connected to the crimes charged and “so intertwined with the facts that it became part and parcel of the entire case”). Specifically, the trial justice considered the state’s proffer— based on “the discovery materials including the grand jury presentation”—that (1) Bishop “was arrested on a parole warrant”; (2) Bishop “gave a statement to the police on” the day he was arrested, in which he made “several references to his parole status and the parole logs”; (3) Bishop’s parole logs, which were seized at Reine’s house pursuant to a warrant, reflected that Bishop left Reine’s house less than two hours before the incident in question; (4) Bishop did not report to his parole officer on the Monday after the incident, and there was “substantial evidence that the reason [he] failed to report [wa]s because he suffered a serious injury to his head”; (5) Turchetta was to testify that Reine called him on the morning after the murder to ask him for a doctor, explaining that Bishop “c[ould not] go to [just any doctor] because of his probation [sic]”; and (6) Antonelli, who hired Bishop as a condition of his parole, was to testify that “shortly after the murder, [Bishop] asked him to falsely confirm that Bishop had been injured', '- 21 - while at work.” 11 See DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883 (explaining that evidence is not to be excluded under Rule 403 unless it “is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial”). Based on this, the trial justice concluded that the evidence of Bishop’s parole status was relevant, and the probative value was not substantially outweighed by its potential undue prejudice.', 'Moreover—and although we conclude that the prejudicial effect of this evidence was minimal—we recognize that in addition to carefully weighing the risk of unfair prejudice, the trial justice, in a pretrial order, provided “adequate safety measures * * * to protect defendant” from undue prejudice. See Woodson, 551 A.2d at 1193. For one, he barred the introduction of the circumstances of Bishop’s previous incarceration. Indeed, although the trial justice allowed testimony that Bishop had been previously convicted of a felony, he limited testimony regarding the character of the crime, which was first-degree murder. Further, the trial justice “ordered that the state instruct all of its witnesses that they will not testify to [Bishop]’s incarceration, detention, residence in prison or jail, nor the offenses for which he ha[d] served prison time.” The trial justice was also careful to restrict any reference that it was individuals at the ACI who recognized the composite sketch to be Bishop.', 'The trial justice further safeguarded against the risk of unfair prejudice by issuing an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury about the very limited purpose for which the evidence concerning Bishop’s parole was offered. Specifically, the trial justice instructed that the evidence could not be used to support a conclusion that Bishop was of bad character and, thus, may have committed the offenses for which he was on trial; the evidence could be used 11', 'Ultimately, Bishop’s police statement was never admitted into evidence, and while both Antonelli and Turchetta testified at Bishop’s trial, Antonelli never testified that he hired Bishop as a condition of his parole and Turchetta never testified that Reine told him that Bishop “c[ould not] go to [just any doctor] because of his probation [sic],” although he did testify that Reine called him to seek medical assistance for Bishop.', '- 22 - only for limited purposes, such as proving opportunity—for example, his whereabouts at the time of the crimes at issue to which the parole logs speak—or to explain his opportunity, plan, or identity regarding the incident in question. 12 See State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1214 (R.I. 2012) (“In cases * * * in which the evidence in question can be used for multiple purposes, some of which are permissible and others of which are not, the trial justice should issue specific instructions to the jury explaining ‘the limited purpose [or purposes] for which the jury may consider it.’” quoting State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000)). 12', 'The trial justice’s cautionary instructions provided that:', '“I again instruct you that if there is evidence that the defendant was', 'on parole at the time of the incident in question, you may not use', 'such evidence to conclude that he may be responsible for any of', 'the offenses for which he is now on trial. The fact that the', 'defendant may have been previously incarcerated or has been on', 'parole must not prejudice you into thinking that he may have', 'committed the crimes for which he is now on trial before you.', '“If the State offers such evidence, it will be for a very', 'limited purpose, and that is to provide a possible explanation for', 'the defendant’s actions subsequent to the date of the alleged', 'offenses.” The trial justice made the same point during the final jury instructions:', '“During the trial of this case, there was evidence offered', 'that the defendant was on parole as of late June, 2007. I again', 'instruct you that you may not use such evidence to prejudice you', 'into thinking that he may have committed the crimes for which he', 'is now on trial.

Frazier obtaining a DNA sample from Bishop at the ACI, the trial justice instructed:', '“The last question and answer * * * concerning the location at', 'which detective Frazier took the second buccal swab from the', 'defendant are stricken, and it is not part of the evidence.

Therefore, considering the full scope and weight of the testimonial evidence, as well as the trial justice’s specific and timely cautionary instructions to the jury, we hold that the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling to admit this evidence of defendant’s parole status was wholly within his discretion under Rule 403, because this evidence was relevant and not unduly prejudicial.', 'Finally, given the quantity and quality of the evidence inculpating Bishop, even if there were error—and it is our firm opinion that there was none—it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1215 (admission of uncharged bad conduct was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence presented against the defendant at trial). Here, Claire and Ceasar both identified Bishop’s picture from a photo array.', 'Further, the DNA samples collected from the physical evidence at the crime scene matched the samples obtained from Bishop. In addition, the hairs harvested from the ski mask matched exemplars from Bishop’s head. Moreover, Bishop testified on direct examination that he failed to seek medical aid because he did not wish to call attention to himself for fear that he would have to explain the incident to his parole officer, and defense counsel referred to Bishop’s parole in his opening statement—that Bishop was “afraid about violating his parole”—and in his closing argument when he attempted to explain away Bishop’s reluctance to report the incident or to seek medical assistance. Furthermore, Bishop’s version of the incident was riddled with inconsistencies and was ultimately undercut by the testimony of Turchetta, who testified about Reine’s telephone call', '- 24 - seeking medical assistance for Bishop, and that of Antonelli, who testified that Bishop asked him to lie on his behalf about the cause of his injuries.

28,Patricia Sullo : v. : David Greenberg. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 6, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The plaintiff, Patricia Sullo (plaintiff or Sullo), brought suit against the defendant, David Greenberg, M.D. (defendant or Greenberg), seeking damages for injuries suffered after she fell on the entrance ramp to Greenberg‟s podiatric offices. The plaintiff fell when approaching the office during a winter storm.', 'The Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on November 15, 2011. Final judgment was entered on December 16, 2011. The plaintiff appeals, claiming that a genuine issue of material fact exists, namely the presence of any ice or fallen snow on the entrance ramp at the time she fell; she alternatively claims that as her physician, Greenberg owed a heightened duty of care to her. Having carefully reviewed the statements submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. We vacate the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff had been a patient of defendant as a result of an injured tendon in her left leg suffered at her work. Greenberg performed surgery on Sullo‟s left leg and foot in October 2007. The injury that is the focus of this appeal occurred in November 2007 when Sullo was returning for her first post-operative appointment.', 'On the day of her appointment, her mother-in-law drove plaintiff from her home in Coventry to Greenberg‟s office in Pawtucket. In her deposition testimony, plaintiff averred that the weather was a mix of rain and snow and that the roads were wet.1 Greenberg‟s office was accessible by a pair of ramps, as well as by a set of stairs. The plaintiff used the ramps because she was ambulating with the aid of crutches, and her left foot was in a soft cast. Sullo alleged that, after ascending the two ramps and walking across a wooden walkway towards the office door, her left crutch slipped on the wet wood, causing her to fall hard on her left leg and foot. In her complaint, plaintiff claimed that she had slipped on accumulated snow, but during her deposition she testified that the wood surface was wet from rain and snow but was not “slushy.”', 'According to plaintiff, after she fell, Greenberg and his staff helped her into the building, placed her in an examination room, and left her until the pain began to subside. She testified that Greenberg did not examine her, but advised her at her next appointment that her foot was healing properly. Because plaintiff‟s foot pain persisted, she continued to receive treatment for her leg and foot injury from defendant and later from an orthopedic surgeon, who subsequently informed her that her injuries were permanent. The plaintiff alleges that the severity and permanent nature 1', 'Sullo‟s statements regarding the weather varied during the course of litigation. In her complaint, she stated that snow was accumulating. In her deposition, she testified that it was a mix of rain and snow and that the ground and walkway were just wet with no accumulation. In her prebriefing statement to this Court, she contends that it was not snowing when she arrived at Greenberg‟s office.', '-2- of her injuries were a proximate result of the fall outside of defendant‟s office in November 2007.', 'In August 2010, plaintiff filed suit against Greenberg, claiming that he was negligent in failing to treat the walkway, thereby causing her fall and resulting injuries. Greenberg‟s motion for summary judgment was granted on November 15, 2011. The trial justice concluded, based on the pleadings and discovery materials, that there was no dispute that the storm on the day of Sullo‟s fall included snow. Relying on “the Connecticut Rule” regarding the duty to clear fallen snow from walkways, a rule that has been adopted by this Court, see Fuller v. Housing Authority of Providence, 108 R.I. 770, 772, 279 A.2d 438, 440 (1971) (citing Reardon v. Shimelman, 128 A. 705 (Conn. 1925)), and allows a business invitor to wait until a snowstorm has ended to undertake snow removal and surface treatment, the trial justice held that defendant was justified to wait until the storm had ended before taking action to treat his office entrance. He further held that there was nothing about the circumstances before him to warrant a heightened duty of care owed by Greenberg to plaintiff and other invitees. The plaintiff timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 149-50 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Moore v. Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, 18 A.3d 541, 544 (R.I. 2011)). Examining the case from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, “[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and „if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[,]‟ we will affirm the judgment.” Id. at 150 (quoting Moore, 18 A.3d at 544).', '-3-', 'Although summary judgment is recognized as an extreme remedy, Mutual Development Corp. v.

Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 557 (R.I. 2009)), to avoid summary judgment the burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that “prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]” Id. (quoting Hill v. National Grid, 11 A.3d 110, 113 (R.I. 2011)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, plaintiff raises two arguments: (1) there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the storm in question was a snowstorm that would trigger the Connecticut Rule and thus allow a reasonable time to treat walkways, and (2) the motion justice erred in failing to recognize a heightened duty of care owed by defendant as plaintiff‟s physician.', 'Genuine Issue of Material Fact Regarding the Storm', 'In order to demonstrate negligence, “a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff,” in addition to a breach of that duty, injury, and a causal link between the breach and the injury. Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 129 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Mills v. State Sales, Inc., 824 A.2d 461, 467 (R.I. 2003)). In this case, the trial justice granted summary judgment, having concluded that Greenberg did not owe a duty to plaintiff to treat the entranceway to his building. We are not persuaded that the trial justice had before him the requisite uncontested facts that are necessary to reach this conclusion.', 'The trial justice based his findings on an application of the Connecticut Rule, which sets forth the duty of a landlord or business invitor regarding treatment of surfaces during and after a snowstorm. Benaski v. Weinberg, 899 A.2d 499, 502 (R.I. 2006) (citing Fuller, 108 R.I. at 772, 279 A.2d at 440). Under the Connecticut Rule, a landlord or business invitor clearly has a duty', '-4- to his tenants or invitees to clear snow accumulation and treat surfaces impacted by a storm. Id. at 502 (citing Fuller, 108 R.I. at 772, 279 A.2d at 440). However, this duty does not arise until a reasonable time after the storm has ended. Id. at 503 (citing Fuller, 108 R.I. at 774, 279 A.2d at 441); see also Barenbaum v. Richardson, 114 R.I. 87, 93, 328 A.2d 731, 734 (1974).', 'The purpose of the Connecticut Rule is to allow landlords or business invitors a reasonable time to clear a natural accumulation of snow and ice after winter storms typical of an area like New England. See Berardis v. Louangxay, 969 A.2d 1288, 1292 (R.I. 2009) (citing Benaski, 899 A.2d at 503). The landlord or business invitor is not required to “catch[ ] the flakes before they hit the ground.” Id. at 1293 (quoting Benaski, 899 A.2d at 503). Because the rationale is to allow a reasonable time to treat surfaces rather than ineffectually fight a continuing storm, the Connecticut Rule is intended to apply to ongoing winter storms resulting in an accumulation of snow, ice, or frozen rain. See Barenbaum, 114 R.I. at 89, 93, 328 A.2d at 732, 734 (Connecticut Rule applies to a “„slight dusting‟ which melted rapidly”).', 'Here, plaintiff contends that the Connecticut Rule addresses a business invitor‟s duty to remove snow from the walkway. However, plaintiff claims that the walkway where she fell was wet rather than covered with accumulated snow. In contrast, Greenberg points out that it was snowing at the time of Sullo‟s appointment and that Sullo herself admitted this fact. Because of this disagreement, Sullo argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact and that, therefore, the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment. We agree that there exists a genuine issue of fact about the extent of the snow, if any, particularly at the location where plaintiff fell.', 'The plaintiff contends on appeal that she fell because the walkway was wet and slippery, and her complaint alleges that she “slip[ped] on snow that had accumulated on the surface of the entrance ramp[.]” Additionally, in her deposition, plaintiff testified that the weather that day was', '-5- a mix of rain and snow that impacted the walkway although she claimed that there was no accumulated snow. The trial justice, having noted plaintiff‟s various descriptions of the weather, properly made no attempt to reconcile these disparities. However, viewing plaintiff‟s deposition testimony and the pleadings in a light most favorable to plaintiff, we are satisfied that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether there was an accumulation of snow or ice sufficient to invoke the Connecticut Rule or whether, at the time plaintiff fell, the snow had turned to rain or it had ceased snowing. The only undisputed facts relevant to this case seem to be that plaintiff fell on a wet surface in mid-November during a precipitation event.', 'These uncontested facts are insufficient to justify a grant of summary judgment based on the Connecticut Rule.', 'The existence of a legal duty is a question of law properly decided by the court. Ouch v Khea, 963 A.2d 630, 633 (R.I. 2009) (citing Martin v. Marciano, 871 A.2d 911, 915 (R.I. 2005)). However, the court must base its holdings on the facts of the case, either as undisputed by the parties or as decided by a jury. Berardis, 969 A.2d at 1291 (citing Benaski, 899 A.2d at 502). In this case, the parties disagree as to the extent of the storm on the day of Sullo‟s fall, which leaves unanswered the question of whether the Connecticut Rule controls as a matter of law. Therefore, additional factual findings are required to determine whether defendant was under a duty to treat his entranceway before the storm had ended, and the trial justice‟s grant of summary judgment was in error.', 'Greenberg Did Not Owe a Heightened Duty of Care', 'The plaintiff additionally contends that, even if the Connecticut Rule ordinarily would protect a business invitor in Greenberg‟s position, the rule should not protect him in this case because plaintiff was owed a heightened duty of care by her physician. We disagree.', 'This Court has recognized that the Connecticut Rule relieves landlords and business', '-6- invitors of their duty to treat their premises “only in the absence of unusual circumstances.” Terry v. Central Auto Radiators, Inc., 732 A.2d 713, 717 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Cooks v. O‟Brien Properties, Inc., 710 A.2d 788, 792 (Conn. App. Ct. 1998)). When the business invitor has “exacerbated and increased the risk” to his or her business invitees, he or she then holds a heightened duty of care to the invitees. Id. at 718. This Court found an “unusual circumstance” in Terry. Id. at 717. There, the plaintiff brought her car to the defendant-mechanic‟s shop during a snowstorm. Id. at 714. When the plaintiff returned, the defendant instructed her to retrieve her car from a back lot that had been left untreated, where the plaintiff fell. Id. at 715.', 'This Court held that the defendant owed a heightened duty of care to the plaintiff because the defendant had moved her car to a more dangerous location, thereby exacerbating the risk to the plaintiff, an invitee. Terry, 732 A.2d at 717-18. Recognizing that the plaintiff had accepted some risk in coming to retrieve her car during a snowstorm, this Court emphasized that the risk she had anticipated—retrieving the car from the front lot—was “more limited” than the risk she was forced to incur—walking a greater distance through difficult terrain. Id. at 717.', 'Unlike the plaintiff in Terry, who found herself faced with a risk significantly greater than expected, Sullo should have anticipated having to traverse wet ground to enter Greenberg‟s office on the day of the storm. See Terry, 732 A.2d at 717-18. Greenberg did not exacerbate this risk. He took no action to change the distance or surface texture that Sullo encountered— unlike the defendant in Terry, who moved the plaintiff‟s car to a more treacherous location. See id. at 715. Sullo was not faced with the same Hobson‟s Choice that the plaintiff in Terry faced,2 2', 'This Court noted that the Terry plaintiff was forced to choose between accepting the increased risk to retrieve her car from the back lot or returning home “as best she could” without her car. Terry v. Central Auto Radiators, Inc., 732 A.2d 713, 718 (R.I. 1999).', '-7- but could instead have changed her mind and rescheduled her appointment with Greenberg or waited for help from her mother-in-law before ascending the ramp.', 'Greenberg‟s status as the plaintiff‟s physician does not heighten the duty of care that he owes to her. Although a business invitor has a duty to provide reasonably safe public areas, the invitor need not become “a guarantor for the safety of his [invitees].” Benaski, 899 A.2d at 503 (quoting Fuller, 108 R.I. at 774, 279 A.2d at 441). That duty is not heightened simply because the invitor is a physician. Greenberg owed the plaintiff the duty of care of a physician in regard to his medical treatment of her leg and foot, and he owed her the standard duty of care of a business invitor in regard to his entranceway. See Willis, 954 A.2d at 129 (declining to “creat[e] a new frontier” by recognizing further social-host liability in the face of established precedent).', 'Conclusion', 'Having concluded that there is a genuine issue of material fact in this case, we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to her day in court.

29,"Rachel Rafaelian : v. : Perfecto Iron Works, Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 9, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The petitioner, Rachel Rafaelian (Rafaelian or petitioner), appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting the respondent‟s, Perfecto Iron Works, Inc. (Perfecto or respondent), motion to vacate a default judgment and final decree. Rafaelian argues that the trial justice ignored both Rule 81(a)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and G.L. 1956 § 44-9-24, which precludes the Superior Court from vacating a final decree foreclosing the right of redemption after a tax sale. In response, Perfecto argues that the trial justice did not err in vacating the decree, which Perfecto asserts was entered erroneously; Perfecto claims that the decree is void because Perfecto timely answered the petition seeking to foreclose its right of redemption.', 'The trial justice, having found that a timely answer had been filed, held that the decree erroneously was entered and granted Perfecto‟s motion to vacate. After hearing the arguments of counsel and carefully examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that', '-1- cause has not been shown; we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 22, 2011, Rafaelian filed, in the Superior Court, a petition to foreclose the right of redemption arising from a tax sale of property located at 1107 Westminster Street, Providence, Rhode Island, and designated by the tax assessor as lot 50, plat 32 (the property). That petition indicated that Rafaelian had obtained tax title to the property on June 25, 2010, at a sale conducted by the Providence Water Supply Board for nonpayment of user fees. The propriety of the sale has not been challenged. The petition also stated that “more than one year from the date of said sale has elapsed and no redemption has been made; the proceedings aforesaid have been conducted according to law[.]” Furthermore, the petition indicated that the named respondents—Perfecto, the Rhode Island Division of Taxation, and the Internal Revenue Service—held an interest in the property, and that each of these respondents was provided notice of the petition via certified mail.1', 'It is undisputed that Perfecto filed an answer on October 14, 2011, and that this filing was noted on the court‟s docket sheet. Apparently, neither Rafaelian nor her attorney received a copy of the answer. On October 18, 2011, believing that no responsive pleading had been filed, Rafaelian filed a motion for entry of default and final decree. By affidavit of her attorney, Rafaelian alleged that respondents had failed to plead or otherwise defend as to petitioner‟s petition. The default motion was set for hearing on October 28, 2011; however, it is not clear whether any of the respondent parties were provided notice of this hearing. Ultimately, on October 28, 2011, a final decree was entered declaring “[t]hat all rights of redemption [in and to 1', 'The record reflects that neither the Rhode Island Division of Taxation nor the Internal Revenue Service entered appearances at any stage of these proceedings.', '-2- the property] are forever foreclosed and barred” and vesting “[t]he legal and equitable title to the property * * * in [Rafaelian].”', 'On November 3, 2011, Perfecto filed a motion to vacate the default and the final decree. On November 14, 2011, Rafaelian objected to Perfecto‟s motion. At the hearing on the motion to vacate, Perfecto argued that both the default and the final decree were void.', 'Perfecto established that its answer was filed on October 14, 2011, that it did not receive notice of the hearing on Rafaelian‟s motion for default, and that the relief it sought did not turn on whether a decree foreclosing the right of redemption could be vacated pursuant to the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Perfecto argued that because the name and address of petitioner‟s attorney were not set forth in the motion seeking foreclosure, the answer was mailed to Rafaelian at the address listed on her petition.2 Further, Perfecto stated that, after the petition was filed, there had been some communication with Rafaelian‟s counsel about the redemption costs but that Perfecto was not aware of the impending hearing on Rafaelian‟s motion for entry of default.', 'In response, Rafaelian argued that the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide a procedural vehicle to vacate the default and the final decree foreclosing the right of redemption and that, therefore, Perfecto‟s motion “is completely defective and not allowed.” According to Rafaelian, Perfecto was notified by letter, sent by facsimile, “that this matter is set down for foreclosure on October the 28th, 2011.”', 'Counsel averred that this facsimile communication was sent before the hearing date and in response to Perfecto‟s verbal request for redemption costs. In an ensuing exchange between Rafaelian and the trial justice, the question arose as to who bears the responsibility of searching the court file to see if an answer had been filed before the court enters a default. The trial justice declared that it was not the court‟s 2', 'Apparently, this address was counsel‟s office; but, because the answer was addressed to Rafaelian, rather than counsel, he did not receive it.', '-3- obligation to determine that there was no answer in the file before entering a default. Counsel also argued that, although he had not received a copy of Perfecto‟s answer, it was a common practice for delinquent respondents to request redemption costs and then elect not to answer the petition, thus allowing the default to enter.', 'The trial justice concluded that the default erroneously was entered in this case because Perfecto‟s answer was timely filed.', 'The trial justice based her decision on Perfecto‟s “meritorious defense” and the general policy of the courts to favor redemptions. The trial justice stated that she arrived at her conclusion by employing the principles of equity and by relying on “the Zeus case,”3 and not the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.4', 'An order was entered on November 15, 2011, granting Perfecto‟s motion and vacating the entry of default and the final decree.', 'The order enjoined petitioner “from alienating, transferring, encumbering, concealing, selling, or otherwise disposing of” the property until further order of the court. The petitioner‟s timely notice of appeal from the November 15, 2011 order was filed on November 28, 2011. Before this Court, the parties raise arguments that are identical to those posited to the trial justice.', 'Discussion', 'We begin our analysis by noting that “[a] tax sale foreclosure proceeding „is a unique procedure created by statute for a limited purpose[:] to provide a forum for the exercise of the 3', 'The trial justice likely was referring to Zeus Realty Co. v. Jaral Realty, Inc., 653 A.2d 70, 70 (R.I. 1995), where a plaintiff in an unsuccessful appeal sought to overturn a Superior Court order vacating an entry of default based upon the finding “that the plaintiff‟s notice to the defendants was premature since it was sent prior to the setting of a return day and prior to the presentation of a title examiner‟s report to the Superior Court.” On appeal, Rafaelian argues that Zeus is inapplicable to her case. Because we uphold the trial justice‟s decision vacating the default, we need not reach this issue. 4', 'The parties then informed the trial justice that, after the default entered, the property in question was transferred from Rafaelian to an LLC. The trial justice directed the entry of a restraining order enjoining further transfer of the property.', '-4- right to redeem the subject land.‟” ABAR Associates v.

Also, as the travel of this case indicates, foreclosure proceedings move at lightning speed.', 'Rafaelian argues to this Court that Perfecto‟s motion to vacate was filed in contravention of § 44-9-24, which provides, in pertinent part, that “no decree [foreclosing the right of redemption] shall be vacated except in a separate action instituted within one year following entry of the decree and in no event for any reason, later than one year following the entry of decree[,]” and only on very limited grounds.6 Clearly, with respect to any validly entered decree, 5', 'Specifically, Rule 81(a)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]hese rules do not apply to the following proceedings: * * * Petitions for foreclosure of redemption of interests in land sold for nonpayment of taxes * * *.” 6', 'In its entirety, G.L. 1956 § 44-9-24 provides:', '“The title conveyed by a tax collector‟s deed shall be absolute after', 'foreclosure of the right of redemption by decree of the superior court as provided', 'in this chapter.

We are confronted, however, with a situation in which the decree of the Superior Court was entered in error. The decree is therefore voidable and its erroneous entry falls outside the safeguards of § 44-9-24.', 'In this case, the default decree was entered based on the representation to the court that Perfecto had not filed an answer to the petition. In fact, Perfecto had answered the petition and had done so in a timely manner. Accordingly, because the court mistakenly ordered the entry of default—as evidenced by the filing of the answer, which filing plainly appears in the electronic docket sheet—the trial justice properly vacated the decree.

30,: v. : Beverly Plouff. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. A Superior Court jury found that the plaintiffs, Gregory H. and Christina G. Andrews, were entitled to the return of their deposit after a residential real estate transaction came to naught. On appeal, we must decide whether the trial court properly included prejudgment interest in the judgment for plaintiffs.', 'This case is before the Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the record, the memoranda submitted to this Court on behalf of the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the award of prejudgment interest.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arose from a failed real estate transaction. In June of 2008, defendant Beverly Plouff’s property on Shore Road in Tiverton was listed for sale. On June 29 of that year, plaintiffs Gregory and Christina Andrews, being interested in purchasing the property, signed a purchase and sales agreement and submitted it to defendant. The agreement stated that the purchase price was $490,000. As provided for in the agreement, plaintiffs deposited $49,000 with defendant’s real estate agent to be held in escrow until the parties closed on the transaction.', 'On July 2, 2008, defendant signed the agreement. However, she also made certain handwritten alterations to the contract. For example, the original agreement signed by plaintiffs provided that defendant would ―pay the cost of [a] new septic design and installation‖; the handwritten changes, however, placed a cap of $30,000 on that obligation. Further, the original agreement provided that defendant would ―pay for installation of [a] new water tank and systems‖; again, defendant’s handwritten changes placed a cap of $10,000 on that obligation and also imposed an obligation on plaintiffs to ―make earnest attempt[s] to‖ connect to a well before defendant would be responsible for the installation of a new water tank and system.', 'On December 1, 2008, plaintiffs Gregory and Christina Andrews filed a complaint against defendant Beverly Plouff in Newport Superior Court. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that defendant’s handwritten alterations were ―material changes‖ which ―constituted a counter-offer, not an acceptance of [plaintiffs’] offer to purchase‖ the property. The plaintiffs alleged that the parties then engaged in further negotiations, but could not reach an agreement. The plaintiffs’ complaint stated that, ―[s]ince there was never a valid contract between the parties', '-2- for the purchase and sale of the [property], the [plaintiffs] are entitled to the return of the $49,000 deposit.‖', 'On January 31, 2011, the jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs’ favor. Pursuant to the verdict form, the jury found as follows:', '―Plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence that', 'they did not enter into a binding, written contract with Defendant', 'to buy the Defendant’s property for $490,000 [on] Shore Road,', 'Tiverton, Rhode Island, in July, 2008 and [are] entitled to the', 'return of their deposit of $49,000.00.‖ That same day, the trial court entered a civil judgment on the verdict, which added 12 percent interest per annum to the $49,000 judgment. The amount of interest was $15,239.67,1 which brought the total amount of the judgment to $64,239.67.', 'On February 9, 2011, defendant filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. She argued that plaintiffs were ―entitled to [the] return of their deposit of $49,000 but with no interest thereon.‖ The trial court held a hearing on the motion on May 13, 2011; the hearing justice denied defendant’s motion from the bench. On May 20, 2011, the court entered a written order memorializing its decision. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the motion justice erred when he denied her motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e). She argues that, under G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10, prejudgment interest applies only to awards for ―pecuniary damages.‖ She contends that the trial 1', 'The amount of interest appears to have been calculated from June 29, 2008—the day that plaintiffs deposited the $49,000 with defendant.', '-3- court should not have included prejudgment interest because plaintiffs’ award—viz., the return of their deposit—was a reimbursement rather than an award of pecuniary damages.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Since the sole issue raised by defendant on appeal presents an issue of law, we review that issue de novo. Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'It is our opinion that the return of plaintiffs’ deposit does not fall within the category of ―pecuniary damages‖ under § 9-21-10(a) and that, therefore, plaintiffs were not entitled to prejudgment interest.', 'Statutory prejudgment interest is governed by § 9-21-10(a). That statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a', 'decision made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the', 'clerk of the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of', 'twelve percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of', 'action accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered', 'therein.‖ (Emphasis added.)', 'The plaintiffs first argue that the award of prejudgment interest should be affirmed because § 9-21-10(a) provides for interest in two scenarios: (1) when ―a verdict is rendered‖ and (2) when ―a decision [is] made for pecuniary damages.‖ In other words, they contend that the General Assembly’s use of the disjunctive ―or‖ means that the ―pecuniary damages‖ requirement applies only to ―decision[s] made,‖ and not to ―verdict[s] * * * rendered.‖ They argue that, since their award came from a jury verdict, they are entitled to prejudgment interest regardless of whether the award constitutes ―pecuniary damages.‖', '-4-', 'We disagree with plaintiffs’ statutory analysis. If we accepted plaintiffs’ argument, we would have to conclude that the General Assembly intended prejudgment interest to apply to every jury ―verdict‖—yet, by contrast, only to those ―decisions‖ by a trial justice which involve ―pecuniary damages.‖ We perceive no basis for concluding that the General Assembly created such an arbitrary (and indeed absurd) distinction. See, e.g., Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011) (―[S]tatutes should not be construed to achieve meaningless or absurd results.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is our opinion that the ―pecuniary damages‖ requirement of § 9-21-10(a) applies to both jury verdicts and trial justices’ decisions.', 'We therefore must address whether or not the return of the deposit in this case represents ―pecuniary damages‖ under § 9-21-10(a). We addressed this issue in Bogosian v. Bederman, 823 A.2d 1117 (R.I. 2003). In that case, the plaintiffs agreed to buy real estate from the defendants. Id. at 1118–19. The parties signed an agreement, but the sale never closed ―due to the rapid deterioration of the relationship between the parties.‖ Id. at 1119. The plaintiffs filed a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against the defendants. Id. After a bench trial, plaintiffs were eventually awarded the return of their deposit plus statutory interest. Id. On appeal, we held as follows:', '―The return of a deposit is simply a reimbursement rather', 'than an award of pecuniary damages, and thus the plaintiffs are not', 'entitled to the addition of statutory interest.‖ Id. at 1121 (citing', 'Rhode Island Insurer’s Insolvency Fund v. Leviton Manufacturing', 'Co., 763 A.2d 590, 597–98 (R.I. 2000)).', 'We believe that Bogosian controls the case that is now before us. In their complaint, the plaintiffs’ prayer for relief requested the trial court simply to ―[o]rder defendant to return to them their deposit.‖ Further, the jury’s verdict form indicates that the jury found that the plaintiffs were ―entitled to the return of their deposit.‖ Bogosian clearly indicates that such relief is a reimbursement, not an award of ―pecuniary damages‖ that would entitle the plaintiffs to statutory', '-5- interest under § 9-21-10(a).2 We therefore hold that the motion justice erred when he denied the defendant’s Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment to remove prejudgment interest from the award.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the award of prejudgment interest in this case. The record may be remanded to the Superior Court. 2', 'We note that our holding does not preclude every plaintiff from recovering prejudgment interest whenever a deposit is at issue. For example, if a plaintiff were awarded damages in a breach of contract case involving a deposit, then that plaintiff might well be entitled to statutory interest under G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10(a). In the present case, however, (1) plaintiffs’ complaint simply requested the return of their deposit and (2) the jury’s verdict form stated only that plaintiffs were entitled to the return of their deposit. The complaint did not include any allegations that plaintiffs were entitled to pecuniary damages, nor did the jury make any such findings. Accordingly, plaintiffs are not entitled to recover prejudgment interest.

31,Elisa M. Catley : v. : Mark D. Sampson.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Mark D. Sampson (defendant) appeals pro se from a Family Court order denying his motion to modify custody. The defendant contends that, because his conviction for second-degree child abuse had been vacated by this Court and the charges subsequently were dismissed, the hearing justice should have awarded him full custody even in the face of his failure to complete required domestic-violence counseling and drug testing. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Elisa M. Catley (plaintiff) is the mother of two boys: Bobby, born in 2001, and Alex, born in 2004. 1 The plaintiff filed complaints for paternity against defendant in 2004, asserting that he was the biological father of both boys. At the time, defendant was serving a three-year 1', 'Because the boys are minor children, we shall use pseudonyms to protect their privacy.', '-1- sentence at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI). The defendant admitted that he was the father of Bobby, but he initially questioned his paternity of Alex. Paternity testing established that Alex, too, was his child. The defendant then moved for visitation and to have the children’s last name changed to his. On December 7, 2006, a Family Court magistrate entered an order allowing defendant reasonable rights of visitation.', 'In April 2007, defendant filed a motion to adjudge plaintiff in contempt of the 2006 order granting visitation. The hearing magistrate found plaintiff to be in technical contempt and issued a second order specifying a more detailed visitation schedule, including overnight stays.', 'On August 4, 2007, plaintiff was assisting three-year-old Alex in the bathroom when she noticed welts, cuts, and bruises all over the child’s buttocks. Alex and his brother had just returned from staying with defendant. When plaintiff asked her son what had happened to him, he replied, “[D]addy spanked me but it’s okay now mommy, it doesn’t need ice anymore.” The plaintiff then received a telephone call from defendant; during the conversation he admitted to hitting Alex, saying, “[B]ut don’t get it wrong[,] that wasn’t from me hitting him once, his behind was like that from me hitting him multiple times.” 2 The plaintiff photographed the child’s injuries and then took him to a pediatrician’s office to be examined.', 'Alex was examined by physician assistant Cheryl Trager, who reported “significant ecchymosis on buttocks, 2 linear horizontal abrasions on [left] buttock [which were] 2 cm. [and] parallel.” According to Ms. Trager’s report, when she asked who caused the bruises, Alex responded, “Daddy spanked me,” and also told her that he had been hit by hand and with a bat. The police report states that Ms. Trager also examined Bobby, who admitted that he had been 2', 'In a controlled telephone call between plaintiff and defendant, recorded by the Rhode Island State Police on August 6, 2007, defendant explained that he hit Bobby to “correct” him for urinating in his pants and for refusing to eat because he felt sick.', '-2- spanked by his father during prior visits. Ms. Trager reported the incident to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). According to the police report, a DCYF investigator, after interviewing the children, indicated defendant for “excessive inappropriate discipline causing cut[s,] bruises and welts.” The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with second-degree child abuse.', 'On August 7, 2007, plaintiff filed an emergency motion for custody in Family Court, asking that she be granted sole custody of the two boys and that “all visitation [be] stopped.” On August 15, 2007, a police report established that defendant had been arrested again after a traffic stop in which cocaine and an open container of alcohol were found in his car. The defendant admitted that the cocaine was his and that “he deals just to try to make a living and feed his kids.” The defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance, as well as citations for driving with an open alcohol container and without proof of insurance.', 'On October 4, 2007, plaintiff filed a second motion, again seeking sole custody and asking that visitation be terminated. A hearing was held on plaintiff’s motions on January 31, 2008. 3 On February 14, 2008, a Family Court magistrate issued a written judgment, which included the following findings of fact:', '“1)', 'The [c]ourt finds that the defendant, Mark Sampson, caused', 'physical harm to his son, [Alex], during the summer of 2007.

The defendant must attend and successfully complete domestic', 'violence counseling to the satisfaction of the [c]ourt. The', 'counseling must be given by a certified batterer’s intervention', 'counselor that the defendant has never met with before.', '“b. The defendant must attend and successfully complete a', 'substance abuse program and submit to random urine screens and', 'breathalyzers. Said screens and breathalyzers must be done for at', 'least a six-month period of time and must all be negative during', 'that period of time.”', 'In April 2008, defendant was convicted of second-degree child abuse after a bench trial. 4 See State v. Sampson, 24 A.3d 1131, 1132, 1133, 1137 (R.I. 2011). The defendant filed an appeal to this Court, arguing that he had not “knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive[d] 4', 'The defendant received a five-year sentence with fifteen months to serve and the remainder suspended with probation.

We vacated the conviction and remanded for a new trial, finding that the trial justice “erroneously suggested to defendant that the decision” to waive a jury trial is made by counsel rather than by the client. Id. at 1132, 1140, 1141-42.', 'On remand, the charges were dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Shortly thereafter, defendant filed a motion for sole custody in Family Court, stating that, because plaintiff “charged [him] with second degree child abuse,” but he had prevailed on appeal and the charges subsequently were dismissed, “for this [he is] asking full custody.” The defendant’s motion was heard on January 20, 2012, at which time he testified that he “wasn’t going to do a domestic class for teaching and correcting [his] child.” Although he contended that he had done some urine testing two years prior, defendant did not proffer any evidence demonstrating six months of negative urine screens and breathalyzers.', 'Further, defendant stated that he intended to get a medical marijuana license to help deal with stress. The hearing justice denied the motion, finding that “not one (1) scintilla of evidence has been introduced to prove that [d]efendant * * * satisfied the conditions” set forth in the 2008 custody order. The defendant timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court will review a “Family Court justice’s ‘denial of a motion to modify a prior custody award to determine whether an abuse of discretion has occurred.’” Guertin v. Guertin, 870 A.2d 1011, 1017 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Suddes v. Spinelli, 703 A.2d 605, 607 (R.I. 1997)). “[W]e will ‘not disturb findings of fact made by a Family Court justice unless the individual taking the appeal can show that such findings are clearly wrong or that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived evidence relevant to the issues decided.’” Id. (quoting D’Onofrio v.', '-5- D’Onofrio, 738 A.2d 1081, 1083 (R.I. 1999)). A modification of a custody decree should not be allowed by the Family Court justice “unless there has been a showing by the moving party by a preponderance of evidence that the conditions or circumstances existing at the time the decree was entered have so changed that it should be modified in the interest of the child[’s] welfare.” Id. (quoting Kettelle v. Kettelle, 707 A.2d 268, 269 (R.I. 1998)). “Until and unless the moving party meets this burden, the prior custody award should remain intact.” Id. (quoting Suddes, 703 A.2d at 607).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant asserted at oral argument that, because his conviction was vacated and ultimately was dismissed, the Family Court’s 2008 order awarding sole custody to plaintiff should be modified, and he should be awarded sole custody of the two children. At the same time, defendant appears to argue that the Rule 48(a) dismissal of the criminal information relating to the child-abuse charge should nullify the 2008 order, leaving in its stead the 2007 order, which provided for shared custody and visitation. The plaintiff asserts that, because the 2008 order was based on the hearing justice’s findings of fact made independent of and prior to the criminal conviction, the dismissal of that conviction has no effect on the order. Further, plaintiff avers that defendant has not complied with the conditions required to prove that it would be in the best interest of the children to modify the custody order because he refuses to attend domestic-violence counseling and has not had six months of clean alcohol and drug screens.', 'To prevail on a motion to modify child custody, “the moving party must show, ‘by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the conditions or circumstances existing at the time the [original] decree was entered have so changed that [the decree] should be modified in the interest', '-6- of the child[’s] welfare.’” Vicente v. Vicente, 950 A.2d 461, 462 (R.I. 2008) (mem.) (quoting Suddes, 703 A.2d at 607).', 'Further, “[u]nless the movant meets this stringent evidentiary standard, the prior custody decision should remain intact.” Id.', 'The defendant offers the vacating of his conviction and the dismissal of the second- degree child abuse charge as the changed circumstance that he argues is sufficient to modify the existing custody decree. The defendant seems to suggest that the dismissal invalidates the existing custody order and somehow turns back the clock to the prior order that allowed for joint custody and visitation. Quite simply, defendant is mistaken. The Family Court magistrate made ten findings of fact before issuing the 2008 order.', 'Each of those findings was based on testimony given and exhibits entered in open court, not on the criminal proceeding that was later dismissed. In fact, the criminal proceeding in which defendant was originally convicted took place two months after the Family Court order was entered. Finally, the standard employed by the hearing justice in motions to modify custody is a “fair preponderance of the evidence,” which falls well short of the standard required for a criminal conviction, “beyond a reasonable doubt.” See Vicente, 950 A.2d at 462; State v. Desrosiers, 559 A.2d 641, 645 (R.I. 1989). In short, while the two adjudications arise from the same act (hitting Alex), they are otherwise wholly unrelated, and the vacating and dismissal of one has no effect on the other.', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16 governs custody determinations. Section 15-5-16(d)(1) states that “the court shall provide for the reasonable right of visitation by the natural parent not having custody of the children, except upon the showing of cause why the right should not be granted.”', 'Pursuant to § 15-5-16(d)(3), “[a] judicial determination that the child has been physically or sexually abused by the natural parent shall constitute sufficient cause to deny the right of visitation.” The Family Court’s findings, made after the magistrate heard testimony and', '-7- reviewed evidence, are such a judicial determination; there is no requirement that the judicial determination must rise to the level of a criminal conviction. In reviewing her well-reasoned decision and order, we can perceive no evidence of an abuse of discretion by the magistrate.', 'Section 15-5-16(d)(3) provides for later review of orders denying custody, to “determine what, if any, action the parent has taken to rehabilitate himself or herself and whether the denial of visitation continues to be in the child’s best interests.” Accordingly, in the 2008 order, the Family Court magistrate set forth specific conditions that the defendant would need to satisfy in order to have visitation restored: He had to successfully complete domestic-violence counseling and a drug program, with six months of negative urine screens and breathalyzers.', 'These conditions seem to have been carefully crafted so as to ascertain the defendant’s rehabilitation regarding the behaviors that led to his being denied visitation. Moreover, § 15-5-16(d)(4) provides that the court “may order a natural parent who has been denied the right of visitation due to physical or sexual abuse of his or her child to engage in counseling” and further provides that failure to engage in that counseling “shall constitute sufficient cause to deny visitation.” Unfortunately, the defendant has not satisfied either condition. He has not attended a single domestic-violence counseling session and, in fact, told the hearing justice that he “was not going to participate in a domestic violence class for correcting my child.” Further, in his Rule 12A statement, he declared: “I stand by that decision today.” Additionally, although he participated in a Phoenix House program for approximately eight weeks in 2009, the defendant has not provided any documentation of negative drug and alcohol screens. We are satisfied that the hearing justice was not clearly wrong, nor did she overlook or misconceive evidence in finding that “not one (1) scintilla of evidence [was provided] to prove that [the] [d]efendant [has]', '-8- satisfied the conditions” set forth in the order. Accordingly, we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion for the hearing justice to deny the defendant’s motion to modify custody.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Family Court.

Mr. Beauregard alleged that the codefendants and the attorney defendants ―willfully and maliciously acted to delay, frustrate and interfere with‖ Mr. Beauregard’s title to his property on Umbrella Way. Specifically, the slander of title claim alleged that the attorney defendants’ ―recording of the Notice of Intent on Plaintiff’s Property constitute[d] a slander of title on the Plaintiff’s Property.‖ In the count alleging intentional interference with prospective advantage, Mr. Beauregard alleged that the notice of intent had ―been a cloud on the title to Plaintiff’s Property since the date of recording,‖ which had ―prevented Plaintiff from developing the Property.‖4 4', 'In his answers to interrogatories in this case, Mr. Beauregard indicated that he could not build or improve his property until he received title insurance and a mortgage.

In his order, the motion justice found that Attorney Brule had ―established that he acted without malice or specific intent.‖ The motion justice held that Mr. Beauregard’s claim of slander of title—which requires a plaintiff to prove that a defendant uttered or published a false statement that was malicious—therefore failed. The motion justice also recognized that Attorney Brule’s recording of the notice of intent under § 34- 7-6 ―did not slander the title of Mr. Beauregard’s property‖ because ―it concerned and protected the title to the property owned by those who recorded the notice‖—viz., the codefendants.

Simply put, it is our view that Mr. Beauregard may not recover on his claims for slander of title and intentional interference because the notice of intent had nothing to do with the property that Mr. Beauregard wished to develop.', 'A', 'Adverse Possession', 'We begin with a brief review of some basic principles of our adverse possession law. In Rhode Island, a claimant may obtain title to property upon a showing that his use of the property was ―actual, open, notorious, hostile, under claim of right, continuous, and exclusive for at least ten years.‖ Corrigan v.

Much of this state’s adverse possession law has been codified in chapter 7 of title 34 of the General Laws. Within that chapter, the General Assembly has provided landowners of record with a statutory mechanism to interrupt potential claims of adverse possession—viz., § 34-7-6. Pursuant to that statute, a landowner may interrupt such a claim by serving the rival claimant with a written notice of intent to dispute. Such a notice may be employed ―[w]henever the legal owner of any lands anticipates that any other person or persons may obtain title to those lands‖ by adverse possession. Id. According to the statute, the notice must inform the potential claimant of the landowner’s ―intention to dispute any right arising from [the claimant’s] claim or use.‖ Id. Importantly, the statute also requires the landowner to record the notice of intent within three months ―in the records of land evidence in the town in which the land is situated.‖ Id.', '-7-', 'B', 'The Slander of Title Claim', 'Mr. Beauregard’s slander of title claim is based on the attorney defendants’ filing of the notice of intent; he alleged that the Notice ―constitute[d] a slander of title on‖ his lot. A slander of title action requires a plaintiff to prove (1) that the alleged wrongdoer uttered or published a false statement about the plaintiff’s ownership of real estate, (2) that the uttering or publishing was malicious, and (3) that the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as a result. See Eastern Motor Inns, Inc. v. Ricci, 565 A.2d 1265, 1273 (R.I. 1989); see also Narragansett Improvement Co. v. Wheeler, 21 A.3d 430, 441 (R.I. 2011); Arnold Road Realty Associates, LLC v.

By its plain terms—and in accordance with the statute—the notice of intent prepared by Attorney Brule references only his clients’ property.', 'There simply is no statement in the notice of intent—false or otherwise—about the lot that Mr. Beauregard owned and wished to develop. Mr. Beauregard therefore failed to establish 5', 'In support of his argument, Mr. Beauregard points to our decision in Louttit v. Alexander, 44 R.I. 257, 260, 116 A. 882, 883 (1922) where we held that a notice of intent was ―a cloud upon the [plaintiff’s] title which would be likely to seriously interfere with his rightful enjoyment of his estate * * *.‖ There is, however, a crucial difference between Louttit and Mr. Beauregard’s case. The defendant in Louttit recorded a notice of intent which asserted his right to the plaintiff’s property. In Mr. Beauregard’s case, the notice of intent simply asserted the codefendants’ right to their own property. The notice of intent at issue in the present case says absolutely nothing about Mr. Beauregard’s property. 6', 'Our analysis is not affected by the hand-written notations about ―Grantor‖ and ―Grantee‖ on the notice of intent. The General Assembly ―has prescribed the duties of a recorder of deeds to record instruments and has specified what is required for a deed to be a legally sufficient instrument.‖ Bionomic Church of Rhode Island v. Gerardi, 414 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 1980). Specifically, a town clerk has a statutory duty to ―make and keep a separate alphabetical general index of all deeds, mortgages, and other instruments recorded * * *.‖ General Laws 1956 § 34- 13-5(a). Mr. Beauregard argues that, as a matter of law, notices of intent should never be indexed under the heading of ―Grantor.‖ Whether or not that is an accurate statement of the law (and we need not pass upon that issue), it was the duty of the town clerk—not Attorney Brule— to record and index the notice of intent in accordance with the General Laws. See Gerardi, 414 A.2d at 476 (noting that the town clerk is ―bound to comply with the applicable [recording] statutes‖).', '-9- an essential element of his claim of slander of title; the notice of intent was not a ―false statement about [Mr. Beauregard’s] ownership of real estate.‖ See Arnold Road Realty, 873 A.2d at 125 (internal quotation marks omitted).

It may well be true that the title insurer and the lender misinterpreted the notice of intent and therefore made decisions that prevented Mr. Beauregard from developing his lot. However, that does not change the fact that the notice of intent does not contain a false statement about Mr. Beauregard’s lot. The plain, blunt fact is that Mr. Beauregard has failed ―to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [his] case * * *.‖ See Lavoie, 918 A.2d at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted). It follows that the attorney defendants were entitled to summary judgment with respect to the claim of slander of title.', 'C', 'The Intentional Interference Claim', 'A similar analysis applies to Mr. Beauregard’s second claim.

See Lavoie v.

33,No. 2011-326-Appeal. (05-138-02) In re Isabella M. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The respondents, Cristin B. (mother) and Mark M. (father) appeal from a Family Court decree terminating their parental rights to their children, Isabella M. (Bella) and James Cody B. (Cody). On appeal, the mother argues that the trial justice erred in finding that she had a chronic substance-abuse problem, that her conduct was seriously detrimental to the children, that Bella and Cody would not be able to safely return to her care within a reasonable period of time, and that, therefore, she is an unfit parent under G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a). The father urges that the trial justice erred in determining, under the same statute, that he was unfit because the children had been in state custody for more than twelve months without a substantial probability of safe return to his care and because he had abandoned the children. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On September 16, 2010, the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) filed two petitions for the involuntary termination of respondents’ parental rights with respect to Bella and Cody. DCYF alleged the following: (1) that mother was unfit because of chronic substance', '-1- abuse that rendered her unlikely to be able to provide care for Bella and Cody within a reasonable period of time; (2) that the children had been in DCYF custody for at least twelve months and that both respondents were offered or received services but that there was not a substantial probability that the children would be able to safely return to either respondent’s care within a reasonable time period; (3) that both respondents had exhibited behavior or conduct seriously detrimental to the children of such a duration as to render it improbable that either respondent would be able to care for the children for an extended time period; and (4) that father had abandoned the children.', 'A trial on the petitions to terminate respondents’ parental rights was held before a justice of the Family Court over six days in May and June 2011. At trial, the Family Court heard testimony from two DCYF employees who had been involved in the case. The mother was present for one day of testimony and for the trial justice’s bench decision. The father did not appear for any portion of the trial. Neither respondent testified at trial.', 'Jane Johnson, a DCYF supervisor, testified that the case was assigned to her unit in June 2008 after DCYF received a call from the Warwick Police Department reporting a physical altercation between mother and one of her sisters. At that time, DCYF filed a petition alleging neglect against mother. 1 On July 17, 2008, Johnson visited mother at her cousin’s home, where she had been staying with the children. At that meeting Johnson talked to mother about enrolling in a substance-abuse and mental-health treatment program, and she scheduled a follow-up visit at which mother would sign the necessary release forms. However, when Johnson arrived for the follow-up visit, mother was not home. Ms. Johnson did, however, speak with mother on the telephone at that time about an upcoming court date and left a list of housing resources. 1', 'Ms. Johnson also noted that, according to the case history, Bella had been placed in DCYF care for approximately seven months during 2005.', '-2-', 'On July 28, 2008, DCYF received a call reporting that mother was residing with the children and a male friend in a basement boiler room that did not meet code standards and was going to be shut down. When Johnson followed up with mother about this report, mother explained that she had moved out of her cousin’s home temporarily because there was a “threat of head lice,” and she also reported that she was two months pregnant with a third child. During that conversation, mother agreed to undergo a substance-abuse evaluation. Then, on August 22, 2008, Johnson received information that mother was living in a tent in her cousin’s back yard, had been arrested for simple assault, and had been sent to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI). As a result, DCYF removed the children and placed them in nonrelative foster care, where they have since remained. 2', 'After the children were placed in foster care, mother had visitation with them but was required to call in advance to confirm visits because Bella became very upset when mother was late to or missed visits. In October 2008, Johnson met with mother to review her case plan. The goal of the case plan was reunification with the children and, per the plan, mother was to engage in mental-health treatment (including completing a psychological and parent-child evaluation), participate in a substance-abuse evaluation and follow-up services, and improve her financial stability by obtaining appropriate housing and utilizing community resources. However, mother refused to sign the case plan without an attorney present and conveyed that she was not interested in participating in substance-abuse treatment because she believed that “her only problem was housing.” Finally, Johnson testified that she had a conversation with mother in July 2009 during which she advised mother to participate in housing, substance-abuse, and mental- health programs because “time was running out for her in regards to her getting the children 2', 'Although Bella and Cody were initially placed separately, they currently reside together in a preadoptive foster home.', '-3- back.” During that meeting, mother reported that she had made an appointment with CODAC Behavioral Healthcare (CODAC), but Johnson testified that mother’s engagement with that organization was only “sporadic[].”', 'Tracey Bonang, the DCYF caseworker who was assigned to the case in September 2008, also testified at trial about mother’s progress towards her case-plan goals. With respect to the mental-health treatment component of the plan, Bonang reported that mother engaged in some services at the Halo Clinic, but was inconsistent about taking prescribed medications and did not complete a psychological and parent-child evaluation. The mother also participated in two substance-abuse programs, but completed neither. She did obtain housing for a short period of time, but was evicted. Throughout this period, mother had weekly visits with the children, but was not consistent and frequently arrived late.', 'In April 2009, when the first case plan expired, DCYF implemented a second case plan for mother, featuring many of the same objectives (mental-health treatment, substance-abuse treatment, and housing), again, with the goal of reunification. Although mother was accepted into a reunification program through Newport Child and Family Services that included housing and a variety of other services, she was unsuccessfully discharged from that program in August 2009. Ms. Bonang testified that had mother remained successfully engaged in the program, she would have been reunified with her children and would have received ongoing housing assistance.', 'Additionally, mother received services from CODAC during this period and eventually completed a psychological and parent-child evaluation with Dr. Brian Hayden. Doctor Hayden’s report identified a history of substance-abuse and mental-health issues and concluded that reunification was not likely unless mother “seriously address[ed] her mental health issues and', '-4- her tendency to abuse various substances.” Doctor Hayden also recommended that mother submit to random urine screens and complete a substance-abuse program to address what he described as a “strategy to cope [that is] highly correlated with substance abuse which is to rely on some pleasurable activity to distract one from dealing with a stressor.”', 'In the fall of 2009, mother successfully completed intensive inpatient substance-abuse treatment at the Kent Center.', 'During her subsequent participation in the Kent Center’s outpatient program, mother tested positive for alcohol and various psychiatric medications. Because mother was noncompliant with her appointments, she was terminated from that program in April 2010.', 'Also in the fall of 2009, Bonang prepared a third case plan for mother, again with tasks including obtaining mental-health and substance-abuse treatment and maintaining financial and housing stability. Ms. Bonang testified that, to her knowledge, mother never held a steady job during the period that the third case plan was in place. A fourth case plan eventually was implemented, and it featured the same basic set of tasks, as well as domestic-violence counseling; mother did not complete either those tasks or the domestic-violence counseling. The mother was hospitalized three times at Butler Hospital and, at the time of trial, was receiving some mental-health services. Ms. Bonang also noted that, at the time of trial, mother was homeless.', 'Ms. Bonang also testified regarding father’s involvement with DCYF. Initially, there was some dispute as to Cody’s paternity; but, in 2009, paternity testing established that he was, in fact, Cody’s father. Because father’s criminal background involved several domestic-violence arrests, his case plan required him to participate in mental-health and anger-management treatment. He successfully completed a program through Vantage Point, as well as a parent-', '-5- child evaluation. DCYF provided financial assistance to father to help him obtain appropriate housing.', 'Ms. Bonang also referred father to the Providence Children’s Museum Families Together Program, but he was twice terminated from that program. Since his second termination from that program in June 2010, father has not visited with either Bella or Cody. Ms. Bonang testified that, in September and October 2010, father was incarcerated in connection with a domestic-violence incident involving his then-girlfriend. Following father’s release from the ACI, he contacted Bonang several times about resuming visitation and scheduled appointments, but “missed quite a few of those appointments.” Ms. Bonang testified that “[b]ased on [father’s] lack of follow-through with many appointments * * * and based on the clinical recommendations of Isabella’s therapist,” the children’s guardian ad litem moved to suspend the children’s visitation with father in February 2011. 3 Ms. Bonang also acknowledged that father had never been accused of directly harming Bella or Cody.', 'Ms. Bonang testified that, at the time of trial, Bella and Cody were placed together in a nonrelative, preadoptive foster home. Additionally, she noted that Bella had struggled with numerous behavioral and mental-health problems and had been in counseling for roughly two years prior to trial. In particular, Bonang testified that Bella experienced anxiety related to visits with her father and that, after visits stopped in June 2010, DCYF had to increase the frequency of her mental-health services. 3', 'It is not clear from the case file whether the motion to suspend father’s visitation was granted, but, in their filings with this Court, the parties indicate that it was.', '-6-', 'At trial, each of the four case plans developed by DCYF for respondents was introduced into evidence as a full exhibit. 4 Additionally, Dr. Hayden’s evaluation of mother was entered as a full exhibit.', 'On June 23, 2011, the trial justice rendered his bench decision terminating respondents’ parental rights. The trial justice found by clear and convincing evidence that both children had been in the custody of DCYF for approximately twenty-eight months. Additionally, he found that both respondents were offered or received services from DCYF, which “were clearly delineated in the case plans that were presented to the [c]ourt * * *.”', 'The trial justice found that DCYF’s determinations regarding mother’s substance-abuse, mental-health, domestic-violence, and parenting-skills issues were “more than adequately supported by the evidence adduced at trial,” and he concluded that, notwithstanding “[v]arious case plans [that] were developed by the agency and presented to the mother[,] * * * [t]hroughout her involvement with DCYF [mother] displayed on numerous occasions a lack of cooperation and a chronic disregard of her parenting obligations.” In particular, the trial justice outlined a long list of services with which mother failed to follow through and noted that “[s]ince August 2009 she has demonstrated a lack of cooperation with the DCYF social worker and failed to appear for numerous appointments to address the situation and conditions which led to the children coming into the care of the State.” Finally, he observed that mother failed to make progress toward completing any of the three primary tasks outlined in all of her case plans— obtaining mental-health treatment, substance-abuse treatment, and stable housing. Therefore, the trial justice found “by clear and convincing evidence that the [mother] is unfit by reason of 4', 'Although separate case plans were developed for Cody and Bella, it appears that only Cody’s were introduced into evidence. However, a review of the record indicates that Cody’s and Bella’s case plans were substantially similar in all material respects.', '-7- conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to these children.” Additionally, he found that mother “has a chronic substance abuse problem,” and he concluded that, notwithstanding DCYF’s efforts to engage mother in various substance-abuse programs, her “prognosis indicates that the children will not be able to return * * * to her custody within a reasonable period of time considering these children’s tender years and their need for a permanent home.”', 'With respect to father, the trial justice found that, although he completed an anger- management course, he did not successfully complete the Families Together Program as was required by his case plan. Additionally, the trial justice noted that DCYF provided rental assistance to father when it appeared that reunification with the children might be possible. The trial justice also found, however, that father had not visited with the children since June 26, 2010 (nearly one year) and had not had “meaningful contact” with the DCYF worker for more than fourteen months. Therefore, the trial justice found by clear and convincing evidence that father “ha[d] exhibited by his conduct an utter and willful disregard for his children by abandoning and deserting them” and that, therefore, he was an unfit parent.', 'Additionally, the trial justice noted that the children “are both placed together in a pre- adoptive home and are doing well. The foster family has expressed to the DCYF a willingness to be a permanent family for the children.” The trial justice therefore terminated both respondents’ parental rights. On June 30, 2011, the trial justice entered a termination of parental rights decree outlining his findings of fact. Both respondents timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing a decision terminating parental rights, “we remain keenly mindful that natural parents have a ‘fundamental liberty interest’ in the care, custody, and management of', '-8- their children.” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1154 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982)). Therefore, “[i]n order to permanently sever the rights of a parent in his or her children, the trial justice must make a determination that the parent is unfit” and “[t]he state must prove parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence in order to satisfy the parent’s right to due process.” In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d 159, 165 (R.I. 2009). The trial justice’s findings are entitled to significant weight, and we will not overturn them unless they are “clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Id. (quoting In re David L., 877 A.2d 667, 671 (R.I. 2005)). However, “[u]pon a determination of parental unfitness, the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” In re Dayvon G., 10 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Brook Ann R., 994 A.2d 1241, 1244 (R.I. 2010)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Section 15-7-7(a) 5 sets forth several specific grounds upon which the Family Court may base a termination of parental rights, and it is apparent that the trial justice relied on several of 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a) provides, in pertinent part:', '“The court shall * * * terminate any and all legal rights of the', 'parent to the child * * * if the court finds as a fact by clear and', 'convincing evidence that:', '“* * *', '“(2) The parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions', 'seriously detrimental to the child; such as, but not limited to, the', 'following:', '“* * *', '“(iii) The child has been placed in the legal custody or care', 'of [DCYF] and the parent has a chronic substance abuse problem', 'and the parent’s prognosis indicates that the child will not be able', '-9- these statutory provisions in reaching his conclusion in this case. In his decree, the trial justice concluded that there was a sufficient basis to terminate both respondents’ parental rights under § 15-7-7(a)(3) because the children had been in DCYF custody for at least twelve months, both parents were offered and received services to rectify the situation that led to DCYF placement, and it was not substantially probable that the children would return to either parent’s care within a reasonable period. Additionally, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii), the trial justice found by clear and convincing evidence that mother was unfit because the children had been in DCYF custody, mother had a chronic substance-abuse problem, and mother’s prognosis indicated that the children would not return to her care within a reasonable time. He also concluded, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii), that mother was unfit because she had “exhibited behavior or conduct that is', 'to return to the custody of the parent within a reasonable period of', 'time, considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent', 'home.

The respondents take issue with each of these conclusions. We shall address the arguments of each respondent separately.', 'A', 'Mother', 'On appeal, mother disputes several of the Family Court’s factual findings underpinning each of its three grounds for terminating her parental rights. We begin by addressing her argument that the trial justice erroneously terminated her parental rights pursuant to § 15-7- 7(a)(3), which provides that a parent may be found unfit if', '“[t]he child has been placed in the legal custody or care of [DCYF]', 'for at least twelve (12) months, and the parents were offered or', 'received services to correct the situation which led to the child', 'being placed; provided, that there is not a substantial probability', 'that the child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care', 'within a reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and', 'need for a permanent home[.]” The mother contends that the trial justice misconceived and overlooked material evidence in finding that the children’s return to her home within a reasonable period was improbable and was clearly wrong in reaching that conclusion. In particular, mother objects to the trial justice’s findings regarding her consistent failure to follow through on mental-health and substance-abuse treatment, her unsuccessful discharges from substance-abuse treatment programs, and her absence from or tardiness to appointments with her DCYF caseworker and visits with her children. She notes that she did eventually complete a psychological evaluation with Dr. Hayden and successfully engaged in some mental-health and substance-abuse treatment. Additionally,', '- 11 - she contends that, although she missed one early meeting with her caseworker and was sometimes late to visits, she did not miss visits with her children.', 'In response, DCYF points out that the trial justice specifically found that mother “displayed on numerous occasions a lack of cooperation and a chronic disregard of her parenting obligations” and points to several substance-abuse, mental-health, and housing programs that mother failed to successfully complete. The guardian ad litem adds that DCYF made a number of referrals to various service agencies to assist mother with her mental-health, substance-abuse, and housing issues, but that she has been persistently unwilling to cooperate with services.', 'Although mother offers various excuses and justifications for specific shortcomings and failures, we are of the opinion that, when taken as a whole, the record reveals that mother made little progress toward completing the tasks and goals outlined in the four case plans developed for her by DCYF; and, accordingly, we do not conclude that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or that he was clearly wrong in making his findings.', 'In particular, we observe that the uncontroverted testimony of two DCYF workers demonstrates that, although mother occasionally and sporadically engaged in select services, she generally failed to follow through with the majority of the services to which she was referred. Additionally, Tracey Bonang testified that mother had been homeless for most of the two-and-a- half-year period preceding trial. Under these circumstances, we will not disturb the finding of the trial justice that there was no “substantial probability that the child[ren] will be able to return safely to the [mother’s] care within a reasonable period of time considering [their] age and the need for a permanent home.” Section 15-7-7(a)(3).', 'The mother also takes issue with the trial justice’s findings that she was unfit under § 15- 7-7(a)(2)(iii) and (a)(2)(vii). However, because we have already concluded that the trial justice', '- 12 - did not err in finding mother unfit pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(3), we need not address these additional grounds for termination of her parental rights.', 'B', 'Father', 'Next, we turn to father’s claims of error concerning the Family Court’s findings. He argues that the trial justice erred both in terminating his parental rights after finding that there was no substantial likelihood that the children would return to his care within a reasonable time period and that he had abandoned or deserted the children.', 'We address father’s second argument first. Section 15-7-7(a)(4) provides that a court shall terminate parental rights upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that “[t]he parent has abandoned or deserted the child,” and it further specifies that “[a] lack of communication or contact with the child for at least a six (6) month period shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment or desertion.”', 'The trial justice specifically found, based on Bonang’s uncontroverted testimony, that father had not visited with his children for nearly one year prior to trial. The father acknowledges that the presumptive six-month period for abandonment was established in this case, but he argues that he continued to make efforts to maintain contact and was “[l]egally [p]revented” from doing so when his visitation rights were suspended.', 'In particular, father avers that the trial justice overlooked the fact “that [he] contacted the worker in the late fall of 2010, following his release from jail, and again in the spring of 2011, even after his visitation was suspended.” He also points out that we have previously held that a parent’s good-faith efforts to visit with his or her children may overcome the statutory presumption of abandonment after six months of no contact, and he urges that we apply that case law here. See In re Angelina T., 996 A.2d 623, 627 (R.I. 2010) (concluding that when a father’s repeated', '- 13 - attempts to establish visitation with his daughter were denied by the Family Court, he had not abandoned his daughter even though the six-month statutory period of no contact was met).', 'DCYF and the guardian ad litem respond that father’s visitation rights were not suspended until well after the six-month period had lapsed, and they maintain that father failed to rebut the statutory presumption of abandonment. DCYF further asserts that there is no legal basis for father’s argument that the court erred in finding abandonment because he was “legally prevented” from contacting his children, and it notes that this Court has upheld the finding of abandonment even where there was not a complete lack of contact for the requisite period. See In re Danesha J., 889 A.2d 230, 231 (R.I. 2006) (mem.) (“The lack of visits or contact need not be total; rather, as this Court has held, the parent has an affirmative obligation to maintain substantial and repeated contact with the child, and he or she must demonstrate consistent interest in or concern for the child.”).', 'Here, the uncontroverted testimony at trial demonstrates that, following his visit with the children in June 2010, the father had no additional contact with his children and that, despite some attempts to meet with the DCYF caseworker in late 2010 and early 2011, he missed or canceled several appointments, and visitation never actually resumed. The facts presented here are markedly different from those in In re Angelina T., 996 A.2d at 627, because there the father filed various motions with the Family Court seeking to establish visitation and completed several programs upon the request of DCYF in an effort to establish a relationship with his daughter. By contrast, here contact between the father and his children ceased completely after he was terminated from the Families Together Program in June 2010, and the uncontroverted testimony of the DCYF worker indicates that he did not resume contact with DCYF until late in 2010 or early in 2011, and, even then, missed or canceled his appointments with her. We therefore', '- 14 - conclude that the trial justice did not err in finding, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(4), that the father had abandoned his children. Finally, because we conclude that the trial justice properly found abandonment in this case, we need not address the father’s argument regarding termination of his parental rights under § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court terminating the respondents’ parental rights.

34,"Jaime Carreiro : v. : David Tobin, Alias et al. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, Jaime Carreiro (plaintiff), appeals from the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, David Tobin (defendant). 1 Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the trial justice erred in finding that the dog bite at issue occurred within the enclosure of the owner or keeper of the dog. Further, the plaintiff avers that the apartment in which the incident took place is an entirely separate apartment within the defendant’s building and that, therefore, the presence of the dog outside the defendant’s enclosure is sufficient to impose strict liability on the defendant for injuries resulting from the bite. On April 4, 2013, this case came before the Supreme Court, sitting at Exeter-West Greenwich High School in the Town of West Greenwich. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Another defendant, Caitlin Regan, was dismissed from the case by stipulation of the parties on January 23, 2013.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On the afternoon of December 16, 2007, plaintiff visited his friends Kevin and Kyle Regan 2 to watch a football game, together with friends Matthew Martel and “Stephen,” 3 as the men had done on several previous Sundays. The Regan brothers lived in the second-floor apartment of a two-family house at 4 Colonial Drive in the Town of North Providence. The house is owned by defendant, who lives in the first-floor apartment. Kyle and Kevin’s mother, Wendy Regan, lives with defendant in the first-floor apartment. Neither defendant nor Wendy was home at the time of the incident.', 'The plaintiff stated at deposition that he had visited the home before, and had previously met Kyle and Kevin’s sister, Caitlin Regan, 4 and her sixty-five-pound pit bull, Angus. Mr. Carreiro recalled meeting Angus “[o]nce or twice briefly,” and he thought that one such occasion took place “at the Tobin residence.” Mr. Carreiro stated that he knew Caitlin had owned the dog for a few years and he had never noticed any problem with Angus’s behavior. On the afternoon of December 16, Caitlin was not in attendance, but Angus was in the unlocked first-floor apartment. Precisely when and how Angus arrived at the Tobin residence is a gnawing question.', 'Further, whether Caitlin lived in the first-floor apartment with her mother and defendant is a matter of dispute. The defendant and Wendy stated that Caitlin did not live with them. The defendant said that Caitlin had previously shared the upstairs apartment with her brother, Kevin, but that she lived in South County at the time of the incident. There is no testimony from Kyle 2', 'Because there are several members of the Regan family referenced in this opinion, we will refer to them by their first names. No disrespect is intended. 3', 'Stephen’s last name is unknown. 4', 'Ms. Regan is variously referred to in the record as Katy, Katie, Caitlin, and Kathryn. We will rely on Ms. Regan’s signature within the record as authoritative and thus will refer to her as Caitlin.', '-2- or Kevin in the record. Martel stated that Caitlin lived in the first-floor apartment, but he did not provide the basis for his knowledge. The plaintiff stated that Caitlin was staying in the first-floor apartment “temporarily,” but he also did not state his basis for this belief. In her answer to plaintiff’s complaint, Caitlin indicated that she did not reside in the first-floor apartment at the time of the incident. There is no statement from Caitlin in the record, and no one witnessed her dropping off the dog. The police report regarding the incident identifies “Katie Regan” as the owner of the dog, and it lists her address as “4 Colonial Dr.” but does not include an apartment number.', 'In any event, at some point in the afternoon, someone fetched Angus from defendant’s apartment and brought the dog upstairs, where it visited for a time before being taken back downstairs. The plaintiff stated that “[i]t had to have been” either Kyle or Kevin who brought the dog into the second-floor apartment. This first visit was short and uneventful. Later that afternoon, Stephen retrieved the dog for a second visit, and Angus made his rounds “checking everyone out” before approaching plaintiff. Mr. Carreiro reported that the dog “seemed fine.” He petted the dog as Angus sniffed him, but Carreiro further testified that, when he turned his head, the dog “just snapped at me. He took one bite and then ran.” The plaintiff then went to St. Joseph’s/Fatima Hospital, where he received stitches to close the wound he received from the dog bite.', 'On March 24, 2008, plaintiff filed suit in Superior Court against “Katie Regan” and defendant, alleging that Caitlin’s dog “had hostile and vicious tendencies” and that, “as a direct and proximate result of [d]efendants’ negligence, [p]laintiff was caused to sustain severe personal injuries.” 5 In August 2011, defendants moved for summary judgment. At a hearing on 5', 'The complaint was later amended to correct Caitlin’s name.', '-3- October 18, 2011, the Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The plaintiff timely appealed. In January 2013, Caitlin Regan was dismissed from the suit, by agreement.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment “de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Great American E & S Insurance Co. v. End Zone Pub & Grill of Narragansett, Inc., 45 A.3d 571, 574 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Generation Realty, LLC v. Catanzaro, 21 A.3d 253, 258 (R.I. 2011)). “[S]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Arbella Protection Insurance Co., 24 A.3d 544, 553 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 390 (R.I. 2008)). “We will affirm a lower court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Great American E & S Insurance Co., 45 A.3d at 574 (quoting Generation Realty, LLC, 21 A.3d at 258).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Liability for acts of canine aggression is well settled in Rhode Island. For injuries suffered within a dog owner’s “enclosure,” we adhere to the common-law rule requiring “that the plaintiff first must prove that the defendant knew about the dog’s vicious propensities, a scienter requirement commonly referred to as the ‘one-bite rule.’” DuBois v. Quilitzsch, 21 A.3d 375, 380 (R.I. 2011). Since 1889, however, statutory law has imposed strict liability where the dog', '-4- bite occurs outside the owner or keeper’s enclosure. See Bernhart v. Nine, 120 R.I. 692, 694-95, 391 A.2d 75, 76-77 (1978). General Laws 1956 § 4-13-16 provides that, if a dog “assaults, bites, or otherwise injures any person while traveling the highway or out of the enclosure of the owner or keeper of that dog, the owner or keeper of the dog shall be liable to the person aggrieved, for all damage sustained * * * .” Additionally, liability for damages done by any dog extends to “[a]ny person keeping or harboring [the dog] in his or her house or on his or her lands * * *.” Section 4-13-17. Precisely where the dog bite took place, then, can be outcome-determinative.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the second-floor apartment was a separate enclosure for purposes of § 4-13-16. Because the bite occurred in a distinct private residence, rather than within the first-floor apartment, yard, or common areas of defendant’s house, plaintiff asserts that the dog was outside the enclosure of the owner or keeper and that, therefore, there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether defendant is strictly liable. The defendant responds that the purpose of an enclosure, under § 4-13-16, is to put a person on notice that he or she is entering a premises where there might be a dog present. Because plaintiff was already aware that the dog was present within an enclosed space, defendant argues, it is immaterial whether the dog was within a separate apartment when the bite occurred and as such there would be no liability absent evidence of knowledge of the dog’s prior vicious tendencies. 6 The central question is, then, what is meant by the term “enclosure of the owner or keeper” as set forth in § 4-13-16.', 'Fortunately, while there is no case that is completely on all fours with this one, there is a dog-eared decision from 1936 that gives us clear guidance. In Wilbur v. Gross, 55 R.I. 473, 477, 6', 'The plaintiff conceded that “It’s not a negligence issue. The evidence is clear. There’s no real testimony that there’s any knowledge of any of the owners that the dog had violent or dangerous or vicious propensity.”', '-5- 182 A. 597, 599 (1936), this Court conducted an extensive exploration of the meaning of enclosure under the statute and determined that “the important thing under [the statute] is that there be something to give a man reasonable notice that he is entering upon occupied premises, where there may be a dog.” We held that no “restraining obstructions” were required because the “land need not be surrounded by barriers of a sort to keep dogs in, if they wish to go through them, and * * * the degree of care exercised by the owner to keep his dog inside his premises has no bearing on the question of his legal liability.” Id. at 479, 182 A. at 600. Rather, “the nature of the owner’s liability [is] dependent upon whether or not the injured man did or did not have reasonable notice that he was entering within the boundaries of occupied land, where a dog might be kept by the occupant.” Id. at 480, 182 A. at 600.', 'In the decades since Wilbur, we have continued to apply that definition, unaltered, in claims arising under § 4-13-16. See, e.g., Montiero v. Silver Lake I, L.P., 813 A.2d 978, 979 & n.1, 981 (R.I. 2003) (holding that a landlord could not be held liable for injuries resulting from a dog bite on its premises when there was no evidence to suggest that the landlord knew of the dog’s dangerous propensities); Lamoureux v. Davis, 504 A.2d 449, 451 (R.I. 1986) (holding that a poorly marked enclosure was not sufficient to put a person on notice that he or she was entering onto occupied premises where a dog might be present); Bernhart, 120 R.I. at 699, 391 A.2d at 78 (stating that “a visitor making his way onto the [defendant’s] property should have noticed that he was about to enter premises on which he might be confronted with a curious, if not cantankerous dog”).', 'We have held that the intent of the enclosure requirement “is not to keep the dog inside the occupied premises but to keep persons outside, unless they are willing to assume the risk of being injured, while on the occupied premises, by a dog which is there kept and which the', '-6- occupant reasonably believes to be gentle.” Wilbur, 55 R.I. at 481, 182 A. at 601. Here, plaintiff was clearly on notice that he was on occupied premises on which there might be a dog. He had previously met Angus, and thought that he had seen the dog once before at the Tobin residence. He had encountered the dog earlier that afternoon, without incident. He could not, therefore, be surprised to meet Angus again on his later visit. The plaintiff conceded that there was no indication that defendant knew Angus to be vicious, and plaintiff himself had never noticed any problem with the dog.', 'The plaintiff urges us, however, to consider the second-floor apartment an entirely separate enclosure from defendant’s first-floor apartment. To support this argument, plaintiff points out that Kyle and Kevin paid rent and that the second-floor apartment was accessed by a separate side entrance. Although plaintiff asserts that defendant had “no legal right [to be] inside the Regans’ apartment unless specific permission [wa]s granted,” there is no evidence in the record regarding whether the door to the second-floor apartment was locked or even kept closed, or whether defendant or the dog had permission to come and go at will. The defendant testified at deposition that both the first- and second-floor apartments were accessible from the same side entrance, that he regularly left the door to his first-floor apartment unlocked, and that the brothers were “always welcome to come in.” Absent an inquiry into whether the second-floor apartment was kept locked and whether defendant was excluded from the premises, it is impossible to determine whether the second-floor apartment was a separate enclosure within defendant’s house. This remains a disputed question of material fact that must be determined by a trier of fact.', 'Assuming, arguendo, that the second-floor apartment was a wholly separate enclosure, to hold defendant strictly liable, plaintiff must also prove that defendant was the “owner or keeper”', '-7- of the dog that bit him while outside defendant’s enclosure. Section 4-13-16. There is no dispute that Caitlin was the owner of the dog, but there is no definition of the term “keeper” within our case law. Presumably, if the dog were in defendant’s first-floor apartment with his permission, defendant would be the keeper. While there is no dispute that the dog, at some point, arrived in the first-floor apartment, it is unclear whether the dog was there with defendant’s knowledge or permission, tacit or otherwise. As noted previously, § 4-13-17 imposes the same liability of an owner upon “[a]ny person keeping or harboring * * * [a] dog, or knowingly suffering this to be done by any other person * * *.” Thus, plaintiff must also show that defendant knew of or permitted Angus’s presence on his premises. See Montiero, 813 A.2d at 981 (“The first step in imposing liability under [§ 4-13-17] is to establish that the keeper or harborer knew of the dog’s presence on the premises.”).', 'Finally, strict liability may not rest solely on the fact that, for some portion of December 16, 2007, the dog stayed in the defendant’s first-floor apartment. There is no evidence in the record that the defendant exercised any control over the dog. Given that the defendant was absent from the premises when the dog was taken out of the first-floor apartment and brought into Kyle and Kevin’s second-floor apartment, it seems likely that Kyle and Kevin exerted control over the dog at the time of the incident and, as such, they rather than the defendant were Angus’s keepers. We conclude that these disputed issues must be resolved by a trier of fact and are not suitable for summary disposition.', '-8-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

Joyce Wheeler (plaintiff or Wheeler) appeals from a Superior Court order granting in part and denying in part her motion to confirm an arbitration award against Encompass Insurance Company (defendant or Encompass). For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the order and direct that the arbitration award be reinstated in its entirety.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts and travel of this case are not in dispute. On October 19, 2007, plaintiff was injured in a motor-vehicle collision with an underinsured driver (tortfeasor). The tortfeasor was insured by Progressive Insurance Company (Progressive) with a $25,000 liability limit for bodily injury. Progressive did not contest liability and paid plaintiff the policy limits. The plaintiff then sought recovery for personal injuries pursuant to the uninsured/underinsured motorist provisions (UM/UIM coverage) of her Encompass policy. That policy provided UM/UIM coverage up to $100,000.', 'Because Encompass contested the nature and extent of plaintiff‘s injuries—apparently', '-1- based on her refusal of treatment at the scene and a one-week delay in seeking medical treatment—the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators.1 The arbitrators found that plaintiff‘s damages amounted to $150,000 and, further, that the tortfeasor had paid $25,000 of those damages and defendant had paid $5,000 pursuant to the Medical Payment provision of plaintiff‘s policy. The arbitrators concluded that plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest on the $25,000 tortfeasor payment until the date it was paid and on the outstanding $120,000 in damages.

The defendant argues that, under Rhode Island law, plaintiff was not entitled to recover any amounts from Encompass in excess of her policy limits. Accordingly, defendant objected to that portion of the arbitration award that purported to declare defendant liable for damages that she was not legally entitled to recover from Encompass.', 'The Superior Court considered the petition and the objection thereto at a May 26, 2011 hearing. Counsel for plaintiff argued that arbitrators are free to render an award in excess of policy limits against an insurer in circumstances in which they are asked to determine an insured‘s damages vis-à-vis the insurer and, according to plaintiff, this precisely is the issue posed to the panel of arbitrators in this case. See Allstate Insurance Co. v. Lombardi, 773 A.2d 864, 870 n.2 (R.I. 2001) (―[W]hen the arbitrators have been asked to determine the amount that the injured parties are entitled to recover from the UIM insurer, then the arbitrators can award prejudgment interest in excess of the policy limits.‖ citing Allstate Insurance Co. v. Pogorilich, 605 A.2d 1318, 1321 (R.I. 1992)). Encompass, on the other hand, alleged that the arbitration in this case was entered into strictly in accordance with the terms of the insurance policy. According to Encompass, this was not litigation between Wheeler and Encompass and, to that end, plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages in excess of the limits of her insurance policy.', 'After hearing from both parties, the trial justice issued a bench decision. In so doing, he determined that the matter was controlled by Pogorilich. In that case, this Court determined that ―[a]n uninsured/underinsured motorist policy limit may not be expanded to include prejudgment interest even though the injured party may be entitled to recover such prejudgment interest from 4', 'Although entitled ―Defendant Encompass Insurance‘s Limited Opposition‖ to the petition to confirm the award, we consider this pleading an objection to the petition.', '-3- the tortfeasor.‖ Pogorilich, 605 A.2d at 1321. Further, the trial justice concluded that the remaining cases cited by the parties were distinguishable from the case before him.5 Therefore, the trial justice ―sustain[ed] the objection to the petition to confirm to the extent that the award exceeds the policy,‖ but he confirmed the award ―in all other respects.‖ An order entered that modified the award of the arbitrators; it vacated that portion of the award that was in excess of the $100,000 policy limit and confirmed the remainder of the arbitration award. Specifically, the order stated that the petition to confirm the award was denied ―to the extent that the Arbitration Award exceeds the applicable insurance policy limits of $100,000‖ and, ―[t]o the extent that the Award purports to award the Plaintiff any amount in excess of the policy limits of $100,000, that portion of the Award is hereby vacated.‖ The plaintiff appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'Judicial review of arbitration awards is ―statutorily prescribed and is limited in nature.‖ Buttie v.

See Lombardi, 773 A.2d at 870 (―Allstate may not obtain relief from [this] judgment merely because the Superior Court may have committed a legal error on the merits when it entered that judgment.‖).

We are convinced that the trial justice‘s decision had the practical effect of modifying the award. Section 10-3-14(a) unambiguously directs the courts to modify an award—―upon the application of any party‖—only in limited circumstances. Neither party filed a motion to modify this award. However, Encompass did file an objection to plaintiff‘s petition to confirm the award. Therefore, before we address whether the trial justice‘s', '-6- modification of the award was proper, we first must determine whether Encompass‘s objection to plaintiff‘s petition to confirm satisfied the ―application‖ component of § 10-3-14(a) necessary to trigger the modification inquiry. We conclude that it did.', 'Our decision in City of East Providence v. United Steelworkers of America, Local 15509, 925 A.2d 246, 253-55 (R.I. 2007), guides us in our inquiry. In that case, the union filed a motion to confirm an arbitration award; the city filed both a motion to vacate the award and an objection to the union‘s motion to confirm. Id. at 251. After the trial justice vacated the award, the union appealed, arguing that the city‘s motion to vacate was improper because it violated the waiver- of-appeals clause in the parties‘ collective bargaining agreement.

As is pertinent here,', '-7- review of the award, and Encompass‘s objection provided sufficient grounds to warrant a continuation of the inquiry that plaintiff‘s petition to confirm set in motion. Therefore, we must squarely address the merits of the trial justice‘s modification of the arbitration award.', 'II', 'Turning to the merits, we are convinced that the trial justice erred in modifying the arbitration award.', 'Modification of an arbitration award is permitted only in limited circumstances:', '―[T]he court must make an order modifying or correcting the', 'award, upon the application of any party to the arbitration:', '―(1) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of', 'figures, or an evident material mistake in the description of any', 'person, thing, or property referred to in the award.', '―(2) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not', 'submitted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of', 'the decision upon the matters submitted.', '―(3) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not', 'affecting the merits of the controversy.‖ Section 10-3-14(a).

Before this Court, the parties agreed that they did not submit a specific question or frame the issue for the panel; they also agreed that the insurance policy was not introduced for the arbitrators‘ consideration.7 We do, however, have before us a carefully crafted award calculating the amount of prejudgment interest in accordance with this Court‘s holding in Barry, 892 A.2d at 923-24.', 'In modifying this award, the trial justice accepted defendant‘s contention that, in accordance with Pogorilich, arbitrators may not award prejudgment interest above policy limits. See Pogorilich, 605 A.2d at 1321. In effect, then, the trial justice modified the award based on his belief that the arbitrators had made an error of law. However, it is settled beyond a hint of contradiction that a mistake of law is not grounds for upsetting an arbitration award. See Aponik, 844 A.2d at 704; Purvis Systems, Inc., 788 A.2d at 1115; see also Westminster Construction Corp. v.

Therefore, this was not an appropriate ground on which the trial justice could modify the arbitration award.', 'After reviewing the record in this case, including with particularity the transcript of the 7', 'The dissent faults the arbitrators and the majority for declining to apply the provisions of the insurance policy to the issues in this case. What is abundantly clear in this case is that neither a precise question nor the insurance policy was submitted to the arbitration panel. We are unwilling to vacate an arbitration award on the basis of an insurance policy that was not in evidence. Moreover, we decline to engage in the type of de novo review conducted by the dissent.', '-9- hearing, we can reach no other conclusion than that the hearing justice applied a de novo standard of review to the panel‘s award, decided that the panel had been incorrect in its application of the law, and modified the award to conform with the court‘s interpretation of the law. This, in our view, was error. Such a plenary review of an arbitration award cannot be countenanced in light of the carefully crafted and strictly circumscribed role of the judiciary under chapter 3 of title 10.8 Because no grounds for modification or vacation of the award existed, the trial justice was obligated to confirm it.9 8', 'We pause to note that the award was not affected by an error of law in the first place. The trial justice‘s mistaken reading of Lombardi led him to the conclusion that the panel committed an error of law. See footnote 5, supra. However, in Lombardi, 773 A.2d at 870 n.2, we made clear that', '―this Court‘s ruling in [Pogorilich] does not stand for the proposition that an', 'arbitration award cannot include prejudgment interest in excess of the limits of an', 'insured‘s uninsured motorist (UIM) coverage.

But when the arbitrators have been asked to determine the amount that', 'the injured parties are entitled to recover from the UIM insurer, then the', 'arbitrators can award prejudgment interest in excess of the policy limits.‖ See also Sentry Insurance Co. v.

Thus, we are satisfied that the arbitration panel was free to frame the issue before it. We deem it telling that the arbitrators carefully and correctly adhered to the formula promulgated by this Court in Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 923-24 (R.I. 2006). The panel‘s prejudgment interest computations were made from the prism of insurer liability, as Barry directs. 9', 'The plaintiff also has alleged that Encompass breached the insurance contract and acted in bad faith.

I believe that the majority‘s analysis fails to deal with a critical fact—viz., that there is no evidence in the record that the parties ever agreed to submit to arbitration either (1) the issue of Encompass‘s liability to Ms. Wheeler or (2) the issue of whether or not the insurance policy limits could be disregarded. Therefore, I believe that the trial court correctly modified the award by focusing on the only piece of the award related to a properly arbitrable issue (viz., the panel‘s determination of the amount of damages suffered by', '- 11 - Ms. Wheeler as a result of the tortfeasor‘s actions) and then looking to Ms. Wheeler‘s policy limits (viz., $100,000) in order to determine Encompass‘s appropriate contractual liability.', 'Analysis', 'In Rhode Island, ―[a]rbitration is a creature of the contract between the parties * * *.‖ State Department of Corrections v.

See Bush, 448 A.2d at 784 (―[A] party is bound only to arbitrate those issues that he [or she] has consented to arbitrate.‖). The only evidence in this case regarding any agreement to arbitrate is the highly specific arbitration provision contained in the insurance policy. Indeed, Ms. Wheeler‘s appellate brief concedes this much, noting that the parties went to arbitration ―[p]ursuant to the provisions of the insurance policy.‖', '- 12 -', 'The arbitration clause in section b.1 of that insurance policy reads as follows:', '―1.

As Ms. Wheeler states in her appellate brief, Encompass did not ―question [the tortfeasor‘s] liability in this matter‖; accordingly, subsection (a) of the above-quoted policy language did not apply.

The final paragraph of the award, however, goes on to decide', '- 13 - Encompass‘s contractual liability—even though there is absolutely no evidence that the parties ever agreed to arbitrate that issue. Rather, it is clear from the language of the insurance policy that the only issue that could be arbitrated was the amount of damages which Ms. Wheeler could recover from the tortfeasor. Further, by awarding $172,750 to Ms. Wheeler from her insurer, the award also decides that the $100,000 policy limits do not apply. Again, there is absolutely no evidence that the parties ever agreed to arbitrate any issue regarding the policy limits.', 'To the extent that the arbitration panel‘s award decided issues beyond the discrete issues referenced in the insurance policy‘s arbitration clause, the arbitration panel issued an award ―upon a matter not submitted to them.‖ See § 10-3-14(a)(2). The trial court therefore was required by statute to ―modify and correct the award, so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.‖ See § 10-3-14(b). That is exactly what the trial court in this case did; focusing on the language of the insurance policy, it properly modified the award to reflect the insurance policy‘s clear $100,000 policy limits—the amount of insurance coverage that Ms. Wheeler had paid for.', 'By requiring the Superior Court to confirm the award, the majority is in effect ignoring the parties‘ express written agreement according to which just two issues were potentially appropriate for arbitration (only one of which is relevant to this case). The Court is approving a financial windfall for Ms. Wheeler; she paid policy premiums that would entitle her to up to $100,000 of coverage, yet the majority is allowing her to collect $172,750.10 The majority reaches this conclusion even though we have held that ―in no event‖ may a plaintiff‘s recovery under his or her own underinsured motorist policy exceed the limits of that policy‘s coverage. See Archambault v. Federal Insurance Co., 690 A.2d 1348, 1350 (R.I. 1997) (emphasis added). 10', 'Encompass promptly paid Ms. Wheeler the $100,000 policy limits after the arbitration award was issued.', '- 14 -', 'I agree with the majority opinion that ―there is no record of the arbitration proceeding that gave rise to [the arbitration] award, nor is there any evidence establishing the question that was submitted to the arbitration panel.‖ I also acknowledge, along with the majority, that ―the parties agreed that they did not submit a specific question or frame the issue for the panel.‖ However, I disagree with that opinion‘s reliance on the absence of a record as a predicate for the conclusion that ―the arbitration panel was free to frame the issue before it.‖ I believe that their conclusion is patently wrong because the majority fails to address a threshold issue: What in the record authorized the arbitration panel to decide Encompass‘s liability or any issue regarding policy limits?11', 'As mentioned above, an arbitration panel ―derives [its] jurisdiction from a mutual agreement of the parties to submit the matter to arbitration.‖ See Blackstone Valley Gas & Electric Co., 64 R.I. at 223, 12 A.2d at 749 (emphasis added). The record does not contain a shred of evidence that the arbitration panel had the authority to decide (1) Encompass‘s liability 11', 'The majority opinion cites to Purvis Systems, Inc. v. American Systems Corp., 788 A.2d 1112, 1116 (R.I. 2002), in support of the proposition that the arbitration panel was ―free to frame the issue before it.‖ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The opinion in that case states: ―As long as the agreement to arbitrate is valid and the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable, the arbitrator may frame the issues to be decided.‖ Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Again, the majority fails to address the threshold issue. There is no evidence in this case that ―the subject matter of the dispute [(viz., the issues regarding policy limits and Encompass‘s contractual liability)] [was] arbitrable.‖ See id. (internal quotation marks omitted). In Purvis, the arbitration clause was broad, providing that ―[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or related to [the] contract or breach thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration.‖ Id. at 1115 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The panel therefore had the authority to frame the issues within that broad arbitration clause. Likewise, the majority‘s analysis might be correct if Encompass and Ms. Wheeler had agreed to arbitrate any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the insurance policy. In stark contrast, however, the arbitration clause in the case before us is as precise as it is narrow; it clearly indicates that the only arbitrable subject matter was the amount of damages that Ms. Wheeler could recover from the tortfeasor. There is no evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate other issues. It ineluctably follows that the arbitration panel had absolutely no authority to ―frame the issues‖ outside of the particular issue mentioned in the arbitration clause.', '- 15 - or (2) the issue of whether or not the policy limits should apply. Absent evidence of some supplementary agreement, the arbitration panel12 was ―powerless‖ to decide those two issues.

Turco, 574 A.2d 143, 147 (R.I. 1990) (stating that an arbitrator ―[does] not have the power and authority to rewrite [a contract]‖). An arbitration panel is not ―free to frame the issue before it‖ when the evidence shows that the parties agreed to arbitrate only discrete issues, as is the case here.', 'In 2005, the Utah Supreme Court addressed a case with a strikingly similar fact pattern. See Allstate Insurance Co. v. Wong, 122 P.3d 589 (Utah 2005). An automobile insurer filed a motion to vacate or modify an arbitrator‘s award of underinsured motorist benefits where the award exceeded the policy limits. Id. at 592. Just as in the case before us, the parties had agreed to arbitrate the insured‘s damages—not the insurer‘s liability. See id. Additionally, just as in the case before us, the arbitrators were never informed of the policy limits. See id. The Utah Supreme Court unanimously recognized that the arbitration panel went beyond its authority when it issued an award that (1) determined the insurer‘s liability (as opposed to the insured‘s damages) and (2) exceeded policy limits:', '―By the terms of [the arbitration] agreement, the parties agreed to', 'submit the issue of [the insured‘s] damages to arbitration. The', 'parties did not submit to arbitration the issue of [the insurer‘s]', 'liability to [the insured]. * * * In fact, there is no language in the', '[arbitration agreements] that would operate to invalidate or', 'otherwise modify the mutual obligations contained in the parties‘', 'insurance contract.

It was an early evening in May when an armed gunman in a hooded sweatshirt approached her in front of 95 Congress Avenue in Providence. He shot her several times at close range. She was rushed to Rhode Island Hospital, where she died the next day from multiple gunshot wounds to her head and neck. She was an eyewitness to the murder of Hector Feliciano (Feliciano), and she was under subpoena to testify in a murder trial that was scheduled to commence the next day. Her name was Jennifer Rivera (Jennifer). She was fifteen years of age. Jennifer was killed in order to prevent her from testifying against Charles Pona (Pona or defendant),1 the defendant in this case, who was charged with and awaiting trial on the Feliciano murder.2 In the course of the ensuing police investigation, three individuals—the defendant, Dennard Walker (Walker), the 1', 'Throughout the record, defendant also is referred to as “Manny.” 2', 'The defendant subsequently was convicted of the first-degree murder of Feliciano and other offenses related to that murder.

We affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The events that precipitated this tragic crime began on August 28, 1999, when defendant shot and killed seventeen-year-old Feliciano in the vicinity of Congress Avenue in Providence.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986), the United States Supreme Court held that “the Equal Protection Clause [of the Fourteenth Amendment] forbids [a] prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race * * *.” The Batson Court articulated a three- pronged framework for analyzing a criminal defendant‟s objection to a prosecutor‟s exercise of a peremptory challenge on this ground, id. at 96-98, which is discussed infra.', '-2- witness to this homicide, and he obtained a formal statement from her. She identified defendant from a photo array; she was the sole eyewitness. Based on his investigation, Det. Marsland drafted a warrant for defendant‟s arrest, and Jennifer testified at defendant‟s bail hearing.', 'During her testimony at the bail hearing, with defendant and Perez present, Jennifer disclosed her home address—95 Congress Avenue—and testified that she was home on the night of the Feliciano murder and that she heard gunshots, looked out the window, and saw a lone gunman, whom she later identified as defendant, flee the scene. Although defendant initially was ordered held without bail, he subsequently would be released.', 'He was indicted for Feliciano‟s murder, and the trial was slated to begin on May 22, 2000. Jennifer was listed as a prosecution witness and was under subpoena to appear and testify.', 'While incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) awaiting trial on the Feliciano murder, defendant shared a cell with inmate Dennis Fullen (Fullen), who later testified against him. The record reveals that defendant and Fullen occasionally would discuss the Feliciano murder. Although defendant mentioned possibly paying Jennifer to refrain from testifying against him, he also told Fullen “that he had to dump her” and “that he wanted to get rid of her.” The defendant explained that he wanted Walker and Perez to kill Jennifer, and he expressed anger that Walker had been unable and Perez seemed unwilling to comply. Additionally, defendant expressed his hope for release on bail, so that he could “make sure it got done right.”', 'During this pretrial confinement, Perez visited defendant; during these visits, they would discuss defendant‟s upcoming murder trial, and Jennifer in particular. The defendant explained to Perez that Jennifer “has got to go” and that Walker “need[ed] to handle that.”', 'These admonitions were not ignored; on one occasion, upon observing Jennifer walking down a street,', '-3- Perez exited his vehicle and fired his gun in the air in an effort to intimidate her. When Perez related this encounter to defendant, however, he told defendant that he had been attempting to kill Jennifer, but that the gun had jammed. An angry defendant characterized this effort as “dumb” because it potentially alerted Jennifer that she was in danger. The defendant eventually was released on bail on April 22, 2000, one month before Jennifer was killed.', 'In the early afternoon of May 21, 2000, defendant, Walker, and another friend drove to Lockwood Plaza, where they met Perez. The defendant told Perez that Jennifer was outside of her house. Walker displayed a weapon, and defendant asked Perez if he had a vehicle they could use. Later that day, after Perez secured a vehicle, he drove defendant and Walker to the vicinity of Congress Avenue, where Jennifer lived. As Perez drove by Jennifer‟s house, defendant and Walker spotted Jennifer. At that point, Perez turned the vehicle onto a series of side streets in order to pass by Congress Avenue once more. When the vehicle made its way back to Congress Avenue, Perez saw Jennifer jumping rope with a group of girls. Perez stopped on a nearby street, and Walker exited the vehicle. The defendant told Walker, “[M]ake sure you do it right.” Walker responded, “I can‟t let you do life[.]”', 'Walker then made his way to 95 Congress Avenue; he walked up to Jennifer and shot her multiple times at close range.6 Shortly after hearing gunfire, Perez saw Walker return to the vehicle and heard him declare, “I got her.” Jennifer was rushed to Rhode Island Hospital, where she died from multiple gunshot wounds the next day—which would have been the first day of defendant‟s trial for the Feliciano murder. The trial did not go forward as scheduled. 6', 'Walker testified that he shot Jennifer “[p]robably like four times.” Perez testified that he heard three gunshots. Elizabeth Laposata, M.D. (Dr. Laposata), the state‟s chief medical examiner at the time of Jennifer‟s murder, performed the autopsy. Doctor Laposata determined that Jennifer suffered two gunshot wounds, one to the back of the head and one to the neck.', '-4-', 'Detective-sergeant Vincent Mansolillo (Det. Mansolillo) oversaw the investigation of this homicide. Apparently, Perez had been arrested on unrelated drug charges, and Det. Mansolillo took the opportunity to discuss Jennifer‟s murder.', 'At first, Perez was untruthful and unresponsive, but eventually he admitted his participation and implicated Walker and defendant. During the course of the investigation, a search of Perez‟s prison cell at the ACI, pursuant to a warrant, produced an incriminating letter addressed to Perez and penned by Pona.', 'Detective Mansolillo also met with inmate Fullen, who was then sharing a prison cell with Walker, who was in jail on an unrelated robbery charge. After giving a recorded statement, Fullen agreed to allow a recording device to be planted in his cell to record his conversations with Walker. During one conversation, Fullen and Walker discussed the circumstances of Jennifer‟s murder. Walker disclosed that he was with defendant and Perez on the day of the murder and that defendant told Walker to kill her. Walker admitted that he shot Jennifer three times.', 'The defendant was indicted on August 30, 2002 for numerous offenses arising from the murder of Jennifer Rivera, including murder (count 1), conspiracy to commit murder (count 2), carrying a handgun without a license (count 3), committing a crime of violence while armed with a firearm (count 4), and obstruction of justice (count 5). The defendant was found guilty on all counts, but this Court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 943, 954 (R.I. 2008) (Pona I).', 'Before defendant‟s retrial in April 2010, several pretrial motions were litigated. First, defendant moved to exclude evidence of the cooperation agreements that Perez and Fullen had entered into with prosecuting authorities. Although the trial justice denied defendant‟s motion and allowed the agreements as full exhibits, portions of them were redacted in a manner that was', '-5- agreeable to the parties. Second, defendant requested a jury instruction relative to the credibility of accomplices and cooperating witnesses who testify for the state. The trial justice denied defendant‟s request, explaining that the requested instruction was not required under this Court‟s established caselaw.', 'Third, although the state agreed to redact portions of defendant‟s letter to Perez, defendant requested that more of the letter be redacted.7 Defense counsel argued that the language was irrelevant and highly prejudicial, in that it implied that defendant was incarcerated somewhere outside Rhode Island and that the detectives assigned to his case disbelieved his declarations denying any involvement in Jennifer‟s murder. The state argued that the challenged portion of the letter was probative of defendant‟s guilty state of mind and reflected the overall tenor of the entire letter: cautioning Perez not to divulge any information about Jennifer‟s murder. The trial justice denied defendant‟s request for further redactions, noting that, in his opinion, that portion of the letter was “very vanilla,” did not imply that defendant was imprisoned elsewhere, and was probative for the reasons articulated by the state.', 'The defendant also vigorously sought to exclude any reference to the Feliciano murder. The defendant argued that proof of a motive was not an essential element of the charges against him and that evidence of the Feliciano murder was therefore inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The state responded that much of the evidence that this 7', 'Specifically, defendant requested that the following passage of the letter be excised:', '“Yo[,] these [d]etectives try to come down here and see me[,] talking about they', 'know I was there when that broad got hit.

See Pona I, 948 A.2d at 952 n.14 (“The prosecutor is not prevented from presenting facts in his case-in-chief that are undisputed, including how Jennifer became involved in the first case and the gruesome manner of her death.”); id. at 953 (“[W]e will not go so far as to deny the prosecution the opportunity to make any reference to the fact that defendant was charged with murder * * *.”).', 'The trial justice agreed with the state and held that the evidence of the Feliciano murder would not be excluded in its entirety because it was relevant to show motive and defendant‟s specific intent to have Jennifer killed. After carefully chronicling our decision in Pona I, the trial justice permitted evidence that Jennifer emerged as the key witness in the Feliciano-murder investigation; that she testified at defendant‟s bail hearing and identified him as the man she saw fleeing from the murder scene; and that she was under subpoena to testify at the upcoming trial on the day she was killed. At the same time, however, the trial justice ruled that the tape of the bail hearing would not be played for the jury and that the state could not introduce certain physical evidence from the Feliciano murder—namely, the pager and fingerprints that this Court found objectionable in Pona I. See Pona I, 948 A.2d at 943, 950-52.', 'During jury selection, the state exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse Juror 156, a prospective juror of Hispanic descent. In the course of the voir dire, the prosecutor informed the trial justice and defense counsel that he previously had prosecuted Juror 156‟s cousin and that the trial justice had presided over those proceedings. Although the juror stated that he and his cousin do not speak and indicated that he could be fair to defendant and had no hesitation about sitting as a juror in this case, the prosecutor, at a sidebar conference, expressed his belief that the', '-7- juror should be excused. However, while acknowledging the prosecutor‟s concerns, the trial justice declined to excuse the juror for cause. The state then exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse Juror 156, and defendant raised a Batson argument in response. The trial justice noted that the juror was of Hispanic descent, and he inquired of the prosecutor whether he had a race- neutral reason for the strike. The prosecutor submitted that he exercised a peremptory challenge because, fifteen years earlier, he had prosecuted the juror‟s cousin. The trial justice agreed that the prosecutor had a “completely plausible, credible and rational” race-neutral reason for the strike, and he accordingly overruled defendant‟s Batson challenge.', 'In his opening statement, the prosecutor recounted the murder of Feliciano and the ensuing police investigation; he also described how Jennifer came to be the key eyewitness after identifying Pona as the perpetrator. The defendant renewed his Rule 404(b) objection to the evidence referenced in the prosecutor‟s opening statement, requested a cautionary instruction, and moved to pass the case. The trial justice denied the motion to pass, but he instructed the jury that, although they would hear evidence about the Feliciano murder and that defendant had been indicted for that crime, he was not on trial for that murder and that the jury could only consider this evidence for the limited purpose of showing defendant‟s intent, plan, or motive to kill Jennifer.', 'In the state‟s case-in-chief, Det. Marsland testified, over objection, that he drafted the warrant for defendant‟s arrest on the Feliciano murder; that defendant was arrested for that murder; that Jennifer testified at his bail hearing in connection with the Feliciano case; and that she had identified defendant as the perpetrator.', 'At the conclusion of the state‟s direct examination of Det. Marsland, the trial justice reminded the jury that defendant was not on trial', '-8- for the Feliciano murder and that the Feliciano evidence was offered only for the limited purpose of showing defendant‟s intent, plan, or motive to kill Jennifer.', 'Stephen Mokler (Mokler), a former investigator in the Special Investigations Unit at the ACI, also testified for the state.', 'During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Mokler whether Fullen had “serious enemy issues” at the ACI, necessitating a transfer to the High Security Segregation Unit; Mokler responded in the affirmative.', 'On redirect examination, Mokler testified, this time over defendant‟s objection, that Fullen had been transferred to protective custody and that this transfer was related to Fullen‟s “enemy issues.” The defendant moved to pass the case, arguing that evidence that Fullen was in protective custody was highly prejudicial because it implied that the witness needed protection from defendant. The trial justice denied the motion, explaining that “[t]he record is clear from this witness that the purpose of sending Fullen to protective custody was to deal with the enemy issues that [Mokler] had testified to in the first instance.”', 'For his part, Fullen testified about his discussions with defendant when the two were cellmates, and his cooperation agreement was introduced over defendant‟s objection. Significantly, the trial justice instructed the jury that the cooperation agreement was not being “offered as substantive evidence that Mr. Fullen is, or has, or will testify truthful[ly] in this case.”', 'Perez also testified at length for the state. Again over defendant‟s objection, the state introduced, as a full exhibit, the cooperation agreement between Perez and the state. The trial justice instructed the jury that the cooperation agreement was not being offered as substantive evidence that Perez had or would testify truthfully. Over defendant‟s objection, Perez testified that he named defendant as a co-conspirator when he pled guilty to Jennifer‟s murder. At that', '-9- point, the trial justice reminded the jury that Perez had pled guilty to the crimes for which defendant was now on trial, but that fact was not substantive evidence of defendant‟s guilt and was only being offered for the limited purpose of assessing Perez‟s credibility. Additionally, Perez testified, over objection, that he remembered when defendant was arrested for the Feliciano murder and that he was present at defendant‟s bail hearing when Jennifer testified. The trial justice reminded the jury, yet again, that evidence of the Feliciano murder was being offered for the very limited purpose of showing defendant‟s intent, plan, or motive to kill Jennifer.', 'Perez also provided graphic testimony concerning the events leading up to Jennifer‟s murder. According to Perez, on May 21, 2000, before going to Jennifer‟s house, the group talked about exacting retribution from a member of the Lassiter family for the death of one of their friends a month earlier. Perez told the jury that Walker declared that “[h]e wanted to get one of [the Lassiters].” The witness was permitted to testify, over defendant‟s objection, that Walker wanted “[t]o retaliate for what [the Lassiters] did to our friend.” When the prosecutor asked Perez what had happened to the friend, the trial justice sustained defendant‟s objection and instructed the prosecutor to pursue another line of inquiry. Later in his testimony, Perez stated that, on May 21, 2000, they planned to “[s]ee if [they] bumped into one of the Lassiters” in the Elmwood Avenue area before heading to Jennifer‟s house. Perez further testified, without objection, that the group drove to the Elmwood Avenue area, but, finding no Lassiters, proceeded to Jennifer‟s house on Congress Avenue. Finally, defendant‟s letter to Perez was admitted, over defendant‟s objection, as a full exhibit, and the portion of the letter to which defendant had previously objected was read into evidence.8 8', 'That portion is set forth in footnote 7, supra.', '- 10 -', 'The state also called Walker in its case-in-chief; but it readily became apparent that he was a hostile witness.9 Although admitting that he was the triggerman in Jennifer‟s murder, Walker relayed a very different version of that murder than what Perez recounted. According to Walker, he was riding in a car by himself just before he murdered Jennifer outside of her home; he testified that he acted alone and never spoke to defendant about his murderous intentions. Walker testified that his statements to Fullen in the recorded conversation—in which he declared that he was with Perez and defendant on the day of the murder—were not accurate. Additionally, although he acknowledged that during his plea colloquy he admitted his guilt and alluded to defendant‟s participation in the crimes against Jennifer, Walker insisted that the facts that were placed on the record during his plea colloquy were admitted as true only as they related to Walker‟s involvement in the murder.', 'At the close of the state‟s case, defendant‟s motion for judgment of acquittal on the firearms counts was denied. The defendant renewed his request for a jury instruction concerning the credibility of cooperating witnesses. The trial justice denied this request, but he noted that defendant‟s objection would be “preserved for purposes of [the] instructions.” Although the trial justice did not give the instruction defendant sought, he nevertheless provided the jury with comprehensive instructions for assessing witness credibility, which highlighted the need for the jury to focus on “the interest or lack of interest of the witness, if any, in the outcome of the case, and the bias or the prejudice of the witness, if any, as well as any criminal record that a witness may have.” The instructions also informed the jury that it “may consider whether a witness would have a motive to be truthful or untruthful in his or her testimony.” The trial justice‟s final 9', 'Unlike Perez, Walker had not entered into a cooperation agreement with the state.', '- 11 - charge to the jury also included yet another cautionary instruction on the limited purpose of other-crimes evidence.', 'During the state‟s closing argument, the prosecutor reminded the jury about the cooperation agreements of Perez and Fullen, the promises to tell the truth, and the harsh consequences for failure to do so. Specifically, the prosecutor told the jury the following:', '“There‟s no reason for the police or the Attorney General‟s Office', 'to want a person to implicate a person who didn‟t do anything.', 'And that‟s why the cooperation agreement says if you‟re caught', 'telling a lie, either if you‟re questioned by the police, by the', 'Attorney General‟s Office, by the defense lawyer or by the Court,', 'any party involved, you can get the maximum sentence allowable', 'on your offenses, the agreement is null and void, you can get', 'charged with perjury in addition to the charges you already have.', '“So these cooperation agreements are there for the', 'protection of everyone involved, the defendant, the Court, the', 'State, and the defense. And it shows you exactly what these', 'people [Fullen and Perez] were operating under at the time they', 'provided information. They told the truth and they received a', 'reward if they did for their cooperation.” The defendant made no objection to these comments.', 'The defendant was found guilty on all counts in the indictment. The trial justice denied defendant‟s motion for a new trial, concluding that the jury‟s verdict was “wholly justified by the credible evidence in this case.” He found the testimony of Fullen and Perez to be “unvarnished and unembellished * * *, in a word, credible.” This testimony, he concluded, amply supported the jury verdict. By contrast, the trial justice deemed Walker‟s testimony to be “perjury,” and “pathetic and desperate”; he concluded that “no rational juror charged with the responsibility of judging credibility would or could rely on Walker‟s specious and inane trial testimony.”', 'The trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for Jennifer‟s murder and ten years for conspiracy to commit murder, to be served concurrently. He also sentenced defendant to ten years on count 3, carrying a pistol without a license, to be served consecutive to the', '- 12 - sentences imposed on counts 1 and 4. On count 4, using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, the trial justice imposed a ten-year sentence, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on count 1. Finally, defendant received a five-year concurrent sentence for obstruction of justice. All sentences imposed in this case were ordered to run consecutive to the life sentence that defendant received for the Feliciano murder. The defendant appeals.', 'Issues Presented', 'The defendant‟s appellate contentions can be separated into five categories.', 'First, defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting an array of what he asserts was highly prejudicial evidence. Specifically, defendant assigns error to the trial justice‟s decision to admit: (1) evidence concerning defendant‟s involvement in the Feliciano murder; (2) evidence that defendant, Perez, and Walker were searching for one or more of the Lassiters before proceeding to Jennifer‟s house to kill her; (3) a portion of the letter from defendant to Perez that was seized from Perez‟s ACI cell; and (4) testimony that Fullen was placed in protective custody. Second, defendant urges this Court to adopt a rule requiring trial justices to give a special instruction about accomplice witnesses if requested or, in the alternative, to hold that the trial justice‟s instructions in this case were insufficient to apprise the jury of the dangers of the testimony of accomplices who cooperate with the state. Third, defendant claims that the trial justice erred in rejecting his Batson challenge to the prosecutor‟s decision to strike a prospective juror of Hispanic descent. Fourth, defendant contends that the trial justice allowed the state to impermissibly vouch for the truthfulness of Fullen and Perez. Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. We address each contention in turn.', '- 13 -', 'Analysis', 'I', 'Evidentiary Issues', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in failing to exclude, under Rules 403 and 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, several items of evidence. “[I]t „is well settled that we review a trial justice‟s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.‟” State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 851 (R.I. 2010)). We will reverse a trial justice‟s ruling on the admissibility of evidence only where “it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.” Id.; see also State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012); State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 199 (R.I. 2012).', 'Generally, Rule 404(b)10 “prohibits the use of evidence of prior bad acts, wrongs, or crimes „to show the defendant‟s propensity to commit the crime with which he [or she] is currently charged.‟” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 199 (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 926 (R.I. 2005)); see also State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 150 (R.I. 2010); Pona I, 948 A.2d at 949. This prohibition, however, is not absolute; “[e]vidence of other conduct, even of a criminal nature, may be received if it is interwoven with the current charge in a way that tends to establish guilty knowledge, intent, motive, design, plan, scheme, system, or the like.” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 199 (quoting John, 881 A.2d at 926 (internal quotations omitted)); see also Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 10', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character', 'of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.

Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1160 (R.I. 2006)); see also Pona I, 948 A.2d at 950. Nevertheless, “[h]owever difficult the task, the trial justice must exercise his or her sound discretion in fixing that line and deciding whether this type of evidence should be admitted, excluded, or limited.” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 200. Additionally, “[t]he trial justice also must balance the relevance of the evidence against its remoteness and the potential for improper prejudicial impact.” Id.', 'Rule 404(b) does not represent the only hurdle a proponent of other-acts evidence must surmount. Pona I, 948 A.2d at 950. Such evidence, like all evidence, must survive Rule 403 scrutiny. State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009); Pona I, 948 A.2d at 950. Rule 403, which “cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice‟s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence[,]” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 148, provides:', '“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative', 'value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,', 'confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by', 'considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless', 'presentation of cumulative evidence.” Rule 403. However, “a trial justice‟s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly. * * * It is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial', '- 15 - justice must exclude it.” Smith, 39 A.3d at 675 (quoting State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008)); see also Brown, 42 A.3d at 1244.', 'A. The Feliciano Murder', 'The defendant‟s first assignment of evidentiary error must be assessed in light of our decision in Pona I. In defendant‟s first trial, the state introduced an abundance of evidence concerning defendant‟s involvement in Feliciano‟s murder to a degree that amounted to reversible error. Pona I, 948 A.2d at 943, 948-49. Specifically, in Pona I, the jury was shown the photopack from which Jennifer identified defendant as Feliciano‟s assailant; the jurors learned that defendant‟s pager was found at the murder scene and that his fingerprints were found inside the vehicle leaving the scene; and they also heard the entire audiotape recording of Jennifer‟s bail-hearing testimony, which the prosecutor referred to as Jennifer‟s “voice from the grave.” Id. at 943.', 'In vacating defendant‟s conviction, this Court concluded that the use of this evidence constituted reversible error. Pona I, 948 A.2d at 949. We explained that “the relevancy of the pager and fingerprints was remote and the relationship to Jennifer‟s murder remained tenuous.” Id. at 951. Instead, “this evidence essentially proved that [defendant] was the murderer of another teenager and was extremely prejudicial,” id., because its impact “was to highlight the propensity of [defendant] as a person who had murdered before and who would not hesitate to murder again.” Id. at 949. With respect to Jennifer‟s bail-hearing testimony, we determined that:', '“[T]he Superior Court erred when it did not attempt to strike a', 'balance between the necessity of admission and the danger of', 'unfair prejudice occasioned by the wholesale adoption of the bail-', 'hearing testimony. This type of evidence must be received „with', 'great caution,‟ and a careful review of her testimony reveals that', 'there are particular statements that should have been excluded.”', '- 16 -', 'Id. at 953 (quoting State v. Peters, 86 R.I. 447, 450, 136 A.2d 620,', '621 (1957)). We cautioned that “references to the murder of Feliciano should have been kept to a minimum.” Id.', 'However, nothing we said in Pona I suggested that all reference to the Feliciano murder was off-limits. By contrast, we recognized that it was “undisputed that Walker killed Jennifer for the sole reason of preventing her from testifying against defendant.” Pona I, 948 A.2d at 952 n.14. We declared that “[t]he prosecutor is not prevented from presenting facts in his case-in- chief that are undisputed, including how Jennifer became involved in the first case and the gruesome manner of her death.” Id. Similarly, we explained that:', '“[T]here is no question that [Jennifer‟s] testimony at [defendant‟s]', 'bail hearing, and the fact that she was to testify when he was tried', 'for murdering Feliciano, led to her being killed. * * * We agree', 'that reference to her testimony was reasonable to demonstrate the', 'event that precipitated her tragic death. * * * Although we will not', 'go so far as to deny the prosecution the opportunity to make any', 'reference to the fact that defendant was charged with murder, we', 'nonetheless hold that the quantum of evidence admitted here was', 'extremely prejudicial to defendant and requires reversal.” Id. at', '953. Because it was the quantum of evidence of the Feliciano murder, and not straightforward proof of defendant‟s involvement in that crime, that this Court declared to be reversible error, proof of defendant‟s arrest and Jennifer‟s connection to the prosecution was highly relevant and clearly not off-limits.', 'In this case, the trial justice ably followed our admonitions in Pona I. The quantum of evidence of the Feliciano murder introduced in the retrial radically was reduced from that in Pona I. The photopack, the pager, and the fingerprint evidence were not admitted. The jury did not hear Jennifer‟s “voice from the grave.”', 'Instead, references to the Feliciano murder', '- 17 - appropriately were minimal.', 'Detective Marsland testified that he was involved in the investigation and that it was Jennifer who identified defendant as the man she saw fleeing the murder scene. He also related that Jennifer testified at defendant‟s bail hearing—with defendant and Perez in attendance—and that she was under subpoena to testify against defendant at a trial scheduled to commence the day after she was shot.', 'In sum, the trial justice struck the appropriate balance; he allowed evidence of Jennifer‟s involvement in the Feliciano investigation—which was necessary to understand defendant‟s motive and intent—and excluded evidence that related solely to the prior murder itself, which had no probative force—save for inviting the jury to engage in propensity-based reasoning to conclude that, because defendant was guilty of killing Feliciano, he had also killed again.11', 'The defendant is not entitled to a sanitized version of the state‟s evidence against him; he is guaranteed a fair trial. The record demonstrates that the trial justice carefully instructed the jury on four occasions that the evidence of the Feliciano murder was being admitted for the sole purpose of demonstrating defendant‟s motive, intent, or plan to kill Jennifer. Therefore, in addition to carefully separating the evidence of the Feliciano murder that would be admitted from the evidence that would be excluded, the trial justice safeguarded against the danger that the jury would use this evidence to engage in impermissible propensity-based reasoning.', 'For these reasons, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting evidence showing defendant‟s involvement in the Feliciano murder. 11', 'Before this Court, defendant contends that “the [s]tate and [defendant] could have stipulated that [Jennifer] was going to be a key witness for the [s]tate in an upcoming felony trial, for which he possibly faced a life term.” (Emphasis added.) Although the state could have agreed to such a stipulation, it was not required to do so. Moreover, although such a stipulation evidently was offered by defendant in his first trial, State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 944 (R.I. 2008) (Pona I), there is nothing in the record of the retrial that suggests that such a stipulation was offered in this case.', '- 18 -', 'B. Looking for a Lassiter', 'The defendant next asserts that the trial justice erred in allowing evidence that defendant, Walker, and Perez first went looking for a member of the Lassiter family, intending to exact retribution for a friend‟s death, before they proceeded to 95 Congress Avenue to kill Jennifer. The defendant argues that this evidence was irrelevant, needlessly confusing, and highly prejudicial, since it permitted the jury to infer that these men were a murderous bunch. Having carefully reviewed the record, we are satisfied that this issue is not properly before us.', '“According to our well settled „raise or waive‟ rule, if an issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal.” State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1237 (R.I. 2010) (emphasis added); see also State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 987 (R.I. 2004) (“To preserve an evidentiary issue on appeal, [the] defendant „was required to show us that he objected specifically to this evidence at trial and that he stated the grounds for his objection.‟” quoting State v. Feole, 748 A.2d 239, 243 (R.I. 2000)). We require a specific objection so that the allegation of error can be brought to the attention of the trial justice, who will then have an opportunity to rule on it.', 'At the outset, we note that, without objection, Perez was permitted to testify that, on the day Jennifer was murdered, he, defendant, and Walker discussed “guys that killed one of our friends the month before” and that those “guys” were the Lassiters. The prosecutor then asked, “And what was it about the Lassiters that either you or [Walker] or [defendant] was talking about?” The defendant objected, and the prosecutor offered to rephrase the question. Perez then testified, without objection, that Walker declared that “[h]e wanted to get one of [the Lassiters].” Perez also testified, again without objection, that before going to 95 Congress Avenue, the group went to “[s]ee if [they] bumped into one of the Lassiters[.]” Likewise, Perez testified, without', '- 19 - objection, that he, defendant, and Walker went to a gas station on Elmwood Avenue, did not encounter any Lassiters, and then proceeded to 95 Congress Avenue.', 'To be sure, defendant posed some objections to this line of inquiry. For example, after Perez stated that Walker “wanted to get one of [the Lassiters],” the prosecutor asked, “How come?” The defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Perez answered, “To retaliate for what they did to our friend.” After the prosecutor asked Perez what happened to their friend, defendant‟s objection was sustained. Similarly, when the prosecutor asked Perez about where the group planned to search for a Lassiter, defendant‟s objection was overruled. Perez then testified that the trio planned to look for the Lassiters at a gas station on Elmwood Avenue.', 'However, these objections were general in scope; at no point did defendant state the basis for the objection, let alone make an argument centered on Rule 403. Moreover, Perez gave the most critical portions of his testimony about the Lassiters—that the Lassiters had killed one of their friends the month before, that Walker “wanted to get one of them,” and that the group actually went looking for the Lassiters—in the absence of any objection.', 'Additionally, much of the same evidence also was admitted, without objection, during Walker‟s testimony. Walker acknowledged that he told Fullen that he, defendant, and Perez were “looking for a Lassiter” on the day he murdered Jennifer. Similarly, the prosecutor read for the jury the statement of facts accompanying Walker‟s guilty plea; these facts included that Walker wanted revenge for the death of one of their friends at the hands of the Lassiters and that, before proceeding to Congress Avenue to kill Jennifer, the group went looking for Kendall Lassiter. Walker testified that, at the time of his plea, he acknowledged in open court that this statement of facts was true. The defendant lodged no objection to any of this testimony.', '- 20 -', 'We are of the opinion that defendant‟s objections to this evidence, to the extent any were made, were not sufficiently focused to alert the trial justice to a Rule 403 basis for exclusion of the evidence. Coupled with defendant‟s failure to object to the critical portions of this evidence, defendant‟s general objections did not preserve his Rule 403 argument for our review. See State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006) (“Even if we were to overlook the temporal insufficiency of defense counsel‟s objections, the general, rather than specific, character of the objections failed to adequately alert the trial justice to [the] defendant‟s concern * * *.”); State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1108 (R.I. 1999) (“[D]efense counsel asserted a general rather than a specific objection at trial; therefore, the objection has not been preserved for appeal.”).', 'C. Pona’s Letter to Perez', 'The defendant also claims that the trial justice erred in admitting the following portion of his letter to Perez:', '“Yo[,] these [d]etectives try to come down here and see me[,]', 'talking about they know I was there when that broad got hit. I was', 'like[, „Y]o, I don[‟]t know nothing[.] [I]f you got so much[,] why', 'you questioning me about it[?‟] They was like[, „C]ome on[,', 'M]anny[,] you know something[.‟] I was like[, „Y]ou came all the', 'way down here for nothing. Whatever is whatever.[‟]” The defendant contends that this excerpt was highly prejudicial because: (1) the phrase “you came all the way down here” suggested that defendant was incarcerated outside the state “because he was a dangerous man”; and (2) it related defendant‟s impression that the detectives did not believe his denials, which would tend to “encourage the jury to base its decision on the', '- 21 - disbelief of the detectives.” This danger of unfair prejudice, defendant argues, when coupled with the marginal relevance of this evidence, required exclusion under Rule 403.12 We disagree.', 'In denying defendant‟s motion in limine to exclude this portion of defendant‟s letter, the trial justice remarked that the evidence was “very vanilla”; he found that the phrase “came all the way down here” just as easily could mean that the detectives needed to travel “all the way down” to the ACI to speak with defendant. We are in full agreement with the trial justice‟s assessment of the prejudice of this letter. Moreover, contrary to defendant‟s assertion, this portion of the letter was more than marginally relevant; it conveyed to Perez that he too should not cooperate in the investigation of Jennifer‟s murder, thereby tending to establish defendant‟s guilty state of mind. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in permitting this evidence to come before the jury.', 'D. Fullen in Protective Custody', 'The final instance of claimed evidentiary error concerns Mokler‟s testimony that Fullen was placed into protective custody at the ACI. The defendant contends that this evidence tended to suggest that Fullen required protection from defendant and was, therefore, unfairly prejudicial. This contention misses the mark.', 'The state did not elicit this testimony from Mokler until after defendant opened the door to this topic. It was defense counsel who inquired about Fullen‟s “serious enemy issues” at the ACI. On redirect examination, Mokler testified that Fullen was transferred to protective custody and that this transfer was related to these same “enemy issues.” In denying defendant‟s motion to pass the case, the trial justice explained that “[t]he record is clear from this witness that the 12', 'In his reply brief, defendant asserts that, to the extent that the letter relates what the detectives told defendant, it contains inadmissible hearsay. No hearsay argument was made at trial, however, and we will not entertain its debut on appeal.', '- 22 - purpose of sending Fullen to protective custody was to deal with the enemy issues that [Mokler] had testified to in the first instance.” We agree with the trial justice that no unfair prejudice flowed from this testimony, and we discern no abuse of discretion in denying the motion to pass and admitting this evidence.', 'II', 'Accomplice Instruction', 'The defendant also assails the trial justice‟s refusal to instruct the jury about the dangers of testimony from accomplices who cooperate with the state. When we are called upon to review “issues pertaining to jury instructions, we do so de novo.” State v. Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010); see also State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1031 (R.I. 2007). In conducting this task, we remain mindful that the trial justice‟s jury “instructions „need only adequately cover [ ] the law.” State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 488 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Hanes, 783 A.2d 920, 925 (R.I. 2001)); see also State v. Carpio, 43 A.3d 1, 10 (R.I. 2012). We do not simply home in on single sentences in the challenged jury instructions; we instead “examine the challenged portion in the context in which it was delivered to ascertain how a jury composed of ordinary, intelligent lay people would have understood the instructions.” Sivo, 809 A.2d at 488; see also Carpio, 43 A.3d at 10. “The trial justice is bound to ensure that the jury charge „sufficiently addresses the requested instructions and correctly states the applicable law.‟” Carpio, 43 A.3d at 10 (quoting State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 913 (R.I. 2007)).', 'We repeatedly have held that “it is not necessary for a trial justice to give an accomplice charge.” State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397, 405 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Sivo, 809 A.2d at 491); see also State v. Marrapese, 583 A.2d 537, 545 (R.I. 1990); State v. Mastrofine, 551 A.2d 1174, 1176 (R.I. 1988); State v. Fenner, 503 A.2d 518, 525 (R.I. 1986); State v. DeMasi, 413 A.2d 99, 100', '- 23 - (R.I. 1980). We refrain from thrusting a trial justice into the unfamiliar role of advocate because “[c]ounsel are given adequate opportunities to argue matters of credibility, including bias, motivation, anticipated benefits or rewards.” Sivo, 809 A.2d at 491 (quoting Fenner, 503 A.2d at 525). Indeed, “[i]n this jurisdiction judges are inhibited from commenting upon the evidence unless they do so in a completely impartial manner.” Id. (quoting Fenner, 503 A.2d at 525). “Thus, „[c]ounsel rather than the court are the appropriate agents to argue to the jury concerning the specific credibility or lack thereof of a particular witness.‟” Drew, 919 A.2d at 406 (quoting Fenner, 503 A.2d at 525).', 'The defendant candidly acknowledges this substantial body of caselaw, but he nevertheless entreats us to overrule it. We were confronted with a similar importunity in Drew, 919 A.2d at 405. We rejected that request, noting that “this Court will consider overturning precedent only „if the motivating purpose is to eliminate inconsistency and anomalous results‟” and that “[t]he defendant proffer[ed] no evidence to suggest that the present case undermine[d] our existing law.” Id. at 406 (quoting State v. Werner, 865 A.2d 1049, 1056 (R.I. 2005)).', 'In this case, defendant attempts to portray this issue in a different light. He contends that the trial justice‟s instructions, unlike the instructions in Drew, Sivo, Fenner, and DeMasi, did not name the cooperating accomplices—Perez in particular—or remind the jury that cooperation with authorities in exchange for promises of leniency may influence such a witness‟s testimony. According to defendant, the possibility that some trial justices may name the cooperating accomplices in their instructions, while others do not, presents a sufficiently serious inconsistency to warrant overruling our precedent. We are unconvinced.', 'The trial justice provided the jury with a comprehensive instruction on evaluating witness credibility; it included:', '- 24 -', '“You should consider the interest or lack of interest of the', 'witness, if any, in the outcome of the case, and the bias or the', 'prejudice of the witness, if any, as well as any criminal record that', 'a witness may have.', '“You may consider whether a witness would have a motive', 'to be truthful or untruthful in his or her testimony, and you may', 'further consider the probability or the improbability of the truth of', 'a witness‟s testimony.” The trial justice thus alerted the jury to the possibility that a witness‟s interest in the case, or his bias or motive to be untruthful may impact that witness‟s credibility. Our caselaw requires nothing more.', 'Clearly, the trial justice did not specifically identify Perez or mention the fact of his cooperation agreement with the state during this instruction—nor was he required to do so. By the close of the evidence, the jury hardly could be expected to overlook Perez‟s testimony. As the crucial witness for the state, Perez offered the most damning of all the testimony about defendant‟s involvement in Jennifer‟s murder. Additionally, the state‟s cooperation agreements with both Fullen and Perez were admitted as full exhibits, and defense counsel extensively cross- examined both witnesses on the promises they received from the state in exchange for their cooperation. Moreover, as our caselaw on this issue envisions, defense counsel vigorously argued during closing argument that the promises Perez and Fullen received in exchange for their testimony should lead the jury to evaluate their credibility with skepticism. Therefore, we are satisfied that defendant‟s assertion of instructional error is without merit.', 'III', 'Batson Challenge', 'The defendant next attacks the state‟s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse a juror of Hispanic descent. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution “guarantees the defendant that the State will not exclude members of his [or', '- 25 - her] race from the jury venire on account of race[.]” State v. Pona, 926 A.2d 592, 601 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 86 (1986)). To determine whether a defendant has been deprived of this guarantee by the state‟s use of a peremptory challenge, we employ Batson‟s familiar tripartite test. Id. at 601; State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 935 (R.I. 1998). “First, the defendant must „establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination[.]‟” Pona, 926 A.2d at 601 (quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 96 (emphasis added)); see also Price, 706 A.2d at 935. “Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the prosecution to articulate its race-neutral reason(s) for challenging that particular juror.” Price, 706 A.2d at 935; see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 97; Pona, 926 A.2d at 601. Finally, “[t]he trial court is then left to determine whether the defendant has carried his or her burden of proving purposeful racial discrimination.” Price, 706 A.2d at 935; see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 98; Pona, 926 A.2d at 601.', 'We have remarked that the “decisive question” in a Batson inquiry “will be whether counsel‟s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed. There will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.” Price, 706 A.2d at 935 (quoting State v. Holley, 604 A.2d 772, 778 (R.I. 1992)). Accordingly, “[t]he trial justice‟s evaluation of the prosecutor‟s state of mind is accorded great deference.” Id.; see also Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 477 (2008) (“On appeal, a trial court‟s ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous.”); Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 & n.21; Pona, 926 A.2d at 602.', 'In this case, we will assume that defendant satisfied Batson‟s first step. Although the trial justice did not state explicitly whether defendant satisfied this first prong, he noted that the', '- 26 - excused juror was of Hispanic descent,13 and he inquired of the prosecutor whether a race-neutral reason existed for the strike. The trial justice next proceeded to rule on the ultimate question of discrimination. “[T]hus, „the preliminary issue of whether [ ] defendant had made a prima facie showing [became] moot.‟” Pona, 926 A.2d at 607 (quoting State v. Austin, 642 A.2d 673, 678 (R.I. 1994)). Additionally, there can be little doubt that the prosecutor‟s articulated reason for the strike—that the prosecutor had prosecuted the juror‟s cousin fifteen years before defendant‟s trial—is race-neutral, thereby satisfying Batson‟s second prong. Therefore, the only contention between the parties on this issue is whether the prosecutor legitimately struck the challenged juror for the stated reason or instead did so on account of the juror‟s race.', 'The defendant argues, as he did below, that the fact that the juror stated that he “never” spoke with his cousin, who had been prosecuted by the prosecutor, demonstrates that the prosecutor‟s articulated reason for the strike was pretextual. However, the trial justice found, without hesitation, that the prosecutor properly set forth a race-neutral reason for the strike and that he did not harbor a racially discriminatory purpose, explaining that “[t]he fact remains that the State of Rhode Island * * * prosecuted this man‟s cousin. That‟s reason enough for me, on its face, to allow [the prosecutor] to exercise a challenge. I find that the reason for doing so is completely plausible, credible and rational.”', 'The defendant has offered no reason, save for critiquing the persuasiveness of the articulated rationale, for us to disturb the trial justice‟s appraisal of the prosecutor‟s state of mind—an evaluation we accord “great deference.” Price, 706 A.2d at 935. The prosecutor‟s reason was not facially implausible or unpersuasive so as to compel a finding that it was 13', 'Although the challenged juror was not of the same race as defendant—an African-American male—this fact is irrelevant to the Batson inquiry; the United States Supreme Court has “eliminated the requirement that a criminal defendant share the same race as a challenged juror * * *.” Pona, 926 A.2d at 602 (citing Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 415 (1991)).', '- 27 - pretextual. See Austin, 642 A.2d at 678 (“[T]he trial judge reasonably found that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge because the prospective juror‟s son was incarcerated at the ACI on a robbery conviction. Although the trial justice found that this relationship was an insufficient reason to excuse the juror for cause, it is certainly sufficient to verify its race-neutral character.”); see, e.g., United States v. Charlton, 600 F.3d 43, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2010) (recognizing as a race-neutral justification the prosecutor‟s decision to strike an African-American prospective juror whose son was incarcerated “for a crime similar to the one charged against [the defendant]”); United States v. Hendrix, 509 F.3d 362, 370 (7th Cir. 2007) (recognizing that striking minority jurors because they have “relatives in prison * * * is a valid and race-neutral basis * * *[;] [j]urors with relatives in prison may sympathize with a defendant, or have feelings of animosity against the prosecution”); United States v. Crawford, 413 F.3d 873, 875 (8th Cir. 2005) (“There is no Batson violation when a juror is dismissed because the juror‟s relatives have been prosecuted or convicted of a crime * * *.”); Mitleider v. Hall, 391 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir. 2004) (upholding as a “facially reasonable race-neutral” ground the prosecutor‟s decision to strike an African-American prospective juror whose brother had been convicted of possession of cocaine); Nieto v. State, 365 S.W.3d 673, 677, 679 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (upholding as a race- neutral justification the prosecutor‟s decision to strike an African-American prospective juror who shared a last name with defendants that the prosecutor had recently prosecuted). We therefore affirm the trial justice‟s denial of defendant‟s Batson challenge.', 'IV', 'Vouching', 'We next turn to defendant‟s contention that the state impermissibly utilized the cooperation agreements between the state and Fullen and Perez to suggest that the state had', '- 28 - special knowledge that Fullen and Perez were testifying truthfully. In this context, we have remarked that “[o]ne means through which improper vouching may occur is by admission of plea agreements phrased in a manner that suggests that the government has special knowledge that its witness is speaking the truth.” State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 32-33 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Chakouian, 537 A.2d 409, 412 (R.I. 1988)). Improper vouching also arises when “the prosecution place[s] the prestige of the government behind the witness.” Id. at 33 (quoting Chakouian, 537 A.2d at 412). Nonetheless, we have recognized that a “mere statement in a plea agreement that a witness promises to speak „truthfully‟ does not by itself constitute improper vouching.” Id. (quoting Chakouian, 537 A.2d at 412). Along similar lines, “a statement in a plea agreement that perjury charges will be brought if the defendant makes any false statement under oath[,]” without more, is likewise insufficient to establish improper vouching. Id. (quoting Chakouian, 537 A.2d at 412).', 'In this case, defendant focuses on the state‟s use of the cooperation agreements during closing argument. The defendant argues that by referencing the portion of the cooperation agreements that warned of reinstatement of the maximum allowable sentence and perjury charges for failure to testify truthfully, the state suggested that it had special knowledge that Fullen and Perez were truthful; because the jury was led to believe that the witnesses had been given the benefit of their bargain and had not been prosecuted for perjury, the argument goes, the state improperly vouched for the truthfulness of these witnesses. We reject this contention.', 'At the outset, we note that defendant has failed to preserve any challenge to the prosecutor‟s closing argument.', 'The defendant made no objection to the now-challenged remarks. To preserve “the issue of prejudicial impropriety in a closing argument, a defendant must not only make an objection at the time when the allegedly improper comment is made, but', '- 29 - he or she must also make a request for a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial.” State v. Fortes, 922 A.2d 143, 149 (R.I. 2007); see also State v. Remy, 910 A.2d 793, 800 (R.I. 2006). The defendant has failed to comply with even this initial preservation hurdle.', 'The defendant vigorously disputes this conclusion, arguing that, because he raised a pretrial objection to the admissibility of the cooperation agreements, which the trial justice stated would be “protected,” and renewed this objection before each cooperation agreement was admitted, this issue has been preserved. We disagree. The defendant‟s objections before and during trial concerned the admissibility of the agreements. The defendant raises a different appellate challenge; he does not claim simply that the cooperation agreements should have been excluded, but instead argues that the prosecutor, while referencing the agreements in his closing argument, improperly vouched for the truthfulness of Fullen and Perez.', 'Clearly, the trial objections did not encompass the now-challenged comment during closing argument.', 'In any event, this aspect of defendant‟s appeal, even if it had been preserved, is without merit. To the extent defendant attempted to lodge an appellate attack on the admissibility of the cooperation agreements themselves, the trial justice‟s decision is amply supported by our decision in Diefenderfer. Although the cooperation agreements require truthfulness on the part of the cooperating witnesses and warn that perjury charges will be initiated if the witnesses give false testimony, these statements, standing alone, do not constitute improper vouching. See Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d at 33; Chakouian, 537 A.2d at 412. This conclusion makes sense; “the promise by a party to a plea [or cooperation] agreement that he or she will speak truthfully „is the same promise he or she makes when called as a witness at trial[,]‟” and the specter of a perjury prosecution for testifying falsely is a reality all witnesses confront. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d at 33', '- 30 - n.36 (quoting Chakouian, 537 A.2d at 412); see G.L. 1956 § 11-33-1(a) (defining crime of perjury).', 'In the face of this established law, defendant focuses in this appeal on the prosecutor‟s statements during closing argument. In support of his position, defendant cites to the Ninth Circuit‟s decision in United States v. Roberts, 618 F.2d 530, 533 (9th Cir. 1980), where the prosecutor stated, during closing argument, the following about the cooperating witness: “If he was caught lying as to material facts in any one of these matters, then his plea agreement would be called off. The charges of first-degree murder would be reinstated, and he would stand a very good likelihood of going to the gas chamber.” In this case, defendant seizes on the similarity between the prosecutor‟s statement in Roberts that the cooperating witness would be “going to the gas chamber” and the prosecutor‟s statement in this case that false testimony would result in reinstatement of the maximum allowable sentence and initiation of perjury charges.', 'We are not persuaded. The prosecutor‟s gas-chamber statement in Roberts was not the basis for the court‟s finding of impermissible vouching; rather, the impermissible vouching arose from the prosecutor‟s statement that a state-police officer had attended the trial on “a mission * * * to sit and listen to the testimony of [the cooperating witness].” Roberts, 618 F.2d at 533; see id. at 532 (“We hold the prosecutor committed reversible error by using [the state-police officer‟s] presence to argue for [the cooperating witness‟s] credibility.”); id. at 534 (“The prosecutor in this case referred to evidence not in the record by declaring that [the officer] was monitoring [the witness‟s] testimony. * * * In effect, the prosecutor was telling the jury that another witness could have been called to support [the witness‟s] testimony. This was error.”). The prosecutor‟s statements in this case were well-grounded in the record evidence of the cooperation agreements; he merely recited the consequences of failing to abide by the terms of', '- 31 - the cooperation agreement, and those consequences were already outlined in the four corners of those agreements. Therefore, we reject defendant‟s argument that the state engaged in improper vouching.', 'V', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Finally, we turn to defendant‟s contention that the trial justice erroneously denied his motion for a new trial. “When a trial justice considers whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, he or she sits as the legendary thirteenth juror; and, in light of the charge to the jury, must exercise his or her independent judgment in weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” Smith, 39 A.3d at 673 (quoting State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009)). Compliance with this standard requires three steps: “[t]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 354 (R.I. 2011)). If this process leads the trial justice to “the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Our review of a trial justice‟s ruling on a motion for a new trial is deferential; “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Smith, 39 A.3d at 673 (quoting State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 967 (R.I. 2005)). “We employ this deferential standard of review because „a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an', '- 32 - especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.‟” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008)).', 'In this case, defendant assails the trial justice‟s credibility determinations; he contends that Perez and Fullen were not worthy of belief because their cooperation with the state colored their testimony and, conversely, that Walker, who had no motive to testify against Pona to receive favorable treatment, should have been deemed credible. Additionally, defendant argues that the criminal records of Fullen and Perez make their testimony suspect, and he further points out that Perez gave inconsistent versions of Jennifer‟s murder to police. We are unconvinced.', 'In the mine-run of cases, credibility battles are won or lost in Superior Court.', 'A defendant‟s disagreement with a trial justice‟s credibility determinations “is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010)). Because the trial justice has observed the witnesses testify, he or she is in a better position than this Court to assess their credibility. Id.; see also Rivera, 987 A.2d at 903. Thus, we will uphold a trial justice‟s credibility determination “unless the trial justice clearly erred * * * or „overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence.‟” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1368 (R.I. 1994)).', 'This case is no exception to this general rule. The trial justice recognized that Fullen and Perez each “arrived with baggage.” Nonetheless, the trial justice found their testimony to be “unvarnished and unembellished * * *, in a word, credible.” On the other hand, the trial justice deemed Walker‟s testimony to be “pathetic and desperate” and characterized it as “perjury.” He found that “no rational juror charged with the responsibility of judging credibility would or could rely on Walker‟s specious and inane trial testimony,” and he referred to Walker‟s “mendacious', '- 33 - lame efforts to exonerate [defendant].” The trial justice expressed his belief that, ironically, Walker “became the [s]tate‟s strongest witness” because his testimony was “so absurd and so ridiculous.” In sum, the trial justice determined that “[t]he guilty verdicts in this trial were fully justified beyond any doubt.”', 'The defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice, who observed firsthand the testimony of these witnesses, clearly erred or overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence. Therefore, we affirm the trial justice‟s denial of defendant‟s motion for a new trial.', 'The End', 'After thirteen years, two trials, two appeals, and assorted collateral litigation,14 the defendant and those responsible for cutting the life of this fifteen-year-old girl tragically short, in a brutal assault on our system of justice, have nonetheless been afforded the benefits of the constitutional process each sought to subvert. The defendant, Charles Pona, has had his day in court, and the rule of law has prevailed. The name “Jennifer Rivera” forever will be associated with virtue and valor. We affirm the conviction.', 'For the reasons articulated above, we close the final chapter in this chronicle.

37,Nelson Cruz et al. : v. : DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Airbags are a relatively modern safety feature in passenger vehicles; they are designed to deploy in the event of a collision. When the airbags in a stationary vehicle unexpectedly deploy, as they did in this case, something has gone wrong. The question presented in this appeal is whether the hearing justice correctly concluded that the seller of that vehicle could not be held legally responsible for the resulting harm. This case came before the Supreme Court, sitting at Exeter-West Greenwich Regional High School in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, on April 4, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 28, 2004, Nelson Cruz and his wife, Elaine Cruz (collectively, plaintiffs), filed a complaint against DaimlerChrysler Motors Corporation (DaimlerChrysler) and Ricky', '-1- Smith Pontiac GMC, Inc. (Ricky Smith). The complaint alleged that, on or about December 30, 2001, Cruz was cleaning the inside of his minivan—a 1996 Grand Caravan manufactured by DaimlerChrysler—when both front airbags unexpectedly deployed, injuring him. Cruz had purchased this vehicle three years earlier from Ricky Smith, a car dealership in Weymouth, Massachusetts. According to Cruz, before he purchased the vehicle, one of Ricky Smith’s employees had informed him that the vehicle was safe and had never been involved in an accident. Cruz alleged that the vehicle had, in fact, been in at least one accident before he purchased it.', 'Based on these facts, Cruz alleged negligence and strict products liability against both defendants. 1 He also sought recovery against Ricky Smith for negligent misrepresentation and against DaimlerChrysler based on failure to warn and negligent design. Additionally, Elaine Cruz claimed damages from both defendants for loss of consortium. 2 The Cruzes later moved to amend their complaint under Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure by adding a count seeking recovery based on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. 3 That motion was granted in May 2010.', 'In an answer filed on January 18, 2005, DaimlerChrysler denied liability and raised several affirmative defenses. After DaimlerChrysler filed a suggestion of bankruptcy in May 1', 'Because plaintiffs conceded below that summary judgment should enter in Ricky Smith’s favor on the claim for strict products liability, we do not discuss the parties’ arguments relating to that cause of action. 2', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 9-1-41(a), “[a] married person is entitled to recover damages for loss of consortium caused by tortious injury to his or her spouse.” Such an action is “derivative” and “is dependent upon the success of the [spouse’s] underlying tort claim.” Fiorenzano v. Lima, 982 A.2d 585, 591 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Sama v. Cardi Corp., 569 A.2d 432, 433 (R.I. 1990)). 3', 'This Latin phrase means “the thing speaks for itself.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1424 (9th ed. 2009). It is not an independent cause of action, but rather a doctrine under which a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of negligence. See id.; see also Olshansky v. Rehrig International, 872 A.2d 282, 288 (R.I. 2005). We discuss this doctrine in detail in part IV-A, infra.', '-2- 2009, plaintiffs dismissed all claims against it pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which permits voluntary dismissal of claims.', 'Ricky Smith moved for summary judgment on all counts on October 28, 2010. Regarding plaintiffs’ claim for negligence, it argued that plaintiffs “ha[d] produced no evidence to show that the [airbag] incident took place as a result of a defect which [it] knew or should have known of or that even existed in the vehicle when it was sold.” It highlighted the lack of expert testimony about why the airbags had deployed—a matter beyond the common knowledge of a layperson. The plaintiffs could not make out a claim for negligence using the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, it argued, because Ricky Smith had no control over the vehicle and plaintiffs had not eliminated other potential causes for the incident. Regarding plaintiffs’ claim for negligent misrepresentation, it argued that the evidence was insufficient to support this claim. Finally, it contended that, under the doctrine of spoliation, summary judgment should be entered in its favor because plaintiffs had failed to retain the vehicle, preventing Ricky Smith from inspecting it. 4', 'The plaintiffs objected to Ricky Smith’s motion for summary judgment on January 19, 2011. In an accompanying memorandum, plaintiffs refuted each of Ricky Smith’s arguments. Additionally, in an affidavit supporting their objection to Ricky Smith’s motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs averred that various employees at Ricky Smith had told them that the vehicle was not defective, had not been involved in any accidents, and had not had any major repairs. 4', '“The doctrine of spoliation provides that ‘the deliberate or negligent destruction of relevant evidence by a party to litigation may give rise to an inference that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to that party.’” McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 282 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Mead v. Papa Razzi Restaurant, 840 A.2d 1103, 1108 (R.I. 2004)). After the incident, plaintiffs failed to make payments on the vehicle; it was eventually repossessed. During Nelson Cruz’s deposition in 2006, counsel for DaimlerChrysler indicated that the vehicle had been located in Brooklyn, New York.', '-3- The plaintiffs further maintained that they relied on these representations in purchasing the vehicle.', 'Regarding the negligence claim, plaintiffs argued that the facts presented “a classic case for the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which was intended to eliminate the very evidentiary strictures applicable to proving proximate cause cited by Ricky Smith.” Citing to precedent from both this Court and the Superior Court, they claimed that Ricky Smith had misstated the law relevant to this doctrine. Regarding the negligent misrepresentation claim, plaintiffs asserted that both circumstantial evidence and their affidavit constituted evidence of their reliance on the representations regarding the condition of the vehicle. Finally, plaintiffs contended that Ricky Smith could not claim entitlement to summary judgment under the doctrine of spoliation because it had an opportunity to inspect the vehicle and because plaintiffs did not deliberately or negligently destroy it.', 'The matter came before a justice of the Superior Court on February 1, 2011. 5 On the negligence claim, she found that plaintiffs “ha[d] failed to produce evidence that [Ricky Smith] caused harm to [them].”', 'She noted that plaintiffs had produced no evidence, such as an inspection report or expert testimony, to demonstrate that Ricky Smith was negligent. She also found that plaintiffs could not make out a claim for negligence using the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. On the misrepresentation claim, she found that plaintiffs had submitted no evidence to show that any of Ricky Smith’s employees knew that the statements they allegedly made about the vehicle’s condition were false. Accordingly, the trial justice granted Ricky Smith’s motion for summary judgment on all counts. 5', 'At the outset, the hearing justice noted that she had heard arguments “[w]ith respect to the negligence claim” a week earlier. The docket sheet indicates that a hearing scheduled for January 25, 2011, was continued by agreement of the parties. The parties have not submitted a transcript from a hearing on that date.', '-4-', 'Judgment entered on February 18, 2011. The plaintiffs then timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The issue on appeal is whether the trial justice correctly granted Ricky Smith’s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation. On appeal, the parties reiterate the arguments they advanced below.', 'The plaintiffs’ primary contention is that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur should apply in this case. The vehicle must have been defective, they contend, or else the airbags would not have deployed in the absence of an impact while the car was stationary. According to plaintiffs, their deposition testimony demonstrates that the vehicle’s airbag system had neither malfunctioned nor been altered before this incident. Ricky Smith, they argue, had a duty to discover and disclose any defect with the vehicle. Additionally, plaintiffs maintain that Ricky Smith incorrectly suggested to the hearing justice that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was inapplicable because they had not eliminated all other possible causes of the accident. The plaintiffs also argue that the hearing justice misstated the law relevant to their claim of misrepresentation and therefore erred in granting summary judgment on that claim.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“[S]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” DeMaio v. Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 129 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 390 (R.I. 2008)). Ordinarily, claims sounding in negligence are appropriately resolved through a trial, but summary adjudication is proper when the “facts', '-5- suggest only one reasonable inference.” Id. at 130 (quoting Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc., 119 R.I. 70, 77, 376 A.2d 329, 333 (1977)). This Court reviews de novo the granting of a motion for summary judgment, and it applies the same standard used by the hearing justice. Id. at 129 (citing Jessup & Conroy, P.C. v. Seguin, 46 A.3d 835, 838 (R.I. 2012) and Papudesu v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island, 18 A.3d 495, 497 (R.I. 2011)). “We will affirm the grant of summary judgment only ‘[i]f we conclude, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be decided and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law * * *.’” Id. (quoting Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 372 (R.I. 2011)).', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Negligence', 'The four elements of negligence are “a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.” Olshansky v. Rehrig International, 872 A.2d 282, 289 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Mills v. State Sales, Inc., 824 A.2d 461, 467 (R.I. 2003)). Because plaintiffs lack direct proof of Ricky Smith’s negligence, they have attempted to make out a prima facie negligence claim through the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. This doctrine “establishes inferential evidence of a defendant’s negligence * * * and casts upon a defendant the burden of rebutting the same to the satisfaction of the jury.” Id. at 288 (quoting McLaughlin v. Moura, 754 A.2d 95, 98 (R.I. 2000)). Before addressing whether the hearing justice erred in finding that plaintiffs', '-6- could not maintain a negligence claim against Ricky Smith based on res ipsa loquitur, we first provide an overview of this doctrine.', 'In Parrillo v. Giroux Co., 426 A.2d 1313, 1320 (R.I. 1981), this Court adopted § 328D of the Restatement (Second) Torts.', 'This approach permits an inference of negligence on a defendant’s part when:', '“(a) the event is of a kind which ordinarily does not occur', 'in the absence of negligence; (b) other responsible causes,', 'including the conduct of the plaintiff and third persons, are', 'sufficiently eliminated by the evidence; and (c) the indicated', 'negligence is within the scope of the defendant’s duty to the', 'plaintiff.” Restatement (Second) Torts § 328D(1) at 156 (1965). In adopting this approach, Parrillo expressly disavowed a previous requirement that res ipsa loquitur applied only where the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality which harmed the plaintiff. 426 A.2d at 1320.', 'Our jurisprudence on this doctrine became somewhat inconsistent in Parrillo’s wake. In 1987, citing a decision that predated Parrillo, we appeared to restore the requirement of exclusive control. See Sousa v. Chaset, 519 A.2d 1132, 1136 (R.I. 1987) (citing Montuori v. Narragansett Electric Co., 418 A.2d 5, 13 (R.I. 1980)). Similarly, a 1993 order (citing pre-Parrillo authority) suggested that the exclusive control requirement was alive and well. See Voyer v. New England Chemical Co., 634 A.2d 1175, 1176 (R.I. 1993) (mem.) (citing William L. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts ch. 6 at 214 (4th ed. 1971)). In 1998, we recognized that Parrillo “part[ed] company” with the exclusive control requirement. See Errico v. LaMountain, 713 A.2d 791, 796 (R.I. 1998). The following year, however, we made an about-face. See Lauro v. Knowles, 739 A.2d 1183, 1185 (R.I. 1999) (citing Voyer, 634 A.2d at 1176). We last resurrected the exclusive control requirement in 2005, again relying on pre-Parrillo authority. See Olshansky, 872 A.2d at 288-89 (citing Lauro, 739 A.2d at 1185).', '-7-', 'We take this opportunity to reaffirm Parrillo’s adoption of § 328D of the Restatement (Second) Torts. “[T]he critical inquiry is not control, but whether a particular defendant is the responsible cause of the [plaintiff’s] injury.” Parrillo, 426 A.2d at 1320. To the extent that our prior decisions are inconsistent with Parrillo, they are no longer to be followed.', 'After reviewing our precedent on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and carefully examining the facts of this case, we conclude that plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of this doctrine to make out a claim for negligence against Ricky Smith. Roughly three years passed between the purchase of the vehicle in December 1998 and the airbag malfunction in December 2001. The plaintiffs assert that Ricky Smith had a duty to discover whatever defect made the vehicle’s airbags spontaneously deploy. This assertion assumes that the vehicle was defective when it was sold. Had the airbags deployed shortly after plaintiffs purchased the vehicle, res ipsa loquitur might have permitted that inference, but it is not supported by these facts.', 'We agree with plaintiffs’ assertion that “[t]he spontaneous deployment of air bags [sic] while a passenger is cleaning out a vehicle is an event which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence.” However, “[i]t is * * * insufficient to show that the accident is of the kind that does not ordinarily occur without negligence; the negligence must point to the defendant.”', 'Konicki v. Lawrence, 475 A.2d 208, 210 (R.I. 1984).', 'In this case, “other responsible causes” have not been “sufficiently eliminated by the evidence.” See Parrillo, 426 A.2d at 1320 (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 328D(1)(b)). Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice properly granted summary judgment in Ricky Smith’s favor on plaintiffs’ negligence claim.', '-8-', 'B', 'Negligent Misrepresentation', 'The tort of negligent misrepresentation has four elements:', '“(1) a misrepresentation of a material fact; (2) the representor must', 'either know of the misrepresentation, must make the', 'misrepresentation without knowledge as to its truth or falsity or', 'must make the representation under circumstances in which he [or', 'she] ought to have known of its falsity; (3) the representor must', 'intend the representation to induce another to act on it; and (4)', 'injury must result to the party acting in justifiable reliance on the', 'misrepresentation.” Manchester v.

Children’s Friend & Service, 661', 'A.2d 67, 69 (R.I. 1995)).', 'In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that, when Ricky Smith sold Cruz the vehicle, its employee(s) “informed [him] that the Caravan was a safe vehicle and had no accident history.” They further alleged that “[i]n fact, the Caravan was not safe and had been in at least one accident prior to its sale to Cruz.” In granting Ricky Smith summary judgment on this claim, the hearing justice found that plaintiffs had produced “no facts [to] demonstrate[ ] that the salesperson knew at the time the statement was false.” 6', 'We agree with plaintiffs that “when Ricky Smith * * * began volunteering information as to the vehicle in question, it assumed a duty not to misinform [them].” In our view, however, the claim for negligent misrepresentation must fail because none of the evidence suggests that the statements about the vehicle’s condition were false when they were made. The record contains no evidence of the vehicle’s condition when it was sold.', 'Such evidence is necessary to demonstrate that Ricky Smith made “a misrepresentation of a material fact”—the first element of 6', 'The hearing justice did not fully state the appropriate inquiry, which is whether Ricky Smith’s employees knew or should have known that those statements were false when made. See Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1012 (R.I. 2007) (citing Mallette v. Children’s Friend & Service, 661 A.2d 67, 69 (R.I. 1995)).', '-9- a claim for negligent misrepresentation.

Tasca, 729 A.2d 707, 709 (R.I. 1999)). Standing alone, the fact that the airbags unexpectedly deployed in late 2001 does not mean that the vehicle was unsafe when it was sold three years earlier. Because plaintiffs did not establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with regard to their claim for negligent misrepresentation, the hearing justice properly granted summary judgment to Ricky Smith on this cause of action. See Papudesu, 18 A.3d at 497.', 'Finally, because we conclude that the hearing justice properly granted summary judgment in Ricky Smith’s favor on Nelson Cruz’s claims of negligence and misrepresentation, Elaine Cruz is necessarily barred from recovering damages for loss of consortium.

Indeed, it was not until June 21, 2007, when DHS initiated a phone call to the Warren Probate Court, that it learned that her estate had been opened.', 'On August 9, 2007, DHS filed a petition to file a claim out of time with the Warren Probate Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 33-11-5(b), seeking reimbursement for the medical assistance payments it had paid on Manchester’s behalf prior to her death. 3 In response, the estate filed a denial of that petition on August 15, 2007. Approximately three months later, on November 20, 2007, the Warren Probate Court granted DHS’s petition allowing it to file a claim out of time.', 'As a result, DHS then proceeded to file a claim and a notice of claim with the probate court, in response to which the estate filed its denial. Subsequently, counsel for DHS sent the 1', 'Those medical assistance payments were paid pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 through 1396v. 2', 'In a submission to the Superior Court, Steven A. Robinson, counsel for the estate, indicated that he is the successor administrator of Manchester’s estate. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 40-8-15(a) provides, in pertinent part, that “[u]pon the death of a recipient of medical assistance under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., the total sum of medical assistance so paid on behalf of a recipient who was fifty- five (55) years of age or older at the time of receipt of the assistance shall be and constitute[s] a lien upon the estate * * *.”', '-2- estate “print-outs of expenditures” documenting the medical assistance payments. On April 1, 2010, DHS filed a miscellaneous petition for sale of real property to satisfy that debt. 4', 'On October 14, 2010, the Warren Probate Court entered an order allowing the claim for the unpaid medical assistance benefits. The estate then appealed that order to the Providence County Superior Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 33-23-1. 5 In that appeal, the estate argued that the order was contrary to law. 6 In support of its appeal, the estate maintained that the claim for the reimbursement of medical assistance payments was barred by (1) G.L. 1956 § 9-1-21, which operates to extinguish all actions for or against a deceased person within three years of the date of death; and (2) § 33-11-50, which bars any suit by a creditor of a decedent made later than two years after the first publication date of the qualification of the estate’s representative. Accordingly, the estate contended that, because the claim was not filed within either of these two time frames, it was barred as a matter of law.', 'On April 29, 2011, the estate moved for summary judgment, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'In its accompanying memorandum, the estate maintained that the claim was time-barred in accordance with the above-referenced statutes. In response, DHS argued that, because a claim is a property interest protected by the Fourteenth 4', 'Such motions are usually made pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 33-12-4, which provides that: “If the personal property of a deceased person is insufficient to pay his or her debts, * * * his or her executor or administrator shall sell or mortgage for an amount decreed, in the manner provided in this chapter, so much of his or her real estate or of any interest in the real estate as may be subject to and required for the purpose of payments.” 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 33-23-1(a) provides that: “Any person aggrieved by an order or decree of a probate court * * * may * * * appeal to the [S]uperior [C]ourt for the county in which the probate court is established” by taking certain enumerated actions. 6', 'In his bench decision, the hearing justice incorrectly stated that the estate had appealed from a Warren Probate Court order dated November 14, 2007. It appears, though, that the estate appealed from the order of October 14, 2010, which the hearing justice correctly categorized as the order “granting [DHS’s] claim for reimbursement by the estate for medical assistance payments * * *.”', '-3- Amendment’s due process requirements, the estate’s failure to give notice that Manchester’s estate had opened for probate precluded it from raising the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. 7 Relying on precedent from this Court as well as the United States Supreme Court, it maintained that “[the] estate cannot thwart a legitimate claim using a statute of limitations defense if [it] has failed to give notice to * * * a known or reasonably ascertainable claimant.” See Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 491 (1988); see also In re Estate of Santoro, 572 A.2d 298, 301 (R.I. 1990). Following a hearing, a justice of the Superior Court denied the estate’s motion for summary judgment. 8 An order to that effect was issued on July 8, 2011.', 'DHS then separately moved for summary judgment. A hearing was held before another justice of the Superior Court on October 4, 2011. DHS maintained that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the prior hearing justice had rejected the estate’s argument that the claim was time-barred. Furthermore, addressing the merits, it maintained that the estate was precluded from arguing that the claim was time-barred because, in direct contravention of § 33-11-5.1, 9 it had failed to notify DHS that Manchester’s estate had been opened for probate. The hearing justice agreed. Relying on § 33-11-5(b), he reasoned that, because DHS had “lack of adequate notice of decedent’s estate,” it was not time-barred from presenting its claim against the estate. 7', 'DHS did not make a cross-motion for summary judgment. 8', 'A transcript of that hearing has not been provided to this Court on appeal. 9', 'In pertinent part, G.L. 1956 § 33-11-5.1(a) provides: “If the identity of a creditor of the decedent’s is known to or reasonably ascertainable by the personal representative, the personal representative shall, within a reasonable period of time after qualification, take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that such creditor receives or has received actual notice of the commencement of the decedent’s estate.”', '-4-', 'Further, the hearing justice found that § 9-1-21, which establishes a three-year statute of limitations in actions that arose prior to a decedent’s death, was “wholly inapplicable” to the case at bar because a claim for the reimbursement of medical expenses under § 40-8-15 “by its own terms cannot arise before the death of a medical assistance recipient.” Likewise, he found that § 33-11-50 was also inapplicable because it provided a two-year statute of limitation in suits by creditors of the decedent—not to claims presented to probate. Thus, neither of those statutes, the hearing justice determined, precluded DHS from filing its claim for the medical assistance payments. Having concluded that the claim was valid, he entered summary judgment in DHS’s favor on November 4, 2011. The estate then timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. Swain v. Tyre, 57 A.3d 283, 288 (R.I. 2012). “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Sansone v. Morton Machine Works, Inc., 957 A.2d 386, 393 (R.I. 2008)).', ""Additionally, when reviewing the meaning and applicability of a statute, this Court engages in a de novo review. Swain, 57 A.3d at 288. We have consistently held that “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, [we] must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Iselin v. Retirement Board of the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049 (R.I. 2008)). Further, we must presume that the General"", '-5- Assembly “intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning,” and, as such, we “will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” Swain, 57 A.3d at 288 (quoting State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 571 (R.I. 2009)).', 'III', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The estate assails the hearing justice’s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of DHS. It contends that he erred in holding that its failure to notify DHS of the opening of the probate estate precluded it from asserting a statute of limitations defense pursuant to § 33-11- 50. 10 In countering the estate’s contentions on appeal, DHS maintains that the hearing justice correctly ruled that the claim was valid and not time-barred under that statute. 11', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'Because our analysis hinges on the interplay between multiple statutes, we begin with a summary of those that apply to the facts at issue. DHS brought the claim for reimbursement of medical expenses pursuant to § 40-8-15(a), which provides a mechanism to obtain a lien on a deceased recipient’s estate for medical assistance. Section 40-8-15(a) further provides that “[t]he lien shall not be effective and shall not attach as against a recipient’s estate * * * unless [DHS] has filed a claim for reimbursement in the probate court in accordance with § 33-11-5 or other applicable law.” 10', 'It appears that the estate has abandoned its argument that G.L. 1956 § 9-1-21 also bars the claim. 11', 'In the alternative, DHS contends that, even if this Court were to find that § 33-11-50 applies to this case, the common law doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi (meaning: time does not run against the sovereign) operates to exempt DHS from abiding by that statute of limitations. See Searle v. Laraway, 27 R.I. 557, 559, 65 A. 269, 270 (1906). Because we ultimately find that DHS’s claim is not affected by § 33-11-50, we need not address this alternative argument.', '-6-', 'Turning then to § 33-11-5(a), DHS must have presented the claim at issue to the probate court within six months from the first publication of the commencement of the estate, subject to certain exceptions. Those exceptions allowed DHS to petition the probate court for leave to file its claim outside that six-month window if, among other things, it had not received “adequate notice of decedent’s estate.” Section 33-11-5(b). That exception is applicable here. Although the estate opened on June 10, 2004, DHS was not so notified until three years later, in June 2007. Two months later, in August 2007, DHS then appropriately petitioned the probate court to file a claim out of time.', 'Further, § 33-11-5.1(a) directs an estate’s personal representative to “take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that [a known or reasonably ascertainable] creditor receives or has received actual notice of the commencement of the decedent’s estate.” See also Estate of Santoro, 572 A.2d at 301 (“If a creditor’s identity is known or reasonably ascertainable, then the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause requires that the creditor be given * * * actual notice.”).', 'Although it is clear that DHS had the right to file its claim out of time, pursuant to § 33- 11-5(b), we must next consider whether § 33-11-50 bars that claim because it was not brought within two years from the date of first publication. Section 33-11-50 provides that: “No personal representative shall be held to answer to the suit of a creditor of the decedent * * * unless the suit is commenced within two (2) years from the date of the first publication * * *.” The estate argues that this statute operates to place a time limit on all claims filed against it. Thus, in its view, a claim filed out of the six-month window pursuant to § 33-11-5(b) must still be filed within the two-year time limit provided in § 33-11-50. We disagree.', 'Section 33-11-50 is inapplicable to the case at bar. That statute thwarts suits brought by the decedent’s creditors more than two years from the date of the publication, regardless of', '-7- whether the creditor has received any actual notice. Here, DHS did not file (and need not have filed) suit in order to seek reimbursement of the medical assistance benefits it had paid on Manchester’s behalf. Section 40-8-15(a) provides that the total sum of that medical assistance “shall * * * constitute a lien upon the estate * * * of the recipient in favor of [DHS],” which then becomes effective once DHS “has filed a claim for reimbursement in the probate court in accordance with § 33-11-5.”', 'Id. (emphasis added). Thus, DHS is permitted to obtain reimbursement for medical assistance by filing a claim in probate court, without the need to file suit in the Superior Court. Because the statute of limitations in § 33-11-50 applies only to suits and not to claims admitted to probate, as is the case here, we agree with the hearing justice that it did not bar DHS’s claim.', 'Since DHS sought reimbursement by filing a claim, rather than by filing suit, we look to § 33-11-5(a), which provides that “[c]laims shall be presented within six (6) months from the first publication or be forever barred, subject to extensions granted pursuant to subsection 33-11- 5(b).” As we previously held in Estate of Santoro, 572 A.2d at 301, a known or reasonably ascertainable creditor is not statutorily barred from filing a claim outside the above-referenced six-month statute of limitations if it did not receive actual notice of the commencement of probate. 12 Here, there is no dispute that DHS was a reasonably ascertainable creditor; in fact, it was a known creditor. Therefore, the statute of limitations was not triggered until June 21, 2007—the date it received notice that the estate had been opened. Because it filed its claim only two months after receiving notice—well within the above-referenced six-month window—its claim was not time-barred. 12', 'Following our holding in In re Estate of Santoro, 572 A.2d 298 (R.I. 1990), the General Assembly enacted § 33-11-5.1, which, as stated above, directs an estate’s personal representative to notify known or reasonably ascertainable creditors “to ensure that such creditor receives or has received actual notice of the commencement of the decedent’s estate.”', '-8-', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'In re Estate of May Manchester.

Caruolo, 524 A.2d 575, 579 (R.I. 1987).', 'As a matter of law, the exclusionary rule of Miranda does not apply unless the defendant (1) was in custody and (2) was interrogated. State v.

Accordingly, the admissibility of defendant‘s statement about the handcuffs hinges on whether defendant was in custody when Patrolman DeCecco asked him about the handcuffs. See Marini, 638 A.2d at 511.', 'The ―decisive test‖ for resolving the custody requirement is whether or not a person‘s ―freedom of movement is restricted to the degree associated with formal arrest.‖ Caruolo, 524 A.2d at 579.', 'The custody determination ―depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation.‖', 'Stansbury v.

We have stated that four factors may be considered when making this determination: ―(1) the extent to which the person‘s freedom [was] curtailed; (2) the degree of force employed by the police; (3) the belief of a reasonable, innocent person in identical circumstances; and (4) whether the person had the option of not accompanying the police.‖ Id. Finally, it is important to remember that ―custody as contemplated by Miranda does not exist merely because * * * the interrogated person is suspected of a crime or is the focus of a police investigation.‖ Caruolo, 524 A.2d at 579.', 'It is our view that the trial justice correctly determined that defendant was not in custody when Patrolman DeCecco asked him whether he owned handcuffs. He testified during the suppression hearing that defendant allowed the police to enter his apartment. See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 732 (ruling that the defendant was not in custody where two police officers ―were voluntarily admitted into the apartment‖). The interview then took place inside defendant‘s home. See United States v. Hughes, 640 F.3d 428, 435–36 (1st Cir. 2011) (recognizing that a suspect‘s home ―generally presents a less intimidating atmosphere than, say, a police station‖).', '- 15 - Patrolman DeCecco described the ―atmosphere‖ as ―not aggressive,‖ noting that defendant ―was compliant with‖ the police and ―was willing to answer the questions.‖ See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 733 (noting that the defendant in that case ―spoke calmly to [the police officer], voluntarily answering his questions without [the police officer] raising his voice or exerting any force over [the] defendant‖). Patrolman DeCecco‘s description was not contradicted. The officer further testified—again without contradiction—that he asked defendant only one question (viz., ―What happened tonight?‖) before posing the question about the handcuffs. See id. (holding that the defendant was not in custody even though he was questioned by police for forty-five minutes). There was also no evidence that Patrolman DeCecco had initiated any ―formal procedures * * * indicating that [the] defendant was under arrest or that his freedom was in any way restricted.‖ See id.', 'The defendant emphasizes the fact that the officers never explicitly told him that he was free to leave at any time. We have previously stated, however, that such silence is not a dispositive factor: ―the fact that [a] defendant was not informed * * * that he was free to leave does not change our determination that [the] defendant was not in custody.‖ Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 733; see also State v. Girard, 799 A.2d 238, 248 (R.I. 2002). The defendant further argues that he was in custody when the officers arrived because (1) Patrolman DeCecco had already completed paperwork memorializing his opinion that there was probable cause to arrest defendant and (2) Patrolman DeCecco stated that he made the decision to arrest defendant before he found handcuffs on the dresser. The motion justice, however, found that Patrolman DeCecco went to defendant‘s apartment ―to investigate to find out his side of the story,‖ and that, initially, an arrest ―was not the goal.‖ Instead, she found that the arrest was ―triggered‖ when Patrolman', '- 16 - DeCecco uncovered the handcuffs under the hat on the dresser. We perceive no basis for concluding that these findings were clearly erroneous.', 'Further, defendant‘s argument ignores the well-established principle that ―the initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.‖ See Stansbury, 511 U.S. at 323 (emphasis added). Accordingly, Patrolman DeCecco‘s unspoken probable cause analysis is irrelevant to determining whether or not defendant was in custody when Patrolman DeCecco asked him about handcuffs.', 'We recognize that the presence of four police officers in defendant‘s apartment made the scenario more coercive than it would have been if Patrolman DeCecco had arrived alone. Of course, ―a certain degree of coerciveness inheres in any police interrogation of a person suspected of a crime simply because of the aura of authority surrounding the interrogating officer * * *.‖ State v. Hobson, 648 A.2d 1369, 1371 (R.I. 1994); see also Hughes, 640 F.3d at 436 (noting that the presence of four officers in a ―small‖ home was ―impressive but not overwhelming‖).', 'That inherent coerciveness, however, does not transform every police interrogation into a custodial interrogation. See Hobson, 648 A.2d at 1371. Patrolman DeCecco testified that the officers went in a group out of concern for ―officer safety‖ and that officers ―seldom do anything by [them]selves‖ at night.', 'The trial justice found that Patrolman DeCecco‘s three fellow officers were positioned away from the bedroom during the interview, and she properly concluded that the distance ―made the atmosphere less coercive, not more coercive.‖ See Hughes, 640 F.3d at 436 (holding that a defendant was not in custody when there was ―nothing in the record to suggest that [four] officers either exploited [the home‘s] cozy confines or invaded the defendant‘s personal space‖).

As mentioned above, the hearing justice granted defendant‘s motion to suppress that evidence. The defendant‘s argument on appeal is limited to challenging the fact that the trial justice allowed Patrolman DeCecco to testify regarding defendant‘s admission that he owned handcuffs.', 'The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution ―prohibits a warrantless entry into a person‘s home to perfect an arrest or perform a search.‖ State v.

Further, the exclusionary rule applies to more than just physical evidence; the United States Supreme Court has long recognized that ―verbal evidence which derives so immediately from an unlawful entry * * * is no less the ‗fruit‘ of official illegality than the more common tangible fruits of the unwarranted intrusion.‖ Wong Sun v.

See Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 996 (―The Fourth Amendment prohibition against the warrantless entry into a person‘s home does not apply to situations in which voluntary consent has been obtained * * *.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)). The defendant instead argues that Patrolman DeCecco should have conducted the interview in the entryway of the 15-by-30-foot studio apartment rather than in the bedroom area. The defendant contends that Patrolman DeCecco ―had no right to enter [defendant‘s] bedroom without a warrant or consent‖ and that, since defendant admitted that he owned handcuffs while he was with the officer in the bedroom, the statement should have been suppressed.', 'The defendant bases his argument on the principle that the exclusionary rule applies ―when the giving of a statement is induced by confronting a suspect with illegally seized evidence.‖ See Jennings, 461 A.2d at 368. We are well aware of that sound principle; however, defendant has not explained how it applies to this case. During the trial, Patrolman DeCecco testified that he asked defendant whether he ―owned a pair of handcuffs.‖ He told the jury that defendant replied ―yes.‖ The defendant made this admission without being ―confront[ed] * * * with illegally seized evidence.‖ See id. At the time that he asked the question, Patrolman DeCecco had just come to defendant‘s apartment from the police station, where Ms. Bey had described an altercation that she had with defendant. She had told Patrolman DeCecco that defendant had handcuffed her against her will, and the patrolman stated that he had observed', '- 19 - redness and swelling on her wrists. Patrolman DeCecco‘s question to defendant about handcuffs naturally arose from his meeting with Ms. Bey. It was after defendant had already answered the patrolman‘s question that the handcuffs were discovered under the hat on the dresser.', 'The defendant allowed the police into his studio apartment and consented to an interview. He was asked a question about handcuffs and he freely gave an answer; the question was not prompted by ―illegally seized evidence,‖ nor was the answer induced by ―illegally seized evidence.‖ See Jennings, 461 A.2d at 368. After independently examining the record and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we conclude that the trial justice did not violate defendant‘s constitutional rights by allowing Patrolman DeCecco to testify regarding defendant‘s admission that he owned handcuffs.

Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006)) maintains that the ophthalmologist made these statements with the ―primary purpose of ‗establish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.‘‖ The defendant contends that, given the testimonial nature of the statements, Dr. Harper should not have been allowed to testify about the ophthalmologist‘s diagnosis because defendant did not have an opportunity to cross- examine the ophthalmologist.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'When a criminal defendant claims on appeal that the introduction of certain evidence violated his constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination, we review such an evidentiary ruling in a de novo manner.

Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1222 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant‘s sole contention on appeal is that he was deprived of his constitutional right of confrontation. Specifically, he argues that the trial justice should not have allowed Dr. Harper to testify about statements made by the ophthalmologist who treated Nashya on the night of the incident because defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine that ophthalmologist. It is our opinion, however, that defendant failed to preserve the right of confrontation issue for appellate review.', 'This Court has long adhered to the ―raise or waive‖ rule, pursuant to which ―an issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at trial is not properly preserved for appellate review.‖ See State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v.

We ―staunchly adhere[]‖ to this procedural principle. Figuereo, 31 A.3d at 1289. The rule is not ―some sort of artificial or arbitrary Kafkaesque hurdle.‖ DeMarco v.

Instead, the rule serves as an ―important guarantor of fairness and efficiency in the judicial process.‖ Id.', '-9-', 'In the context of challenging evidence offered at trial, we have repeatedly cautioned that ―a general objection is not sufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review; rather, assignments of error must be set forth with sufficient particularity to call the trial justice‘s attention to the basis of the objection.‖ Union Station Associates v.

Defense counsel uttered that word twice—on the first occasion, the objection was sustained; the second time, it was overruled. In neither instance, however, did defense counsel articulate the basis for his objection. Based on our well-settled ―raise or waive‖ rule, an objection without explanation is insufficient to preserve an issue on appeal. See Feliciano, 901 A.2d at 646 (―General objections to the admissibility of evidence, when the context does not supply the specific ground for the objection, are thus insufficient to preserve the issue.‖).', 'The defendant attempts to save his insufficient objection for appellate review by contending that ―it was clear that counsel was objecting to his inability to confront the doctor.‖ In our view, however, it is equally—if not more—plausible that the prosecutor and the trial', '- 10 - justice understood defendant‘s objection to be on hearsay grounds.7 See State v. Vieira, 38 A.3d 18, 25 (R.I. 2012) (rejecting appellant‘s argument that the grounds for an unspecified objection were ―clear from the context‖ and holding that an argument was waived where counsel ―failed * * * to articulate any basis whatsoever for her objection‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)). When defendant objected, Dr. Harper was about to testify regarding what the ophthalmologist had told her on the night of the incident.8 At an earlier point in Dr. Harper‘s testimony, defendant objected during a similar line of questioning when the prosecutor asked Dr. Harper about information she had learned from another emergency room resident. When defendant objected in that instance, the trial justice held a sidebar conference during which there was a colloquy regarding Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence—which sets forth the exception to the hearsay rule for ―[s]tatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.‖ It would have been entirely reasonable for the trial justice to have inferred that defense counsel had the same objection in mind when Dr. Harper was about to testify in a similar fashion regarding her conversation with the ophthalmologist.', 'The foundation laid by the prosecutor in between defendant‘s two bare objections also strongly suggests that the state was again seeking to avail itself of the hearsay exception set forth 7', 'A hearsay objection is not equivalent to an objection based on the constitutional right to confront a witness. See, e.g., United States v. Cabrera-Beltran, 660 F.3d 742, 751 (4th Cir. 2011) (―The hearsay objection at trial cannot be understood to include a Confrontation Clause objection.‖); United States v. Arbolaez, 450 F.3d 1283, 1291 n.8 (11th Cir. 2006) (―A hearsay objection to testimony at trial, standing alone, does not preserve a constitutional challenge under the Confrontation Clause for appeal.‖); United States v. Dukagjini, 326 F.3d 45, 60 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting that ―a hearsay objection would not in itself preserve a Confrontation Clause claim‖). 8', 'The question that led to the second objection reads as follows:', '―Q: And what did [the ophthalmologist] tell you.', '―DEFENDANT‘S ATTORNEY: Objection.', '―THE COURT: Overruled.‖', '- 11 - in Rule 803(4). After defendant‘s initial successful objection to the testimony regarding the ophthalmologist‘s findings, the prosecutor then asked Dr. Harper if the information provided by the ophthalmologist was necessary ―for the treatment of Nashya, as well as the diagnosis.‖ (Emphasis added.) Doctor Harper replied, ―Yes.‖ After this clarification, the prosecutor again asked Dr. Harper about her conversation with the ophthalmologist.', 'The defendant again objected, but this time the trial justice allowed Dr. Harper to answer. The just-summarized evidentiary foundation laid by the prosecutor tracked the hearsay exception found in Rule 803(4) (creating a hearsay exception for ―[s]tatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment‖ (emphasis added)). The defendant could have clarified his objection by articulating a right to confrontation argument, but he did not do so.', 'While it may be possible that defense counsel had the Confrontation Clause in mind, he made no reference to the same. Further, the foundation laid by the prosecutor shows that it is likely that both the prosecutor and the trial justice understood his objections to be on hearsay grounds. Ultimately, however, any journey into the mind of defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the trial justice amounts to speculation; it is a fruitless effort that brings to the fore the very purpose of the ―raise or waive‖ rule. We shall never know precisely why defendant objected to the line of questioning because he never articulated a reason to the court. See Tinney v. Tinney, 770 A.2d 420, 433 (R.I. 2001) (noting that a party may not ―raise an issue * * * on appeal that was not adequately raised below by presuming now the basis for the evidence‘s admission and tailoring his objection to that presumed basis‖). The defendant failed to adequately raise his constitutional argument at trial.', 'Our inquiry, however, is not over. We have recognized a ―narrow exception‖ to the ―raise or waive‖ rule. State v. Dennis, 29 A.3d 445, 449–50 (R.I. 2011). For the exception to', '- 12 - apply, ―the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.‖ State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001); see also State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987) (―[W]hen an intervening decision of this [C]ourt or of the Supreme Court of the United States establishes a novel constitutional doctrine, counsel‘s failure to raise the issue at trial will not preclude our review.‖). We hold that this narrow exception may not be invoked in this case because defendant‘s argument was not novel at the time Dr. Harper testified.', 'On March 8, 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).', 'The Crawford opinion abrogated the rule announced in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), which was the decision that previously provided the analytical framework for the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The Roberts Court had stated that ―an unavailable witness‘s out-of-court statement may be admitted so long as it has adequate indicia of reliability—i.e., falls within a ‗firmly rooted hearsay exception‘ or bears ‗particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.‘‖ See Crawford 541 U.S. at 42 (quoting Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66). After reviewing the historical underpinnings of the Confrontation Clause, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority in Crawford, described the Roberts rule as a ―framework * * * so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from even core confrontation violations.‖ Id. at 63.', 'The Court in Crawford recognized that the Roberts rule ―replac[ed] categorical constitutional guarantees with open-ended balancing tests,‖ which would ―do violence to their design.‖', 'Crawford, 541 U.S. at 67–68.', 'In order to maintain the integrity of the Sixth Amendment‘s guarantee, Crawford adopted a new analytical approach to be employed with', '- 13 - respect to evidentiary challenges based upon the Confrontation Clause: ―Where testimonial evidence is at issue, * * * the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.‖ Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68. The Court recognized that its decision did not ―articulate a comprehensive definition‖ of ―testimonial.‖ Id. at 68 n.10. It did, however, recognize a ―core class‖ of testimonial statements. Id. at 51–52.', 'The Supreme Court has stated that ―Crawford announced a new rule‖ of constitutional law. Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007); cf. State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 345 n.12 (R.I. 2005) (noting that ―Crawford probably constitutes a novel issue of law‖). However, defendant does not contend that the Crawford decision constitutes the sort of ―novel rule‖ pursuant to which the narrow exception to the ―raise or waive‖ rule may be invoked. Nor could he; Crawford was decided on March 8, 2004—more than two-and-a-half years before Dr. Harper gave her testimony.', 'Instead, defendant argues that two cases decided after Crawford—viz., Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009) and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011)— serve as ―intervening decision[s] * * * of the Supreme Court of the United States [that] establish[] a novel constitutional doctrine * * *.‖ See Burke, 522 A.2d at 731. In Melendez- Diaz, a defendant charged with a drug offense challenged affidavits provided by analysts at a state laboratory. The affidavits included forensic analysis, and they stated that the substance seized by the police in connection with the defendant‘s alleged crime was cocaine. The Supreme Court held that the affidavits were examples of ―testimonial evidence‖ under Crawford, recognizing that the sworn statements were ―made under circumstances which would lead an', '- 14 - objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.‖ Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 52).', 'Bullcoming involved a similar situation. In that case, the defendant was convicted of aggravated driving while intoxicated. At trial, the prosecution introduced a certified blood alcohol concentration report into evidence. However, it did so through the testimony of an analyst who had not conducted the actual forensic analysis. The Supreme Court held that such ―surrogate testimony * * * does not meet the constitutional requirement‖ of the Sixth Amendment. Bullcoming, 131 S. Ct. at 2710. The decision reiterated that the ―accused‘s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.‖ Id.', 'Both Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz merely apply the rule announced in Crawford. Therefore, those cases cannot be considered to have established a ―novel constitutional rule.‖ See Butler v. Curry, 528 F.3d 624, 634 (9th Cir. 2008) (―[W]hen a general rule must be applied in a new situation, it can hardly be thought to have created a new principle of constitutional law.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)). Crawford was the case that breathed new life into the Confrontation Clause. The Court announced a broad rule based on a ―categorical constitutional guarantee[]‖: ―Where testimonial evidence is at issue, * * * the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.‖ Crawford, 541 U.S. at 67, 68.', 'Certainly, at the time of defendant‘s trial, the Supreme Court had not established the precise contours of what is and what is not ―testimonial evidence.‖ That does not mean, however, that each Supreme Court case applying Crawford announces ―a novel constitutional rule.‖ The basic principle was established at the moment when Crawford was published: if a', '- 15 - prosecutor seeks to introduce evidence of testimonial statements where the defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, the defendant has a basis for objecting under the Sixth Amendment. Notably, the defendants in both Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming were sufficiently aware of the principle established by Crawford to object on those grounds at trial. See Bullcoming, 131 S. Ct. at 2712 (―Without Caylor‘s testimony, defense counsel maintained, introduction of the analyst‘s finding would violate Bullcoming‘s Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 309 (―Petitioner objected to the admission of the certificates, asserting that our Confrontation Clause decision in Crawford * * * required the analysts to testify in person.‖).', 'Bullcoming or Melendez-Diaz might have established a novel constitutional rule if Crawford had announced that only statements made to police constituted ―testimonial‖ statements. But Crawford contained no suggestion that the principle which it announced would be so limited. Indeed, the opinion included ―[v]arious formulations‖ of what the Court called a ―core class‖ of testimonial statements. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51.', 'Included among those formulations were ―statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.‖ Crawford, 541 U.S. at 52. The defendant‘s brief to this Court bases its argument on this category, noting that ―an objective witness [would] reasonably * * * believe that the resident‘s statements would be available for use at a later trial.‖ However, the conceptual basis for that precise argument was laid in Crawford—not in Melendez-Diaz or Bullcoming.', 'The defendant appears to conflate the concept of ―a novel constitutional rule‖ with an established constitutional rule that is applied to a novel fact pattern. For example, defendant argues that ―Melendez-Diaz was the first time that the Crawford line of case[s] had been applied', '- 16 - to what previously had been considered ‗neutral‘ scientific evidence not subject to the confrontation clause.‖', 'That may well be true, but the new application did not expand or otherwise alter the basic principle that was announced in Crawford. The majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz explicitly noted that the decision in that case constituted a ―rather straightforward application of [the Supreme Court‘s] holding in Crawford.‖ Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 312. Other courts have similarly stated that Melendez-Diaz did nothing more than apply Crawford to a different set of facts—a scenario that surely does not constitute ―a novel constitutional rule.‖ See, e.g., Peak v. Webb, 673 F.3d 465, 480 (6th Cir. 2012) (noting that Melendez-Diaz ―did not provide a new or novel interpretation of the Confrontation Clause‖); Hatley v.

Va. 2012) (―Bullcoming [and] Melendez–Diaz * * * merely clarify and apply Crawford‘s principles * * *.‖).', 'The ―narrow exception‖ to the ―raise or waive‖ rule applies to novel constitutional rules. It is not available when the Supreme Court applies a familiar constitutional rule to a novel fact pattern. If that were the standard, then virtually every constitutional decision of the Supreme Court would provide defendants an opportunity to take advantage of the exception. There would be nothing ―narrow‖ about such an outcome, nor would that outcome further the rule‘s purpose of ―fairness and efficiency in the judicial process.‖ See DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 628 n.55.

Therefore, this Court should have reached the merits of whether these out-of- court statements were testimonial in nature.', 'Although we ultimately conclude that those 9', 'Moten did object to the admission of this testimony on what could have been understood to be hearsay grounds, which the trial justice overruled. It is noteworthy that in a decision issued just before the trial in this case commenced, this Court left for another day the decision as to ―whether a defendant‘s unsuccessful objection to a statement on hearsay grounds alone would have preserved the Crawford issue for review on appeal.‖ State v.

Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 311 (2009).', 'Indeed, in Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 307, the Supreme Court was asked for the first time to identify whether ―affidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine * * * [we]re ‗testimonial,‘ [thereby] rendering the affiants ‗witnesses‘ subject to the defendant‘s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.‖', 'The Court held that the admission of those affidavits violated the defendant‘s right of confrontation because the affiants were not available for cross-examination.

In so holding, the Court reasoned that the affidavits were ―made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial * * *.‖ Id.', 'Although the Court stated that its holding ―involve[d] little more than the application of [the] holding in Crawford,‖ in reality, Melendez-Diaz was pivotal in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 329. In its wake, trial judges could do little more than ―guess what future rules th[e] Court w[ould] distill from the sparse constitutional text‖ of the Sixth Amendment. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 331 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Indeed, one year after Melendez-Diaz was decided, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts observed that the scope of the Confrontation Clause remained ―unsettled‖ and that Crawford‘s reach ―was, and remain[ed], vigorously debated.‖ Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 923 N.E.2d 524, 532 (Mass. 2010). We agree.', 'Two years after the decision in Melendez-Diaz, the United States Supreme Court decided Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011). There, the Court was asked to address whether the Sixth Amendment allowed ―the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not sign [a', '- 20 - testimonial] certification [of a forensic laboratory report concerning the blood alcohol concentration of the defendant] or personally perform or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.‖ Bullcoming, 131 S. Ct. at 2713. In holding that the defendant had a right to confront the analyst who actually certified that report, the Court cited Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 319-26, for support that ―[a]n analyst‘s certification prepared in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution * * * is ‗testimonial,‘ and therefore within the compass of the Confrontation Clause.‖ Bullcoming, 131 S. Ct. at 2713-14. The Court described its decision as ―in line with controlling precedent,‖ id. at 2713; however, the dissent maintained, correctly in our view, that ―[t]he persistent ambiguities in the Court‘s approach are symptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applications.‖ Id. at 2726 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).', 'Similarly, when Moten was tried in 2006, this Court had provided little guidance on the application of Crawford. In State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 642 (R.I. 2006)—decided a mere five months prior to Moten‘s trial—this Court stated: ―[W]e leave for another day the chore of fleshing out the extent to which the [United States] Supreme Court‘s elucidation of the Confrontation Clause otherwise affects our case law on the subject, if at all.‖ See also State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 345 n.12 (R.I. 2005) (―[T]he meaning of th[e] term [testimonial] will one day have to be more precisely defined by the courts.‖).', 'And so, we are now left to consider whether, at the time of Moten‘s trial—years before Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming applied Crawford‘s reach beyond statements made to police officers—defense counsel could have reasonably known that the admission of out-of-court statements made by one doctor to another regarding the results of a retinal eye examination potentially might violate Moten‘s right of confrontation. We conclude that, even if those cases did not clearly announce novel rules of law, they certainly employed novel applications to an', '- 21 - unsettled rule of law. In reading the holdings of Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming as mere applications of Crawford, the majority, in our opinion, does not sufficiently appreciate that both of those cases substantially expanded the scope of the Confrontation Clause.', 'Today, it is easy to conclude that competent defense counsel would raise an objection under the Confrontation Clause to the disputed portion of Dr. Harper‘s testimony, but we cannot say that Moten‘s counsel should have reasonably known that that objection would have been prudent at the time of his trial. See Breen, 767 A.2d at 57. Although it cannot reasonably be disputed that the exception to our ―raise or waive‖ rule is indeed a narrow one, we maintain that the majority effectively reads this exception out of our jurisprudence. The line between a novel rule of law and the application of a rule of law in a new context can sometimes be blurry, if not indistinguishable. We acknowledge that this is a close call, but we cannot fault defense counsel for his failure to forecast Crawford‘s application to the facts at issue.', 'Accordingly, we respectfully suggest that the majority should have addressed the Confrontation Clause issue as it relates to the disputed portion of Dr. Harper‘s testimony to determine whether the trial justice erred in admitting this testimony.', 'Application of the “Primary Purpose” Test', 'We now turn to the merits of Moten‘s Confrontation Clause challenge. Our inquiry focuses on whether the out-of-court statements made by the ophthalmologist to Dr. Harper concerning the results of a retinal eye test performed on the baby were testimonial in nature. Contending that those statements were testimonial, Moten ascribes error to the admission of that testimony.', 'The state counters that those statements did not violate Moten‘s right of confrontation, because Dr. Harper essentially testified to her own medical opinions and she was subject to cross-examination. As we noted above, guidance from the United States Supreme', '- 22 - Court on this issue has been less than clear. However, we set forth the law as best we can derive it from applicable precedent.', 'In determining whether the ophthalmologist‘s statements were testimonial, we employ the primary purpose test.

In so doing, we look to ―the circumstances in which the encounter occurs and the statements and actions of the parties.‖ Michigan v. Bryant, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 1156 (2011). If this inquiry reveals that the ophthalmologist‘s statements were made for the primary ―purpose of proving the guilt of a particular criminal defendant at trial‖ or ―to provide a solemn declaration for use at trial,‖ those statements would implicate the Confrontation Clause.

Although this Court has not yet had the opportunity to address the interplay between a statutory duty to report and the Confrontation Clause, we need not write on a blank slate. We agree with other jurisdictions that have held that a statutory duty to report does not necessarily render a statement testimonial under the Confrontation Clause. See, e.g., Seely v. State, 282 S.W.3d 778, 788 (Ark. 2008) (holding that a social worker‘s duty to report child abuse did not, by itself, render the child victim‘s statements testimonial); State v.

See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 310 (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52). In so doing, we must turn to the primary purpose of Dr. Harper‘s consultation with the ophthalmologist. See Bryant, 131 S. Ct. at 1157; see, e.g., State v. Justus, 205 S.W.3d 872, 880 (Mo. 2006) (holding that the primary purpose of an interview was to preserve testimony for a later criminal prosecution, thereby rendering the declarant‘s statements testimonial; interviewer knew that her interview was ―an official interview done for law enforcement‖ and interviewee was aware that her statements could be used to prosecute the defendant); State v.

See § 11-9-5.3(c)(4) (defining ―retinal hemorrhages‖ as one form of serious bodily injury).', 'It does not necessarily follow, however, that the primary purpose of the ophthalmologist‘s statements was to provide evidence of criminal conduct rather than to provide medical treatment. See Bryant, 131 S. Ct. at 1157. Moreover, there was no evidence that Dr. Harper contacted the ophthalmologist at the specific request of the police or DCYF.', 'In our view, the primary purpose of the ophthalmologist‘s examination was to determine the extent of the injuries to the baby for the purpose of rendering medical treatment. Doctor Harper testified that she was concerned with the baby‘s retinal bleeding, which could otherwise lead to blindness if left untreated.13 Indeed, she stated that the attending physician performed another eye examination on the baby the very next morning—as well as on several other occasions in the following weeks and months—because of the concern that retinal hemorrhages could damage the baby‘s eyesight.', 'Thus, even if it was known or suspected that the 13', 'Specifically, Dr. Harper testified that', '―once you have hemorrhages in the eye, it can keep you from', 'seeing well.

Rather, the primary purpose of the ophthalmologist‘s report was to resolve an ongoing medical emergency—to wit, damage to the baby‘s eye sight and the potential threat of blindness. Because the primary purpose of the ophthalmologist‘s statements was to resolve that emergency with proper medical treatment, thereby rendering the statements nontestimonial, we would conclude that their admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause.', 'Although we respectfully disagree with the majority‘s conclusion that Moten‘s Confrontation Clause challenge was not novel, and believe that the majority should have reached the merits of this issue, we ultimately conclude—after our own review of the merits—that the majority reached the proper result in affirming the judgment of conviction, because the evidence offered by Dr. Harper was nontestimonial.', '- 26 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

In this medical malpractice action, the defendant, Carl Schwartz, M.D. (defendant or Dr. Schwartz), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Paul Oden (Oden or plaintiff). On appeal, Dr. Schwartz argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.', 'Specifically, he asserts that the trial justice committed reversible error in (1) refusing to instruct the jury on intervening and superseding cause; (2) admitting certain testimony pertaining to Oden’s cardiac arrest following surgery in August 2004; (3) ignoring relevant and material evidence on the issue of damages; and (4) instructing the jury on insurance. Additionally, Dr. Schwartz contends that G.L. 1956 § 9-21- 10(b) (mandating prejudgment interest at a rate of 12 percent on pecuniary damages in medical malpractice actions) is unconstitutional—an issue of first impression for this Court. 1', 'After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The Rhode Island Association for Justice submitted an amicus brief to this Court, disagreeing with Dr. Schwartz’s contention that G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10(b) is unconstitutional.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Oden, who was fifty-six at the time of trial, underwent open-heart surgery at age forty- nine for a mitral valve replacement 2 at Rhode Island Hospital on January 26, 2004. Arun K. Singh, M.D. (Dr. Singh), a heart surgeon at Rhode Island Hospital, performed the surgery. Doctor Schwartz was the echocardiologist assisting Dr. Singh with that surgery. 3', 'Following the surgery, at a follow-up examination in March 2004, Oden’s cardiologist diagnosed him with severe aortic insufficiency (A.I.), 4 caused by an errant suture stitched by Dr. Singh during Oden’s January 2004 surgery. As a result, Oden was required to undergo a second open-heart surgery in August 2004, which was performed at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Immediately following that surgery, while in recovery, Oden suffered a cardiac arrest.', 'Oden then brought a medical malpractice action in the Providence County Superior Court against Rhode Island Hospital and Dr. Singh, alleging that he suffered damages attributable to their negligent conduct during his January 2004 surgery. 5 On January 17, 2007, while discovery on that action was pending, Oden brought a separate medical malpractice action against Dr. Schwartz. That action was later consolidated with the action against Dr. Singh and Rhode Island Hospital.

On October 20, 2010—the first day of trial—Dr. Schwartz moved to amend his answer to assert an affirmative defense of intervening and superseding cause, in which he alleged that Dr. Singh’s negligence was the superseding cause of Oden’s injuries. The trial justice reluctantly granted that motion. 6 A six-day jury trial then commenced. Below, we summarize the testimony and evidence presented.', 'A', 'Summary of the Testimony', 'Two expert witnesses testified for Oden: Stuart Pett, M.D., a heart surgeon; and Justin D. Pearlman, M.D., an expert in the field of echocardiography. Oden also called Dr. Singh to testify on his behalf. Doctor Schwartz testified on his own behalf and also called Adam B. Lerner, M.D., an anesthesiologist, to testify for him. Additionally, Oden and his wife, Linda, testified. 7 Because Dr. Singh performed the surgery at issue, we begin with his testimony.', 'Doctor Singh testified that he is board certified in general surgery, cardiac surgery, and thoracic surgery and that he has practiced at Rhode Island Hospital since 1975. 8 Of the 15,000 heart surgeries he has completed since then, about 2,000 were mitral valve replacement 6', 'At the conclusion of the trial, the trial justice later indicated that “[t]he only mistake I made in the case was allowing [Dr. Schwartz] to amend [his answer].” 7', 'The jury ultimately rejected Linda Oden’s claim for loss of consortium. Since the jury verdict with respect to that claim is not before us on appeal, we will not summarize Linda Oden’s testimony as to her loss of consortium claim, and we will refer to her testimony only as it is necessary to our analysis. 8', 'At the conclusion of Dr. Singh’s testimony, the trial justice instructed the jury that Oden and his wife had also sued Dr. Singh for medical malpractice, which was part of a separate proceeding. She further instructed the jury “not to concern [themselves] with the outcome of that lawsuit.”', '-3- surgeries, and approximately 800 were mitral valve repair surgeries. He stated that he has also performed approximately 2,000 aortic valve surgeries. He further testified that he has worked with Dr. Schwartz on hundreds of surgeries at Rhode Island Hospital since 1975.', 'Doctor Singh served as Oden’s surgeon at his mitral valve replacement surgery in January 2004. At that surgery, he mistakenly stitched Oden’s aortic valve, 9 which caused a leakage of that valve, referred to as “severe posteriorly directed [A.I.].” Consequently, Oden had to undergo a second open-heart surgery in August 2004. Doctor Singh stated that he was not aware of the A.I. until March 2004, when, at a follow-up examination, Oden’s cardiologist ordered a routine echocardiogram.', 'In explaining this error, Dr. Singh testified that he depends upon his surgical team (whom he identified as his assistant surgeon, physician assistant, scrub nurse, anesthesiologist/ echocardiologist, and perfusionist) to cooperate and assist him while he performs a mitral valve replacement surgery. He explained that, during this type of surgery, he is unable to see behind the mitral valve to determine whether he has placed an errant suture in sewing the replacement mitral valve.', 'Because of this, he further explained, the echocardiographer reviews an echocardiogram, 10 which reveals “how the heart is functioning, how the valve is functioning, [and] how the overall heart function is.” Since he is neither an expert in echocardiography nor board certified in echocardiography, he relies on the echocardiologist’s “[v]ery important” interpretation and evaluation of that testing, both before and during the open-heart surgery, which informs his ultimate decision to continue or end the surgery. 9', 'The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta of the heart. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary at 2086. 10', 'An echocardiogram is defined as “[t]he record obtained by echocardiography,” which means “[t]he use of ultrasound in the investigation of the heart and great vessels and diagnosis of cardiovascular lesions.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary at 608.', '-4-', 'Doctor Singh recalled that, during Oden’s surgery, Dr. Schwartz reviewed the results of the echocardiograph and informed him that the “valve function prosthesis was working normal[ly][—]like [it was] supposed to do.” When asked on direct examination whether “there [was] any change in Mr. Oden’s aortic valve function” after he had replaced the mitral valve, he stated: “If I recall, there wasn’t anything.” According to Dr. Singh, the mitral valve was not leaking, and “was functioning normal[ly] after the replacement.” In sum, he maintained that “[a]t the time of surgery” he did not have “reason to believe” that there was a new problem with either the mitral or aortic valve. In fact, he believed that “[i]t was a successful surgery with no complications.” He further acknowledged that “[h]ypothetically * * * if [he] became aware that Dr. Schwartz was not able to evaluate the heart by echocardiograph,” he would have asked him “to look for it and evaluate it properly or get help.”', 'Moreover, Dr. Singh acknowledged that if he had learned something “of medical consequence” during the surgery, he would have documented it in Oden’s medical record. He then confirmed that Oden’s medical record revealed that there were no problems whatsoever with the mitral valve replacement surgery.', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Singh’s testimony changed somewhat regarding whether he was aware of any new problems involving Oden’s aortic valve. He admitted that, “when Mr. Oden left the operating room [after Dr. Singh performed the January 2004 surgery], [he] w[as] aware that [Oden] had mild aortic regurgitation” (which he later clarified was synonymous with mild A.I.). He testified that, after learning this, he weighed a number of factors in deciding not to put Oden back on bypass. In an effort to impeach that inconsistent testimony, on redirect examination, Oden’s counsel confronted Dr. Singh with his earlier deposition testimony. In that deposition, when asked whether he was “told by [Dr. Schwartz] that there was possibly more', '-5- aortic regurgitation in Mr. Oden’s heart after [he] performed [the] surgery than was present before [he] performed it,” Dr. Singh had responded, “[n]o, no.”', 'Moreover, on redirect examination, he stated that, even if he had been told by Dr. Schwartz that A.I. was present, he would also have needed to know “the potential cause of the [A.I.].” He claimed, though, that at the time of the surgery, he knew the cause of the A.I. “most likely was distortion.”', 'Doctor Schwartz testified that he had a “vague memory” regarding the presence of A.I. during Oden’s open-heart surgery, but that it was his “best recollection” that he advised Dr. Singh of the A.I. at the conclusion of the mitral valve replacement. He admitted that he failed to document the A.I. in the medical record. “[I]n a perfect academic world,” he testified, it would have been so documented. In any event, he stated that, he makes decisions in the operating room “in real time and not by coming back later to see what the [medical] record had showed.” He acknowledged that, in this case, he “did not do a totally detailed exam” of the aortic valve; however, he felt that the exam he had performed was “adequate” in determining that there was A.I., which he had communicated to Dr. Singh.', 'Doctor Schwartz explained that the surgeon is the head of the surgical team in the operating room, and, as such, makes decisions as to whether or not additional procedures will be performed on a patient. The standard of care dictates that he and other members of the surgical team must defer to the surgeon’s decisions in this regard. Doctor Schwartz testified that he advised Dr. Singh, the head surgeon, that there was mild A.I. He further testified that Dr. Singh, having been given this information, ultimately decided “to proceed [to] get [Oden] off bypass [because] [Oden] ha[d] a very sick heart.” According to Dr. Schwartz, Dr. Singh further told him that it was just “[m]ild A.I.,” which he was “not concerned about” because “[p]eople can live for many years with mild A.I. before they get symptomatic or have problems.” In response,', '-6- Dr. Schwartz followed Dr. Singh’s orders by “continu[ing] to take care of [Oden] and get [him] out of the operating room alive.” Without Dr. Singh’s order for “more information,” Dr. Schwartz testified that he was not required to do anything more than advise Dr. Singh of any findings from the echocardiogram.', 'As stated above, Oden also called Dr. Pett, an expert in heart surgery, to testify regarding whether Dr. Singh and Dr. Schwartz deviated from the applicable standard of care in performing Oden’s mitral valve replacement surgery in January 2004 and the consequences therefrom. Consistent with Dr. Singh’s testimony, his review confirmed that, when Dr. Singh had stitched the newly-replaced mitral valve during surgery, he “went outside the field of where [the stitches] should have been.” In so doing, Dr. Singh negligently bound the adjacent aortic valve (located approximately two to four millimeters from the mitral valve). Because the medical record characterized the surgery as “being without incident,” Dr. Pett concluded that both doctors directly contravened the standard of care, which “absolutely required [them] to give a comprehensive accurate documentation” of any complications that arose during the surgery.', 'As had Dr. Singh, Dr. Pett testified that, following the replacement of the mitral valve, the surgeon depends upon the echocardiographer to evaluate the surgery, and, among other things, to “make sure that the valves are opening and closing okay.” According to Dr. Pett, the standard of care dictates that, during this evaluation, the echocardiographer must “always check the aortic valve” and inform the surgeon of any problems. If the aortic valve has been bound down or injured by an errant suture, the standard of care requires that the surgeon “fully evaluate[ ] and characterize[ ] * * * that injury” to decide how to fix the injured valve. At that point, the injured valve can either be “repaired or replaced” by placing the patient “back on bypass.”', '-7-', 'Doctor Pett further testified that, if Dr. Schwartz, in fulfilling his duty to evaluate Oden’s heart during surgery, had informed Dr. Singh about the injured aortic valve, the standard of care would have required Dr. Singh to place him back on bypass to perform an inspection to determine the best course of action. According to Dr. Pett, as a result of the failure to diagnose and fix the injured aortic valve during the January 2004 surgery, Oden had to undergo a second open-heart surgery in August 2004 to replace his aortic valve. Indeed, he testified that “[i]f [the damage to Oden’s aortic] valve had been addressed at the first surgery * * * the second surgery wouldn’t have been done.” He stated that the close proximity in time between the two surgeries (less than seven months) was “not optimal” because, at the time of the second surgery, Oden’s tissues would still have been “quite swollen [and] fragile.” Consequently, this caused a situation where “getting the anatomy out [in the second surgery] [was] dangerous.” He further testified that shortly after the completion of the second surgery while still in recovery, Oden suffered a cardiac arrest, which required him “to be cardioverted or shocked back into a viable rhythm.”', 'Doctor Pett testified that Oden’s risk of death had increased as a result of having received two artificial valves (the mitral and the aortic).', 'Each valve has an approximate life of ten to fifteen years. 11', 'Oden was forty-nine years old at the time of his surgeries; thus, he will eventually need to undergo additional surgery to replace both of them when he is between sixty and sixty-five years old.', 'Oden also called Dr. Pearlman, an expert in echocardiography, to testify. His testimony centered on the standard of care for echocardiographers during a mitral valve replacement surgery. He ultimately concluded that “Dr. Schwartz * * * deviate[d] from th[at] standard of 11', 'Doctor Pett testified that a replaced aortic valve “lasts maybe two or three years longer on the average than the mitral.”', '-8- care in several regards.” Additionally, he testified that the aortic valve replacement surgery in August 2004 increased Oden’s risk of blood clots, stroke, infections in the heart, and death.', 'He stated that, before a mitral valve replacement surgery, the echocardiographer must do a “completed study which takes stock of the function of the heart and the valves and gets detailed views on each valve * * * to establish the baseline condition of the patient prior to [the mitral valve replacement].” After the mitral valve replacement, but before the surgery is complete, the echocardiographer must “make sure that [the replacement] was done reasonably well; that it was effective, and also * * * rule out harm from the procedure.” In so doing, the echocardiographer “look[s] at the function of the heart, look[s] at the function of the replaced valve, and also look[s] at the nearby structures, including the aortic valve.”', 'According to Dr. Pearlman, the echocardiographer also has a responsibility to communicate to the surgeon any changes he observes.', 'Consistent with the testimony of Dr. Pett, Dr. Pearlman testified that Dr. Schwartz deviated from the standard of care by failing to document the A.I. in Oden’s medical record. Further, Dr. Pearlman took issue with Dr. Schwartz’s deposition testimony, in which he stated that he had diagnosed the A.I. after the mitral valve replacement, and communicated this finding to Dr. Singh. In rejecting that deposition testimony, Dr. Pearlman concluded that Dr. Schwartz improperly relied on an “indirect view” of the aortic valve in reviewing the echocardiogram, which was not adequate information for such a diagnosis. In Dr. Pearlman’s opinion, Dr. Schwartz’s failure to conduct a detailed study of the aortic valve meant that he could not have properly communicated the purported finding of A.I. to Dr. Singh.', 'Doctor Lerner, the director of the cardiac anesthesia division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, testified for Dr. Schwartz. He testified that Dr. Schwartz met the', '-9- standard of care required of an echocardiographer in conducting the test, in which he determined that there was A.I. He further testified that Dr. Schwartz met the standard of care by advising Dr. Singh of the A.I.; however, he stated that Dr. Schwartz fell short of the standard of care in failing to document the A.I. in the medical record. On cross-examination, he acknowledged that his opinion that Dr. Schwartz had followed the standard of care was based on Dr. Schwartz’s deposition testimony, in which he stated that he had told Dr. Singh about the A.I. at the time of Oden’s surgery.', 'Oden’s testimony primarily centered on his claimed damages. The record reveals that he had some difficulty speaking due to a stroke he had suffered in March 2006. Because of this, the trial justice instructed the jury “that there’s no claim * * * over th[at] stroke * * *.”', 'Oden confirmed that he was “not able to get on with his life” after the January 2004 surgery because, in its wake, he soon learned that he had to gear up for a second open-heart surgery. While still in recovery after the second surgery, he testified that he suffered a cardiac arrest, in which his “heart stopped.” At that point, a nurse used an “electronic shocker” to revive him. He recalled that this was “the wors[t] pain [he] ever felt.” He testified that he had experienced pain since the second surgery, including pain in his chest. Knowing that he will soon have to endure a third surgery “makes [him] sad” and affects his mood. He further testified that the risks associated with that looming surgery cross his mind often.', 'On cross-examination, Oden acknowledged that, after his second surgery, he told his cardiologist that he felt well, although he had some chest wall discomfort.', 'Oden further acknowledged that, in December 2005, approximately sixteen months after the second surgery, his cardiologist had reported that he felt “excellent”—“[a]lmost too good.”', 'Oden further testified that he continues to indulge in a “little bit of drinking” but that he does not get drunk.', '- 10 - He acknowledged that before these surgeries he would sometimes drink “six beers” in a day, and that the next day “it could be two beers” or “three beers.” He further acknowledged that he continued to smoke cigarettes occasionally, although he “[didn’t] really know” the quantity he smoked.', 'B', 'Jury Charge and Jury Verdict', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial justice held a charging conference with counsel. At that conference, she addressed, among other things, whether she would issue a charge on intervening and superseding cause. After hearing arguments from counsel, she stated that she was “pretty sure” she would not do so.', 'The next day, the trial justice gave her closing instructions to the jury. 12 Included in those very thorough instructions was a charge on insurance, in which she stated:', '“I want to speak about one other thing, and I find it’s best to', 'directly speak about this, to discuss it openly. My experience is', 'that jurors are often tempted to speculate about things such as', 'medical insurance or other types of insurance or benefits. Jurors', 'also wonder about the attorneys[’] fees, who pays them, how much', 'they will be. Jurors also wonder about what might happen to a', 'physician’s insurance premiums. I am specifically instructing you', 'that you must not consider any of these things in deciding the case', 'or determining what amount, if any, you will award for damages.', 'If you were to speculate about insurance[ ] or attorneys[’] fees,', 'how much they might be or who will pay them, then you would be', 'speculating about things that are not part of the evidence, things', 'that the law says you must not consider and things about which', 'you could only be guessing. If you were to try to consider,', 'compensate for, or adjust for any of these things, you would be', 'ignoring your duties as jurors. Worse, you could very likely cause', 'a result or outcome that you don’t intend. The law and the [c]ourt 12', 'Prior to instructing the jury, the trial justice did not give counsel a complete copy of her instructions. Although there is no mandate that a trial justice do so, presenting counsel with the complete written instructions prior to charging the jury may be helpful. This operates to prevent any element of surprise, which in turn may reduce appeals from those jury charges.', '- 11 -', 'have rules that govern these matters. They are not matters for', 'jurors.” Also, as she had previously indicated to counsel, she did not instruct the jury on intervening and superseding cause.', 'Immediately following the trial justice’s charge to the jury, Dr. Schwartz objected to her failure to instruct on intervening and superseding cause, as well as the instruction on insurance. With respect to the insurance charge, he averred that “black letter law” dictates that interjecting the issue of “insured risk” into the case is forbidden. In response, the trial justice stated that she “always give[s] a cautionary instruction on insurances, insurance premiums, benefits, things like that.” Because there was “so much media coverage” on this subject, she deemed it “important to tell jurors that they mustn’t consider” insurance as a factor in deciding the merits of the case. The trial justice reasoned: “It’s a fact of life that everyone has insurance;” accordingly, she concluded that she had not “raised anything that the[ ] jurors don’t know about.”', 'Before the jury retired to deliberate, Dr. Schwartz moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 13 The trial justice deferred her ruling on that motion until the jury reached its verdict. After less than a full day of deliberations, the jury returned a $1.5 million-dollar verdict in Oden’s favor. It found that Dr. Schwartz was 25 percent responsible for Oden’s injuries and that Dr. Singh was 75 percent responsible for those injuries. Thus, Dr. Schwartz was deemed responsible for $375,000 of those 13', 'In pertinent part, Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states that “[i]f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.”', '- 12 - damages, plus costs and statutory interest. Additionally, the jury rejected Linda Oden’s loss of consortium claim.', 'C', 'Posttrial Motions', 'After the verdict was announced, the trial justice conducted a hearing on Dr. Schwartz’s Rule 50 motion, which she denied. 14 On December 13, 2010, final judgment entered for Oden in the amount of $375,000, plus statutory interest of $170,260.27. In a later order, the trial justice additionally awarded costs in favor of Oden in the amount of $4,416.50. Doctor Schwartz then moved for a new trial, pursuant to Rule 59(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and he also moved to vacate, alter, or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e). Specifically, in his motion for a new trial, Dr. Schwartz averred that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and that the trial justice erred in (1) refusing to instruct the jury on intervening and superseding cause; (2) introducing the concept of liability insurance in her jury instructions; and (3) permitting evidence of Oden’s cardiac arrest following his second surgery. In his motion to vacate, alter, or amend the judgment, Dr. Schwartz challenged the constitutionality of the award of prejudgment interest pursuant to § 9-21-10(b).', 'He further contended that the damages awarded were not supported by the evidence, and he therefore asked for a remittitur.', 'The trial justice denied both of Dr. Schwartz’s Rule 59 motions at a hearing on February 17, 2011. An order to that effect was entered on February 24, 2011. In so ruling, the trial justice independently reviewed and summarized the trial testimony. The trial justice found Dr. Pett to be credible; his testimony, she concluded, “made sense.” She noted that Dr. Pett “remained 14', 'Following that decision, Oden moved for costs, pursuant to Rule 54(d) and (e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Because neither of the decisions on those motions is before us on appeal, we do not discuss them.', '- 13 - adamant that the echocardiographer must fully characterize the problem when [A.I.] is spotted.” Moreover, she credited Dr. Pett’s testimony that, “if Dr. Schwartz had done his job and fully evaluated and characterized the injury, it would have been discovered that Mr. Oden’s aortic [valve] was bound down. * * * [T]his problem could have been corrected during that same surgery, thus avoiding the second surgery * * *.”', 'Next, the trial justice reviewed the testimony provided by Dr. Pearlman, whom she also considered to be credible. She found that his testimony was consistent with that of Dr. Pett, in which he stated that Dr. Schwartz did not properly investigate and document the A.I.', 'With respect to Dr. Singh, the trial justice found him “generally” not credible, and “not at all credible” when, on cross-examination, he suddenly recalled the details of a conversation he had with Dr. Schwartz in the operating room, in which he testified that he had learned of “some aortic insufficiency.” Further, the trial justice remarked, Dr. Singh’s “motive to fabricate was obvious” and his “physical demeanor while on the witness stand only further impaired his credibility.”', 'Doctor Schwartz, the trial justice determined, “wasn’t any more credible than Dr. Singh.” Indeed, she found his explanation about his failure to document the A.I. in the medical record, while otherwise discussing it with Dr. Singh, to be “quite lame.” Further, the trial justice found that Dr. Schwartz’s testimony, in which he stated that he reported his finding of A.I. to Dr. Singh and that, notwithstanding that report, Dr. Singh told him not to pursue it, was not credible.', 'The trial justice found Oden to be “credible enough,” since “[t]he medical records and common sense backed him up” when he testified about his pain, discomfort, anxiety, and sadness. She further found Linda Oden’s testimony to be “quite credible,” stating that her testimony corroborated that provided by Oden.', '- 14 -', 'Lastly, she examined Dr. Lerner’s testimony. It appears that she did not make a specific finding on his credibility.', 'She determined, though, that Dr. Lerner simply “assumed Dr. Schwartz was telling the truth” about reporting the A.I. to Dr. Singh.', 'The trial justice also ruled on Dr. Schwartz’s objection to her failure to instruct the jury on intervening and superseding cause. In explaining her decision not to instruct the jury on this theory, the trial justice stated that “[Dr.] Singh’s negligence could hardly be said to be independent such that it cut off Dr. Schwartz’s antecedent negligence and took over as the sole proximate cause of the harm done, thus rendering [Dr.] Schwartz’s negligence totally inoperative.” Further, the two doctors’ roles, she explained, were “inextricably intertwined” because they operated as part of a surgical team. As such, Dr. Singh’s second act of negligence (failing to follow up with Dr. Schwartz concerning the A.I.) “was hardly independent of [Dr.] Schwartz’s antecedent negligence” (failing to discover and investigate the A.I.).', 'The trial justice also concluded that she was “correct in cautioning the jury about insurance[ ] and attorneys[’] fees.” “The average citizen is aware,” she explained, “that many patients have health or some other kind of insurance, * * * that litigants have to pay legal fees, * * * [and] that professionals, including physicians, are required to pay for liability insurance.” Moreover, since this instruction took only about thirty seconds of an over two-hour-long final instruction, she concluded that the charge concerning insurance and attorneys’ fees “hardly prejudiced [the] jury.”', 'She further determined that the “verdict does not shock the conscience.” In support of this finding, she maintained that, as a result of the two doctors’ negligence, Oden’s life expectancy had been reduced and he “lost an important body part.” Moreover, she stated, his pain and suffering was “significant” and the “mental suffering attendant to knowing what he', '- 15 - faces in the future as well as the knowledge of his reduced life expectancy would have to be substantial.”', 'Addressing Dr. Schwartz’s constitutional challenge to the statutory prejudgment interest rate, she rejected his contention that the right to a jury trial triggers strict scrutiny; rather, she reasoned, the correct test to be applied was the rational basis test. Since awarding prejudgment interest promotes settlement and compensates plaintiffs for the loss of their money while cases are pending, she concluded that the statute passed constitutional muster under a rational basis analysis. Furthermore, she stated that having a uniform prejudgment interest rate “ensures certainty in the calculation of final judgments.”', 'Lastly, the trial justice explained that she did not err in permitting the jury to consider testimony concerning Oden’s cardiac arrest following his second surgery.', 'She stated that “[t]here was evidence that the second surgery was causally connected to Dr. Schwartz’s negligence and that Mr. Oden’s heart stoppage was merely a complication of that surgery.” She further concluded that Dr. Schwartz was not prejudiced by the fact that the jury learned that Oden had suffered a stroke, since “[t]here was evidence that he had recovered well from his surgeries.” Moreover, she continued, “there was no claim that the stroke was related to the valve replacement surgery.” 15', 'Ultimately, the trial justice concluded that “reasonable minds could have reached differing results with this evidence;” accordingly, she denied Dr. Schwartz’s Rule 59 motions. Further, she explained, “neither [Dr. Singh nor Dr. Schwartz] was credible and the medical records are devoid of any indication that the two spotted, much less discussed, any [A.I.].” 15', 'The trial justice explained that she usually does not revisit evidentiary rulings in a motion for a new trial, but that, in this case, she would address those rulings since Oden’s counsel, out of an abundance of caution, had specifically asked her to do so.', '- 16 - Following the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial and his motion to amend, vacate, or alter the judgment, Dr. Schwartz timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Doctor Schwartz raises a number of issues in support of his appeal. First, he contends that the trial justice erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of intervening and superseding cause. Second, he argues that the trial justice erred by admitting evidence of Oden’s cardiac arrest immediately following his second surgery. Third, he maintains that the trial justice ignored relevant and material evidence on the issue of damages. Fourth, he avers that the trial justice committed an error of law by instructing the jury on the issue of liability insurance. Lastly, he asserts that § 9-21-10(b) is unconstitutional because the 12 percent prejudgment interest rate deprives litigants of both substantive and procedural due process. We address each issue in turn. Because each of the issues on appeal is subject to differing standards of review, we recite each standard as we examine each issue below.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Instruction on Intervening and Superseding Cause', 'Doctor Schwartz first claims that the trial justice erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of intervening and superseding cause. Doctor Schwartz argues that, even if he did not obtain sufficiently detailed views of the aortic valve in the echocardiogram, this negligence was trumped by Dr. Singh’s failure to sufficiently evaluate the aortic valve at the time Dr. Schwartz alerted him to the A.I. Thus, Dr. Singh’s negligence constitutes an independent intervening force', '- 17 - sufficient to break the causal connection between Dr. Schwartz’s antecedent negligence and the harm to Oden.', 'When this Court is called upon to review “issues pertaining to jury instructions, we do so de novo.” State v. Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010). We emphasize that intervening and superseding cause is an affirmative defense. Estate of Fontes v. Salomone, 824 A.2d 433, 438 (R.I. 2003). Thus, Dr. Schwartz had the burden of proof to introduce sufficient evidence to form the basis for this instruction. See id. Our independent review of the record shows that he failed to do so.', ""“Intervening cause exists when an independent and unforeseeable intervening or secondary act of negligence occurs, after the alleged tortfeasor’s negligence, and that secondary act becomes the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.” Seide v. State, 875 A.2d 1259, 1270 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Contois v. Town of West Warwick, 865 A.2d 1019, 1027 (R.I. 2004)). As such, “the condition created by the first actor is merely a circumstance and not the proximate cause of the accident.” Pantalone v. Advanced Energy Delivery Systems, Inc., 694 A.2d 1213, 1215 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Walsh v. Israel Couture Post, No. 2274 V.F.W., 542 A.2d 1094, 1097 (R.I. 1988)). However, “an intervening act of negligence will not insulate an original tortfeasor if it appears that such intervening act is a natural and probable consequence of the initial tortfeasor's act.” Walsh, 542 A.2d at 1097. Furthermore, “[i]f * * * the intervening cause was not reasonably foreseeable, the intervening or secondary act becomes the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries.” Id. (quoting Almeida v. Town of North Providence, 468 A.2d 915, 917 (R.I. 1983))."", 'Although the trial justice allowed Dr. Schwartz to amend his answer on the first day of trial to assert an affirmative defense of intervening and superseding cause, the trial justice', '- 18 - ultimately decided that she would not instruct the jury regarding this defense. We do not disagree with her decision in that regard because based on the facts of this case it would have been improper to so instruct the jury. In her decision denying Dr. Schwartz’s motion for a new trial on this issue, she stated:', '“[T]hese physicians were part of a surgical team whose duties and', 'functions are intertwined[.] * * * [E]ach owed an independent', 'duty to [this] patient[.] * * * There are plenty of things that can', 'go wrong with something as complex as heart surgery. * * * That', 'one team member failed to perform as required shouldn’t relieve', 'the other team member of his duties. These physicians’ duties ran', 'parallel. * * * Even assuming [Dr.] Singh was negligent in not', 'asking for more information, * * * [Dr.] Singh’s negligence could', 'hardly be said to be independent such that it cut off Dr. Schwartz’s', 'antecedent negligence * * *.”', 'She further reasoned that, “if [Dr.] Schwartz was not required to anticipate [Dr.] Singh’s negligence, [then] [Dr.] Singh was not required to anticipate [Dr.] Schwartz’s negligent failure to perform the requisite studies and to alert him to any problems.” She continued, “[i]f anything, this is a situation in which one physician’s duty includes guarding against the mistakes of another, even if those mistakes may be the result of negligence.” Since both Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Singh were operating as part of a surgical team, their “roles and responsibilities were inextricably intertwined.” As such, “to attempt to reduce an open heart surgery and the roles of the [doctors] to a question of who performed the last act * * * makes no sense.” We agree.', 'An instruction on intervening and superseding cause is not proper in every case where there is harm caused by two negligent tortfeasors. It is the duty of the trial justice to decide, as a matter of law, whether the alleged negligence of the second tortfeasor was independent of the first tortfeasor. Thus, a jury instruction on intervening and superseding cause should only be given where the trial justice makes such a finding. Only if the trial justice determines that the negligence of the second tortfeasor (in this case, Dr. Singh) was independent of that of the first', '- 19 - (in this case, Dr. Schwartz) must the jury be instructed to decide whether that independent negligence was foreseeable to the first tortfeasor. Based on our review of the record, we cannot say that the trial justice erred in this regard. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice was correct in refusing to instruct on intervening and superseding cause.', 'B', 'Admission of Testimony Pertaining to Oden’s Post-Operative Cardiac Arrest', 'Doctor Schwartz next avers that the trial justice erred in allowing testimony pertaining to Oden’s cardiac arrest following his second open-heart surgery. In support of this contention, he asserts that “there was no testimony from any witness competent to opine that Mr. Oden’s post- operative cardiac arrest in August of 2004 had anything whatsoever to do with * * * any act or omission on the part of Dr. Schwartz in connection with the surgery in January of 2004 * * *.” Moreover, he further asserts that “the record [wa]s entirely devoid of any basis” for Oden’s testimony that, as a result of the cardiac arrest, he experienced the “worst pain” of his life. Doctor Schwartz maintains that the cardiac arrest was nothing more than a consequence of Oden’s “established long-standing nicotine and alcohol abuse.”', 'Refuting those contentions, Oden maintains that there was, in fact, expert testimony on this point. In support of this assertion, Oden cites Dr. Pett’s testimony, in which he stated that “shortly after the completion of the [second] surgery, Mr. Oden arrested and needed to be cardioverted or shocked back into a viable rhythm. * * * If his [aortic] valve had been addressed at the first surgery, * * * the second surgery wouldn’t have been done. * * * [And he would have avoided] the [cardiac] arrest.”', 'We discern no error with respect to the trial justice’s allowance of testimony regarding the post-operative cardiac arrest. Doctor Pett testified that there was a nexus between the cardiac', '- 20 - arrest and the negligence of Dr. Schwartz in connection with the January 2004 surgery. We therefore conclude that there was enough evidence to suggest that a causal relationship existed between the cardiac arrest and Dr. Schwartz’s negligence at the first surgery, such that the admission of testimony concerning the cardiac arrest was proper. See Perry v. Alessi, 890 A.2d 463, 467 (R.I. 2006). Moreover, we find Dr. Schwartz’s argument that the cardiac arrest was a consequence of Oden’s consumption of alcohol and nicotine to be unavailing. We agree with the trial justice that “there’s absolutely no evidence to suggest that [his post-operative cardiac arrest] was caused by something independent of the * * * second surgery itself.” In any event, Dr. Schwartz was able to make that argument to the jury, and the jury weighed that evidence accordingly. We are satisfied that the testimony concerning the cardiac arrest was proper.', 'C', 'Denial of Defendant’s Request as to the Damage Award', 'Doctor Schwartz also ascribes error to the trial justice’s denial of his request for a remittitur and his motion to vacate, alter, or amend the damage award, asserting that the jury verdict “fails to respond truly to the merits of the controversy, fails to administer substantial justice, and is against the fair weight of the evidence.” Doctor Schwartz contends that the jury verdict did not accurately respond to Oden’s showing, or lack thereof, of any pain and suffering. As such, Dr. Schwartz asserts that the trial justice “overlooked the simple fact that, although Mr. Oden ‘faces additional high risk surgery,’ he would have [had] to face this surgery even if Dr. Singh had not sutured his aortic valve in January of 2004.”', 'Since the approximate life expectancy of a replaced mitral valve is only ten to fifteen years, there is no dispute that Oden eventually would have had to endure another surgery to replace that mitral valve, no matter what happened during the January 2004 surgery.', '- 21 -', 'Doctor Schwartz also contends that, “[e]ven if the [first] surgery * * * had gone perfectly, Mr. Oden would still have suffered pain and suffering in his recovery from that surgery.” Thus, he asserts that the jury wrongly compensated Oden for his recovery from the January 2004 surgery. Moreover, Dr. Schwartz relies on Oden’s medical records, which indicate that, after the first surgery, Oden “[d]enie[d] chest pain, shortness of breath * * *. There have been no palpitations, lightheadedness, [or] dizziness * * *.” Further, Dr. Schwartz points out that nothing in the medical records provided by his cardiologist indicates that Oden had expressed “any concern about the [im]pending surgery” after learning of the A.I. resulting from the initial surgery. Moreover, Dr. Schwartz underscores the fact that Oden’s medical records after his August 2004 surgery note that Oden “is feeling great,” “feeling strong and back to his normal health,” and that he feels “almost too good.” These facts, he contends, belie Oden’s claim for any pain or suffering damages.', 'Lastly, Dr. Schwartz avers that the jury’s verdict was “based on sympathy and improperly reflects [Oden’s] condition resulting from his stroke.” Although Oden never claimed that the stroke was related to either surgery, Dr. Schwartz asserts that the jury’s verdict was wrought by misplaced sympathy. Oden appeared “frail and weak” on the witness stand, had difficulty speaking, and also had difficulty remembering events. Doctor Schwartz thus contends that the jury was overcome with sympathy for Oden, and, as a result, felt compelled to award him damages for his stroke, “which was not causally related to the alleged negligence in this case.”', '“A trial justice may disregard an award of damages and grant a new trial * * * ‘only if [that] award shocks the conscience or indicates that the jury was influenced by passion or prejudice or if the award demonstrates that the jury proceeded from a clearly erroneous basis in', '- 22 - assessing the fair amount of compensation to which a party is entitled.’” Murray v. Bromley, 945 A.2d 330, 333-34 (R.I. 2008) (quoting English v. Green, 787 A.2d 1146, 1150 (R.I. 2001)). Our review of a trial justice’s decision to uphold the jury’s damage award is the same as our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial—that is, unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong, we will leave the decision undisturbed. See Bonn v. Pepin, 11 A.3d 76, 78 (R.I. 2011) and Lennon v. Dacomed Corp., 901 A.2d 582, 590 (R.I 2006) (examining whether a trial justice “overlook[ed] or misconceive[d] relevant evidence” in his decision to grant a remittitur).', 'We find Dr. Schwartz’s criticism of the trial justice’s failure to order a remittitur or a new trial to be meritless. In her decision denying these motions, the trial justice aptly performed her role in assessing the credibility of witnesses, weighing the evidence, and evaluating the propriety of the damage award. After first determining that the evidence was sufficient to establish Dr. Schwartz’s negligence, she concluded that the damages award was satisfactory and that the “verdict does not shock the conscience.”', 'She credited Dr. Pett’s testimony, in which he stated that Oden now faces a higher risk of complications and death in his third surgery because both of his valves will need to be replaced, rather than just one. As a result of Dr. Schwartz’s negligence, Oden now has two artificial valves.', 'The uncontroverted testimony from Dr. Pearlman further indicated that having an artificial valve means “more artificial parts inside the body which tend to form blood clots, so there’s an increase for stroke[,] [as well as an] increase[ ] [in] the risk of infection in the heart.” We cannot disagree with the trial justice’s determination that “Oden lost an important body part as a result of the * * * negligence,” that he “faces additional high risk surgery,” and that “[h]is life expectancy has been reduced.”', '- 23 -', 'We acknowledge that there was conflicting evidence as to Oden’s pain and suffering— the medical records indicated that he “felt well,” whereas Oden testified on direct examination regarding his pain, suffering, and mental anguish. While defense counsel capably confronted Oden with this seemingly incongruous evidence, the jury was ultimately charged with weighing it.', 'Furthermore, we cannot disagree with the trial justice’s finding that Oden’s stroke did not prejudice the jury. At the outset, we note that Oden never claimed that the stroke was in any way related to the valve replacement surgeries, nor did counsel advocate any such argument to the jury. As the trial justice indicated, “[t]here was evidence that he had recovered well from his surgeries.”', 'As such, “[t]here is no reason to think that the jury did not consider this countervailing evidence.” Additionally, the fact that the jury rejected Linda Oden’s loss of consortium claim further demonstrates that it was not unduly affected by sympathy for plaintiffs. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice correctly denied Dr. Schwartz’s motion to vacate, alter, or amend the damage award.', 'D', 'Insurance Instruction', 'Doctor Schwartz next assails the trial justice’s sua sponte instruction to the jury regarding insurance. 16 He asserts that this instruction was an error of law in direct contravention of Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. We repeat that, when this Court is called upon to review “issues pertaining to jury instructions, we do so de novo.” Vargas, 991 A.2d at 1060. In so doing, “we examine the challenged portion in the context in which it was delivered to ascertain how a jury composed of ordinary, intelligent lay people would have understood the 16', 'For the trial justice’s full insurance instruction, see part I-B, supra.', '- 24 - instructions.” State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 488 (R.I. 2002). In conducting this review, we first turn to the text and scope of Rule 411.', 'In pertinent part, Rule 411 states: “[e]vidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether he acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.” However, such evidence may be allowed “when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, bias or prejudice of a witness, or when the court determines that in the interests of justice evidence of insurance or lack of insurance should be permitted.” Id.', ""Although a trial justice’s instructions are not “evidence,” we review her instruction on insurance under Rule 411 to determine whether it violated the spirit of the rule. It is well settled that the purpose of Rule 411 is “to discourage inquiry into a defendant's indemnity in a manner calculated to influence the jury. It is applicable only where, in all the circumstances, it cannot be reasonably concluded that the jury could ignore or disregard such references to an insurer.” Cochran v. Dube, 114 R.I. 149, 152, 330 A.2d 76, 78 (1975)."", 'Here, the reference to insurance did not come about—as often happens—from counsel or from any of the testifying witnesses. Rather, in this case, the reference to insurance came directly from the trial justice during her closing instructions to the jury.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice’s insurance instruction was proper. Although neither party introduced evidence regarding insurance, the trial justice, who had a front-row seat to the trial proceedings, was not oblivious to the fact that the overall concept of liability insurance may have pervaded the minds of the jurors in this case. While Dr. Schwartz characterizes the trial justice’s determination that the jurors were aware of insurance coverage as “speculative,” we would be hard-pressed to agree.', 'The concept of liability insurance is a wholly familiar', '- 25 - concept—from mandatory motor vehicle insurance coverage to the vigorous nationwide debate concerning medical insurance and medical liability, it can hardly be said that jurors are not thinking about liability coverage in one sense or another. Indeed, the Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 411 declares that “[t]he Rhode Island approach tempers the rule excluding evidence of liability insurance with a realistic view of contemporary society that recognizes the ubiquitous presence of insurance.”', ""Here, the trial justice’s instruction simply addressed the reality that jurors often wonder about liability coverage, especially in instances where there is typically an insured risk, such as medical malpractice. The trial justice’s instruction did nothing more than prohibit the jury from speculating about insurance coverage in its deliberations on the merits of the case—a prohibition that directly squares with the spirit of Rule 411. While the trial justice might more appropriately have refrained from using the phrase “a physician’s insurance premiums” in her instruction, we cannot say that the use of this phrase so pervaded the minds of the jurors that they were rendered incapable of arriving at a fair and impartial verdict. Indeed, the instruction expressly told the jurors to completely ignore any assumptions or implications concerning insurance coverage— and it is well settled that “the members of the jury are presumed to follow the trial justice's instructions.” See State v. Clark, 754 A.2d 73, 80 (R.I. 2000) (quoting State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996))."", 'Moreover, as the trial justice pointed out, this instruction comprised about thirty seconds of the approximately two-hour-long instruction given to the jury.

42,(08-75-2) (08-75-3) In re Rita F.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This is an appeal from a Family Court decree that terminated the parental rights of Rita F. 1 (respondent) to her three children—Rita (born June 22, 2000), Theresa (born January 31, 2002), and Michael (October 29, 2004)—under G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii) (cruel or abusive conduct), § 15-7-7(a)(2)(v) (aggravated circumstances), and § 15-7-7(a)(3) (child in Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF or department) custody for twelve months). 2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the trial justice committed 1', 'The father of the children died unexpectedly about one-and-one-half years before the events at issue took place. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7, entitled “Termination of parental rights,” provides, in pertinent part:', '“(a) The court shall, upon a petition duly filed by a governmental', 'child placement agency or licensed child placement agency after', 'notice to the parent and a hearing on the petition, terminate any', 'and all legal rights of the parent to the child, including the right to', 'notice of any subsequent adoption proceedings involving the child,', '-1- reversible error because he permitted witnesses to testify about hearsay statements made by the children. The respondent also argues that the trial justice erred when he failed to address whether DCYF had met its burden of proving that it made reasonable efforts to achieve reunification between the respondent and her children before DCYF filed a petition to terminate parental rights. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background', 'On July 22, 2008, DCYF received a phone call to its Child Abuse Hotline; it was reported that respondent’s boyfriend, Ramiro Morales, had been charged with the first-degree child', 'if the court finds as a fact by clear and convincing evidence that:', '“* * *', '“(2) The parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions', 'seriously detrimental to the child; such as, but not limited to, the', 'following:', '“* * *', '“(ii) Conduct toward any child of a cruel or abusive nature;', '“* * *', '“(v) The parent has subjected the child to aggravated', 'circumstances, which circumstances shall be abandonment, torture,', 'chronic abuse and sexual abuse;', '“* * *', '“(3) The child has been placed in the legal custody or care of', 'the department for children, youth, and families for at least twelve', '(12) months, and the parents were offered or received services to', 'correct the situation which led to the child being placed; provided,', 'that there is not a substantial probability that the child will be able', 'to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of', 'time considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent', 'home; or', '“(4) The parent has abandoned or deserted the child.”', '-2- molestation of his brother’s daughter when she was between the ages of four and nine. 3 At the time that DCYF received that disturbing information, Morales lived with respondent and her three children, Rita, Theresa, and Michael, who were approximately ages eight, six, and four, respectively. Concerned that respondent’s children might also become victims, Jennifer Silva, a child protective investigator for DCYF, who later testified at respondent’s trial for termination of parental rights, was assigned to investigate the family. Silva explained that on the same day that the Child Abuse Hotline received the phone call about Morales, she visited respondent’s household. During that visit, respondent told Silva that she was aware of the allegations against Morales, but that she did not believe them and, in fact, she had posted his bail after he was arrested on the charge of first-degree child molestation of his niece. After Silva informed her that either Morales needed to leave the home or the children would be removed, she “hesitatingly agreed” that Morales would leave. Silva also explained to respondent that Morales was to have no contact with the children during the pending investigation.', 'The next day, respondent called DCYF to request permission that her children be allowed to visit with Morales. For approximately six days, supervised visits were allowed. However, as soon as the case against Morales’ niece was “indicate[d]”—i.e., that child protective investigators concluded that, by a preponderance of the evidence, Morales’ niece had been “abused or neglected,” see In re Brooklyn M., 933 A.2d 1113, 1115 n.1 (R.I. 2007)—Silva informed respondent that Morales was no longer permitted to be alone with the children.', 'On August 8, 2008, Melissa D’Abrosca, a social caseworker for DCYF, who also testified at the subsequent trial, was assigned to the case. D’Abrosca first contacted respondent 3', 'According to respondent’s brief, on February 2, 2012, Morales plead guilty to four counts of first-degree child molestation of his niece and was sentenced to fifty-five years with thirty years to serve.', '-3- by phone on August 12, 2008, and she reiterated that Morales could not be in the home with the children and that she would be making both announced and unannounced visits to the home. During this conversation, respondent assured the caseworker that the children did not have any contact with Morales.', 'Between August 2008 and February 2010, D’Abrosca made at least one monthly unannounced visit to the household to determine whether Morales was on the premises and to check on the welfare of the children. During her first visit to the home, which occurred on August 18, 2008, she discovered that blankets were covering all the windows and a surveillance camera was employed to monitor the front door. The respondent explained to D’Abrosca that the blankets and camera were in place because she had obtained a restraining order against her sister. It was also during this visit that Michael made a reference to “daddy”—specifically, Michael asked, “Where did daddy go?” This was of concern to D’Abrosca, because Rita had relayed to her that Michael considered Morales to be his father, in view of the fact that his biological father had died shortly after Michael’s birth.', 'D’Abrosca testified that she again stressed to respondent that Morales was not allowed to be in the home and that if he were there, it would jeopardize the children’s placement with her.', 'When D’Abrosca visited on September 18, 2008, nobody answered the door, even though she could hear loud music emanating from the house and she saw the family van parked in the driveway. 4 D’Abrosca then went to visit Rita and Theresa at their school—something that she did on a monthly basis. She testified that she would talk to the children individually about inappropriate touching and explained that it was her job to keep them safe. However, even 4', 'D’Abrosca left a note during this particular visit, which respondent responded to by telephone. D’Abrosca testified that she continued to make monthly unannounced visits, but that often no one would answer the door, even when the family van was parked in the driveway.', '-4- though D’Abrosca noted that Rita “appeared very nervous” when the topic of inappropriate touching was broached, the girls never disclosed any sexual abuse to her.', 'D’Abrosca was troubled by the fact that respondent was not allowing DCYF access to the home, and she was concerned that Morales was in the home. She filed a motion for a court order to restrain and enjoin respondent from allowing Morales to have any contact with the children or to allow him into the home and also to allow the department access to the home. The Family Court granted DCYF’s petition and entered a no-contact order against Morales. The court also committed the children to the care, custody, and control of DCYF; however, the children remained placed in their home until they were removed by the department on February 11, 2009.', 'The events leading to the children’s removal from the home occurred on February 10, 2009, the second time D’Abrosca gained access to the home during an unannounced visit. During this visit, Michael made a remark about how “daddy” had given him a snack, but when he was asked where “daddy” was, Michael said he did not know. D’Abrosca reiterated to respondent that Morales was not allowed in the home, and she responded that she would not jeopardize the placement of the children with her. Her visit that day caused D’Abrosca to have concerns that Morales had been in the home, so she returned the next day with her supervisor. After waiting fifteen minutes for respondent to answer the door, the two gained entry and asked respondent to let them look around the house. They discovered a bed pushed up against a closet. When asked what was in the closet, respondent became very nervous and said she was going to call her attorney. D’Abrosca then contacted the North Smithfield Police Department to conduct a search of the house; the search disclosed the presence of Morales—who was found hiding underneath the bed—a full wardrobe of his clothing, and his medications and other items.', '-5- Morales and respondent were immediately arrested for obstruction, 5 and a hold was placed on Michael, who was present.', 'Rita and Theresa were picked up at their school by DCYF personnel. 6', 'The children were then transported to Hasbro Children’s Hospital for medical examination. The children were examined by Dr. Amy Goldberg, who later testified at trial as an expert in pediatric child abuse. When she examined Rita, Dr. Goldberg discovered that Rita’s “genital examination was grossly abnormal.” There was deep scarring, which was indicative of vaginal penetration. She described the scarring as “some of the deepest” she had ever seen. She also testified that the trauma that caused this type of scarring would have resulted in a “significant” and “obvious amount of blood” that would have required pressure and the holding of gauze in the area. When tested for sexually transmitted infections, the results showed that Rita had “bacterial vaginosis,” which was “highly uncommon” in children who were Rita’s age, and a yeast infection. Based on the scarring and untreated sexually transmitted infections, Dr. Goldberg concluded that Rita had been sexually abused, had suffered from significant and severe 5', 'The respondent’s appellate counsel represented to this Court in her brief that Morales pleaded nolo contendere to the obstruction charge on April 7, 2009; the charge against respondent was dismissed. D’Abrosca proceeded to file a petition for termination of parental rights against respondent, alleging cruel and abusive treatment; this petition was eventually withdrawn, although a subsequent petition was filed on September 24, 2010, which forms the basis of this appeal. 6', 'The children were placed in a foster home, but on February 19, 2008—after about one week— DCYF filed a motion for change of placement and the children were removed and placed in two separate foster homes—Rita and Theresa with one family and Michael with another.', 'In her brief, the respondent’s appellate counsel also represented to this Court that during this time, respondent visited her children, until March 17, 2010, when a no-contact order was entered because a felony complaint was filed against her for three counts of criminal neglect of her children under G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5. She filed a motion to vacate the no-contact order, but it was denied. On June 11, 2012, respondent pleaded nolo contendere to all three counts under North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). Under the holding in Alford, 400 U.S. at 38, a court may accept a defendant’s plea of guilty or nolo contendere if the court is satisfied that there is enough factual evidence to support a verdict of guilty, despite a defendant’s professed belief in his or her innocence.', '-6- vaginal penetration, and had been neglected, in that no one had sought medical care for her. Significantly, however, during the visit to the hospital, neither Rita, Theresa, nor Michael made any disclosures of sexual abuse to the medical personnel who examined or treated them.', 'From April 2009 until February 2010, Laura Ryan, who was qualified at trial as an expert in the area of sexual abuse of children, provided therapy to the children as well as sexual-abuse evaluations.', 'It was not until May 21, 2009—during Rita’s fourth therapy session and approximately three-and-one-half months following the removal of the children from their home—that Rita disclosed the repeated sexual molestation and penetration by Morales. Rita also revealed that she had relayed the abuse to her mother on “numerous occasions” and also that the abuse had stopped in about May 2008. Shortly after Rita’s disclosure, Theresa and Michael also told Ryan of various acts of sexual assault by Morales. Ryan notified the Child Abuse Hotline of the disclosures on May 26, 2009. She ultimately diagnosed the girls with post-traumatic stress disorder.', 'After Ryan contacted the Child Abuse Hotline about the sexual-abuse disclosures, Kelly Mainor, a child protective investigator for DCYF, increased her involvement in the case. Mainor had been assigned to the case from February 14, 2009 to January 6, 2010, but she had visited the children on only one occasion prior to the report of abuse from Ryan. Indeed, after her initial meeting, Mainor testified, her “next action was to kind of sit back and wait” to see if the children disclosed any sexual abuse. After she received notice of the disclosures to Ryan, Mainor went to interview Rita and Theresa. Each child disclosed various acts of sexual abuse that they had endured, and each revealed that respondent either was present while the abuse occurred or that', '-7- she had been told about the abuse. 7', 'Based on the children’s reports, Mainor indicated respondent for neglect and sexual abuse against her children. 8 On September 24, 2010, DCYF petitioned to terminate the parental rights of respondent under §§ 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii), 15-7- 7(a)(2)(v), 15-7-7(a)(3), and 15-7-7(a)(4). 9 A trial was held in the Family Court on various dates, beginning on May 13, 2011 and concluding on July 25, 2011.', 'B', 'Termination of Parental Rights Proceedings', 'At respondent’s trial for termination of parental rights, the state offered testimony of D’Abrosca, Dr. Goldberg, Silva, Mainor, Ryan, and Leanne Cuomo, a social worker for DCYF. D’Abrosca and Silva testified about the early investigation of the case, including the numerous warnings given to respondent that Morales was not to have contact with the children. Doctor Goldberg testified to her findings as a result of her examination of Rita, and Mainor and Ryan testified about the disclosures the children made to them during the therapy sessions. Finally, Cuomo testified that the children were currently placed with a paternal aunt and uncle in South Carolina since February 2011 and had adjusted well to that placement, which was a preadoptive home. The respondent was also called to the stand, but she invoked her privilege against self- incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution because of the 7', 'Mainor’s initial meeting with Rita and Theresa occurred on May 30, 2009. She met with all three children in December 2009 after more information was reported to the Child Abuse Hotline from another therapist, Wendy Pires, who was working with the children. Although Rita and Theresa disclosed further actions of abuse, Michael never made any disclosures to Mainor. 8', 'According to the respondant’s appellate counsel, Morales was indicted for ten counts of first- degree child molestation and six counts of second-degree child molestation as a result of the children’s statements. On February 2, 2012, he pleaded guilty to multiple counts of first-degree child molestation in this case as well as the case involving his niece, and he was sentenced to thirty years to serve with lifetime GPS monitoring. 9', 'Additionally, D’Abrosca testified that there were some efforts to make a case plan, but she added that once the termination petition was filed, there was no further case planning with respondent as there were no plans for reunification.', '-8- companion criminal case against her for neglect. The respondent objected to the admission of the testimony of Mainor and Ryan about the children’s statements, arguing that the statements were not admissible under the children hearsay exception of G.L.1956 § 14-1-69, because there was a lengthy passage of time between the alleged acts of abuse and the children’s disclosures. However, the trial justice overruled the objections and allowed the testimony.', 'On August 19, 2011, the trial justice issued a bench decision, granting DCYF’s petitions under §§ 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii) (cruel or abusive conduct), § 15-7-7(a)(2)(v) (aggravated circumstances), and § 15-7-7(a)(3) (child in DCYF custody for twelve months), while denying DCYF’s petitions under § 15-7-7(a)(4) (abandonment). The trial justice concluded that “[t]here [wa]s not the slightest doubt in the mind of this [c]ourt that these three children * * * were both physically and sexually abused by mother’s live-in boyfriend.” To support his conclusion, the trial justice recounted the graphic testimony of Dr. Goldberg and Ryan, and he also summarized the testimony of D’Abrosca, Silva, and Mainor regarding the multiple warnings to respondent that Morales could not be around the children. He also noted that he drew his own inference from respondent invoking her privilege not to testify under the Fifth Amendment.', 'With regard to the issue of whether or not respondent was either aware of the sexual abuse or, in the exercise of due diligence, should have become aware of the sexual abuse, the trial justice concluded that, “based upon the testimony, [and] the observations of the Court, mother was well aware of what was transpiring between Mr. Morales and the children and that mother made a deliberate choice between what she desired and what was, in fact, best for the children.” The trial justice explained that “[t]he record [wa]s replete with instances where the children revealed that they had informed the mother of their treatment at the hand of Mr. Morales,” and he referred to various statements made by the children to Mainor and Ryan.', '-9- Specifically, the trial justice reviewed the testimony of Ryan, who testified that Rita had told her that she told respondent numerous times about the sexual abuse. He also recited various hearsay statements, including that respondent had been present when Morales spanked the children, respondent was present during one incident when Morales was naked and holding Michael in his lap, respondent called the house before she came home to inform Morales of her imminent return, and, at one point, respondent asked the children to decide whether they wanted Morales to go or to stay.', 'Based on these findings, the trial justice found that respondent was unfit as a parent, having “violated all the principles of motherhood.” He also found that that it was “in the best interest of these children that [the] parental rights of biological mother be terminated” as she “deliberately and with due thought chose her own needs, wants, and desires over the safety and protection of her three children,” and that the children were in a preadoptive home with a paternal relatives and had bonded well in that environment. A final decree terminating the parental rights of respondent was entered on August 30, 2011. The respondent timely appealed to this Court, challenging the admission of the children’s hearsay statements as well as the trial justice’s failure to make any findings as to whether DCYF made reasonable efforts to reunite respondent with her children.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When this Court reviews the termination of parental rights, we examine the record “to establish whether the [trial] justice’s findings are supported by legal and competent evidence.” In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 83 (R.I. 2006)). “The findings of the Family Court justice are accorded ‘great weight’ on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that they ‘are clearly wrong or the trial justice', '- 10 - overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 881 (R.I. 2009) (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1174). Furthermore, a “natural parent’s right to due process requires that the state support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1174).', 'III', 'Analysis', '1', 'Hearsay Statements', 'During the trial, the trial justice allowed both Ryan and Mainor to testify about hearsay statements made to them by the children. The respondent argues that both the passage of time and the fact that the children had been questioned by and made statements to multiple individuals about their sexual abuse should have precluded the admission of the challenged testimony, because there was ample time for the children to reflect and deliberate, and, as a result, the children’s statements were not spontaneous. Conversely, DCYF maintains that the statements made by the children to their therapists were properly admitted under the child hearsay exception set forth in § 14-1-69, because of the indicia of reliability of the statements. These indicia, argues the state, include the level of trauma endured by the children, their young ages, and the corroborating medical evidence.', 'In a similar vein, the guardian ad litem for the children contends that the length of time before the children disclosed the sexual abuse was not unreasonable because, given the “months of being subjected to a bizarre atmosphere of abuse and concealment” created by Morales, the disclosures to Ryan were the first opportunity for the children to feel safe. 10 10', 'The department argues that we should look to the law of other jurisdictions that list various factors to consider in determining whether a child’s delay in disclosure of sexual abuse was', '- 11 -', 'Section 14-1-69 provides, in pertinent part:', '“Hearsay. — In any custody and/or termination trial * * *', 'where a petition has been filed by the department of children,', 'youth, and families in accordance with §§ 14-1-11, 40-11-7 and/or', '15-7-7 in the family court, the court may, in its discretion, permit', 'as evidence any statement by a child under the age of thirteen (13)', 'years old about a prescribed act of abuse, neglect, or misconduct', 'by a parent or guardian, if that statement was made spontaneously', 'within a reasonable time after the act is alleged to have occurred,', 'and if the statement was made to someone the child would', 'normally turn to for sympathy, protection, or advice.” Indeed, we have interpreted § 14-1-69 as “liberaliz[ing] the common law test for admission of children’s out-of-court statements concerning their physical abuse” by eliminating “the requirement that the declarant must have been ‘laboring under the stress of nervous excitement’ when the statement was made.” In re Deborah M., 544 A.2d 572, 574 (R.I. 1988) (quoting State v. Creighton, 462 A.2d 980, 982 (R.I. 1983)). Despite the relaxed standards of timeliness and spontaneity under § 14-1-69, there are, nevertheless, limits to the admissibility of hearsay statements made by children in custody and termination proceedings. We have held that the passing of a few days or weeks between either a child’s disclosure of abuse and the date that the alleged abuse occurred or the date when the child was removed from the scene of the abuse constitutes a reasonable time lapse for purposes of § 14-1-69. However, it is significant that the passing of several months between the acts of alleged abuse and a child’s disclosure consistently has been held to be unreasonable. Compare In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d 1366, 1367 (R.I. 1997) reasonable in the particular circumstances. Similarly, the guardian ad litem argues that we should adopt the reasoning and rationale used in the “fresh complaint” doctrine, as applied in other jurisdictions. See 75 C.J.S. Rape § 72 at 366-67 (2002) (“The fresh complaint doctrine permits an out-of-court complaint seasonably made by the complainant in a sexual assault case to be admitted as part of the prosecution’s case-in-chief, for the purposes of corroborating the complainant’s testimony and not for substantive purposes.”). However, we see no need to refer to the law of other jurisdictions for guidance in deciding the issues in this case; our own jurisprudence furnishes ample assistance.', '- 12 - (statements made after two weeks admissible), and In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 205 (R.I. 1989) (statements made to a social worker during the first few weeks after the child victim had been placed in foster care were admissible under § 14-1-69), with In re Rocco W., 706 A.2d 1302, 1304 (R.I. 1998) (hearsay statements made approximately six months after the child was removed from the abuse were not within a reasonable time after the alleged abuse occurred), and In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d 1357, 1360, 1361 (R.I. 1997) (statements made “almost three months after” children removed from scene of alleged abuse not admissible under § 14-1-69).', 'It is further noteworthy that we have rejected “any approach to this issue that calls for blind obedience to the clock and an hour-by-hour count of the time that has passed between the event and the declaration”; rather, “the test to be applied is whether from the facts of a particular case the statements were spontaneous or impulsive or whether they were the product of reflection and deliberation.” In re Deborah M., 544 A.2d at 574-75, 575. In determining whether a statement was made with spontaneity or at the child’s first safe opportunity to disclose the alleged abuse, we have considered factors such as whether there were “significant lapses of time, ample opportunity for reflection and deliberation, and numerous previous disclosures of abuse * * *.” In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d at 1361.', 'In this case, the children disclosed the sexual abuse approximately ten months after the alleged abuse had ceased and approximately three months after they had been removed from the scene of the abuse. Although we have declined to delineate any precise time limits for such statements to be admissible, we have never extended the hearsay exception under § 14-1-69 to more than “a few weeks.” In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d at 201, 205. However, our review of the record in this case makes it clear, without question, that the children’s hearsay statements were not necessary for the trial justice to determine that abuse had occurred or that a termination of', '- 13 - parental rights was appropriate. Thus, even if the admission of the children’s statements was erroneous, it does not demand reversal of the trial justice’s finding that respondent knew the children were being sexually abused by Morales. 11 Contrary to respondent’s argument that the only evidence of her knowledge of the abuse was the statements by the children to Ryan and Mainor, it is our opinion that there is a plethora of independent, competent evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s decision.', 'First, when respondent had these children in her care, she permitted them to live with an individual who she knew had been charged with first-degree child molestation of a child within the same age range as her own children. It is beyond question that sexual abuse is conduct that endangers a child’s physical or emotional well-being. Further, parental knowledge that an actual offense has occurred is not necessary; it is sufficient that the parent was aware of the potential for danger and disregarded the risk. See In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772, 778 (R.I. 2000) (a parent who ignores or stands by while child abuse or neglect occurs is tantamount to the parent inflicting the abuse himself or herself for purposes of a termination proceeding); In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d 612, 618 (R.I. 1997) (holding that parents are held to a greater level of responsibility and awareness concerning the well-being of their children than other adults, and parents who ignore abuse are as culpable as the actors in the context of termination of parental rights); see, e.g., In re Jennifer R., 667 A.2d 535, 536 (R.I. 1995) (affirming a termination of parental rights when the trial justice found that the mother “[wa]s totally aligned with her husband [the abuser] 11', 'The department also argues that the statements are admissible under the hearsay exception for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. However, because we conclude that there was clear and convincing legally competent evidence in the record to support the termination of parental rights without the children’s statements, we decline to comment on this issue.', '- 14 - * * * [and] therefore, [was] unable to be supportive to her daughters [and] * * * unable to protect them”).', 'The undisputed evidence in this record supports a determination that, despite numerous reminders and warnings from DCYF that Morales had been accused of sexually molesting his niece and that respondent needed to remove him from her home, respondent did not end the relationship. Instead, she bailed him out of jail when he was incarcerated after being accused of molesting his niece—claiming that she believed that he was falsely accused—and she moved him into her home, despite the continued warnings from DCYF and in clear violation of a court order that the children were to have no contact with him. Not only did she disregard DCYF’s warnings and defy a court order, she also provided mendacious statements to DCYF about her contact with Morales: Silva and D’Abrosca testified that they had instructed her on multiple occasions that Morales was not to be in contact with the children, and each time, respondent falsely responded that he was not. Also, when asked about the surveillance camera and blankets over the windows, she responded untruthfully, telling the social worker that she had obtained a restraining order against her sister, although it was later revealed that it was Morales who had shrouded the windows with blankets and installed the security camera to avoid detection by DCYF. Indeed, the testimony by Silva and D’Abrosca support the unavoidable conclusion that respondent failed to provide proper care or protection for her children when she allowed Morales, an accused sex offender, to move into her home and when she refused to end the relationship with him, thereby subjecting her children to an unreasonable risk of physical and emotional harm. See § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii), (v).', '- 15 -', 'In addition, the graphic medical evidence presented by Dr. Goldberg reveals that Rita suffered from obvious and serious injuries that could not have escaped the watchful eye of a loving parent. Indeed, we have held that when a child suffers obvious injuries,', '“[i]t [is] reasonable for [a] trial justice to conclude on the basis of', 'the evidence before him that a loving, caring parent would have', 'known the source of the injuries and would have reported this', 'information to physicians or to the police if she had not caused', 'them herself or permitted them to happen.” In re Frances, 505', 'A.2d 1380, 1385 (R.I. 1986). In this case, Dr. Goldberg testified that Rita’s injuries would have resulted in a copious amount of blood and significant pain. She explained that Rita had incurred “some of the deepest scarring that [she had] seen,” and that this trauma would have resulted in “a significant amount of blood.” In fact, Dr. Goldberg explained that Rita’s injuries would have resulted in so much bleeding that they would have required pressure and the holding of gauze in the “injured area” to stanch the flow of blood. Further, even though Dr. Goldberg did not testify about her examination of Theresa or Michael, DCYF’s petition to terminate respondent’s parental rights as to Theresa and Michael was amply supported by clear and convincing evidence because they were also exposed to the risk of cruel and abusive conduct and the aggravated circumstance of sexual abuse. See In re Frances, 505 A.2d at 1385 (terminating parental rights with respect to all children based on cruel and abusive conduct to only one child, reasoning that “[t]he state * * * need not wait until a child’s life has been permanently or irretrievably impaired before acting” quoting In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 881 (R.I. 1980)).', 'Further, during the trial on termination of parental rights, respondent invoked her privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. We specifically have stated that in the trial of a petition seeking the termination of parental rights, the invocation of the protection afforded under the Fifth Amendment in order to avoid testifying does not forbid the drawing of', '- 16 - adverse inferences against a party who refuses to testify. In re Rosalie H., 899 A.2d 199, 206 (R.I. 2006). Here, respondent invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege after every question, including whether she knew Morales was facing criminal charges for first-degree child molestation, whether she had bailed Morales out of jail, whether she allowed Morales to be around the children after being told by DCYF that he could not be near them, whether she faced criminal charges, whether she visited Morales at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) and told him that she wanted him to come back and live with the children, and whether her children told her that Morales was sexually assaulting them. In light of all the other evidence adduced at trial, it was proper for the trial justice to draw an adverse inference when respondent refused to answer any questions whatsoever.', 'Moreover, the finding of cruel or abusive conduct and aggravated circumstances on the part of respondent shifted the burden of producing evidence of parental fitness to respondent to “present evidence demonstrating ‘that his or her past abusive conduct no longer endangers the safety of a child.’” In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1175 (quoting In re Corryn B., 914 A.2d 978, 983 n.3 (R.I. 2007)). There was no such evidence presented here.', 'Accordingly, after reviewing the record, we are of the opinion that, even without the children’s hearsay statements, clear and convincing evidence exists to support the trial justice’s findings that respondent was unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to her children, in that she allowed conduct to be committed towards her children of a cruel and abusive nature, and she subjected her children to aggravated circumstances of sexual abuse. See § 15-7- 7(a)(2)(ii), (v). 12 12', 'In view of our holding that the trial justice articulated a proper basis for termination of respondent’s parental rights in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii) and (v), we need not and', '- 17 -', '2', 'Reunification Efforts', 'Because we agree with the trial justice that respondent’s rights were properly terminated pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii) and (v), DCYF was under no obligation to attempt reunification of the family.

See In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198, 203 n.10 (R.I. 2008) (“It should be noted that [the statutory requirement that reasonable efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship be made prior to filing a termination of parental rights petition] does not apply to abuse petitions filed under § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii).”).', '3', 'Best Interests of the Children', 'Once a Family Court justice establishes that the state has proven a statutory justification for terminating the relationship between a biological parent and child, here § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii) and (v), he still must establish that “the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” In re Dayvon G., 10 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Brook Ann R., 994 A.2d 1241, 1244 (R.I. 2010)). We are “ever cognizant of the significance of severing the bond between parent and child,” but also resolutely appreciate that “it is in the best interests of children to have a safe and nurturing environment in which to live, learn and grow.” In re Daniel D., 9 A.3d 651, 657 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d 159, 170 (R.I. 2009)).', 'In this case, the trial justice found that it was in the best interests of the three children to terminate the respondent’s parental rights because all three children were living together with a therefore shall not address respondent’s other claim of error under § 15-7-7(a)(3).

After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s “best interests” determination. Indeed, the fact that the respondent was willing to jeopardize the children’s safety and welfare for the sake of maintaining a relationship with Morales is evidence that she is unlikely to be able to provide the proper care and custody for her children.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the respondent-mother’s appeal is denied.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'It is undisputed that plaintiffs own real estate located at 24–26 Farragut Avenue in Providence (the property) and that they have owned the property jointly since 2000.1 The parties agree that the subject dwelling units at 24–26 Farragut Avenue were constructed in approximately 1911—several years prior to 1923, the year in which Providence adopted its first zoning ordinance. Pursuant to the terms of the 1923 zoning ordinance, any uses established prior to the enactment of that ordinance were deemed to be grandfathered unless abandoned. Neither party disputes the fact that the property owned by plaintiffs is currently situated in a Residential R-2 zone, which zone is defined by the current zoning ordinance as being one ―intended for low density residential areas comprising single-family dwelling units and two-family dwelling units in detached structures located on lots with a minimum land area of five thousand (5,000) square feet.‖ See Providence Code of Ordinances, Part II, ch. 27, art. I, sec. 101.', 'In 2008, plaintiffs sought permits from the city so that they might restore electrical meters at the Farragut Avenue property. Before issuing the requested permits, the city conducted an inspection of the property, during which plaintiffs were found to be in violation of several provisions of the city’s housing code and Rhode Island’s building code. Most pertinently, the inspection revealed that the property was being used as a three-family dwelling and that, therefore, it was not in compliance with the above-quoted provision of the zoning ordinance. The city maintains that the area in which the property is located is zoned for single- and two- 1', 'In fact, Cecilia Cigarrilha has been an owner of the property since 1985, having at that time acquired joint ownership with her former husband as tenants by the entirety.', '-2- family residences, and it contests plaintiffs’ contention that they should benefit from the grandfathering provision.', 'On May 1, 2008, plaintiffs commenced this action in the Superior Court for Providence County by filing a verified complaint as well as a motion for a temporary restraining order. In that motion, plaintiffs sought to enjoin the city from enforcing the city’s codes based upon the above-referenced violations; in addition, they sought to compel the city’s building official to issue all permits necessary with respect to restoring the electrical meters. After a hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion justice of the Superior Court ordered that the city issue building permits that would allow plaintiffs to restore electricity to the property (with a proviso that the basement of the property was not to be used ―for habitable occupancy‖). The motion justice also made it clear that her order was temporary and that its purpose was ―to restore the property to the status quo‖ until an administrative hearing could be held before the city’s zoning board on the issue of what plaintiffs contended was the legal nonconforming use of the property.', 'Following the May 1, 2008 hearing in the Superior Court, plaintiffs filed with the city’s zoning board an appeal of the city official’s determination that their property was an illegal three-family dwelling. After a hearing on July 22, the zoning board affirmed the city official’s determination that using the property as a three-family dwelling was illegal.', 'Thereafter, plaintiffs filed an amended verified complaint in their pending Superior Court action, in which they appealed the zoning board’s decision and sought a declaration that their use of the property as a three-family dwelling was a legal nonconforming use. In due course, a nonjury trial took place, during which the parties submitted an agreed statement of facts and a number of exhibits. The exhibits included, inter alia, a fire inspection record from 1940, which', '-3- record indicated that the property was then being occupied in a two-family manner, and certain tax assessment records from the 1940s, which records indicated that the property had been taxed as a three-family dwelling. The parties agree that that manner of taxing the property has continued since that time.', 'Thereafter, the trial justice issued a written decision, in which he found that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proving that the property was used as a three-family dwelling prior to the enactment of the city’s first zoning ordinance in 1923. He therefore declined to declare that the property constituted a legal nonconforming use. The trial justice also ruled that plaintiffs had failed to establish that either equitable estoppel or the equitable doctrine of laches precluded the city from enforcing its zoning ordinance.', 'The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal. They assert three arguments on appeal: (1) that the trial justice erred in concluding that the property was not a nonconforming use; (2) that the trial justice erred in concluding that tax assessments had no bearing on the issue of nonconforming use and did not provide a basis for holding the city to be equitably estopped; and (3) that the trial justice erred in declining to allow plaintiffs to rely upon the doctrine of laches as a basis for ruling that the city should not be permitted to enforce the provision of the zoning ordinance that prohibits using the property in a three-family manner.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In an action for declaratory relief, a justice of the Superior Court has ―discretion to grant or deny declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act * * *.‖ Town of Barrington v.

Town of Exeter, 787 A.2d 1136, 1144 (R.I. 2001). It is axiomatic that the ―burden of proving a nonconforming use is upon the person or corporation asserting the nonconforming use‖; it is also a basic principle that that ―burden cannot be sustained by hearsay or unsworn testimony or when the evidence of such alleged prior use is contradictory.‖ See id.

In order to succeed in having their property declared a legal nonconforming use, plaintiffs were required to prove that the Farragut Avenue property was used as a three-family dwelling at the time of the enactment of the zoning ordinance in 1923. See RICO Corp., 787 A.2d at 1144. We note that all evidence in the record, including the tax assessment records, postdate 1923. Bearing in mind the previously described burden of proof that the law imposes upon plaintiffs, it is our view that we need not address plaintiffs’ above-referenced contention because the evidence of any use of the property after 1923 is irrelevant to the determination of legal nonconforming use. As the trial justice correctly noted, the record is silent as to the use of the property in 1923; accordingly, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof. Therefore, in our view, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in declining to declare that plaintiffs’ property was a legal nonconforming use, nor did he misinterpret the applicable law, overlook facts, or otherwise exceed his authority. See Town of Richmond, 941 A.2d at 155.', 'B', 'The Equitable Estoppel Contention', 'In an effort to win judicial approval of the use of their property as a three-family home, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice, by not properly considering certain tax assessment records', '-6- concerning the property, erred in not allowing the doctrine of equitable estoppel to preclude the city from enforcing its codes.

We agree with the trial justice that there is no evidence in the record that the city acted or made any representation which induced plaintiffs to act. Although plaintiffs pointed to tax assessments from the 1940s, they did not supply the trial justice with any conduct on behalf of the city that would lead to reliance that injured them. Moreover, simple reliance on taxes assessed (which taxes the parties agree are assessed based upon actual use) does not result in the equities being balanced in plaintiffs’ favor.', 'The plaintiffs benefited from additional rental income, thus negating the injury requirement of equitable estoppel.2 See Providence Teachers Union, 689 2', 'We note that, having determined that there is no evidence in the record that the city committed any act which induced plaintiffs to act to their detriment, we need not and therefore do not reach the issue of whether or not the doctrine of equitable estoppel would be appropriate in this case.', '-7- A.2d at 391–92.

Town of Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 702 (R.I. 1993). In order to pass upon the applicability (vel non) of the doctrine of laches in a particular case, the court looks to two considerations: (1) whether there has been negligence that has led to ―a delay in the prosecution of the case‖; and (2) whether that delay has prejudiced the adverse party. See School Committee of Cranston v. Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d 629, 644 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).

This case came before the Supreme Court on April 9, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. In this negligence case arising from a slip and fall on an icy surface, the plaintiff, Diane Berard, appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, HCP, Inc. (defendant or HCP). The plaintiff assigns error to two aspects of the trial justice‟s decision: (1) the finding that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, and (2) the denial of the plaintiff‟s request for a continuance. After hearing the arguments of counsel and carefully examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown. Therefore, we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 29, 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging negligence by defendant in failing properly to maintain its property located at 2191 Post Road in Warwick, Rhode Island. The plaintiff alleged that the property was “owned, operated, maintained, and/or controlled by [d]efendant[].” The plaintiff claimed that, on December 22, 2007, as a result of defendant‟s', '-1- negligence, she was injured and suffered lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and medical expenses.', 'In response, HCP filed an answer denying plaintiff‟s allegation of negligence and asserting contributory negligence and assumption of the risk as affirmative defenses. Thereafter, on December 9, 2011, HCP filed a motion for summary judgment. In support of summary judgment, HCP averred that “[a]t all relevant times, HCP was an out-of-state and out-of- possession landlord, having no contact with or control over the premises” where plaintiff‟s alleged injury occurred, and further averred that the property was leased to plaintiff‟s employer, Healthtrax.', 'HCP argued that, “[p]ursuant to the terms of its lease with Healthtrax, all maintenance of the premises was the responsibility of the tenant.” The defendant argued that, as a commercial landlord, it did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff because none of the circumstances under which a commercial establishment has a duty to an invitee of its tenant are present in this case. Specifically, HCP argued that its lease with Healthtrax did not require it to repair and maintain the premises, that plaintiff‟s injury was not caused by a latent defect, and that HCP did not assume a duty to repair the premises. In advancing that argument, HCP relied on our opinion in Holley v.

The trial court granted, and this Court affirmed, summary judgment in favor of the defendant. Id. at 273, 276.', 'At the hearing on summary judgment in this case, plaintiff indicated that a memorandum in support of her objection to defendant‟s motion for summary judgment had been delivered to', '-2- HCP that morning.1 Notably, plaintiff asserted that she “was not asking for a continuance on the issue,” but rather that she “[felt] that * * * defendant‟s motion [was] a bit premature.” The plaintiff asked the court for an “opportunity to inquire as to whether or not the landlord at some point in time did repair the premises.” According to plaintiff, “[i]f it comes to the point where there has been no undertaking by the landlord to repair the premises, then at that point * * * defendant‟s motion would be ripe.” The defendant argued in response that the complaint in this case was filed in 2010 and the motion for summary judgment had been filed two months before the hearing. Further, defendant contended that any depositions necessary to plaintiff‟s case should have been conducted before the hearing date.', 'At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice stated that plaintiff “had a duty before [that day] to address” any issues raised by defendant‟s summary judgment motion under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure or to present an affidavit or conduct discovery to show the existence of a material fact. Ultimately, the trial justice found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to any of the three exceptions articulated in Holley: “under the case law, a commercial [lessor] is not liable, or does not have a duty of care to an invitee of a tenant, except under those three exceptions.”', 'Accordingly, the trial justice granted HCP‟s motion for summary judgment. Judgment entered on February 15, 2012, and plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Before this Court, plaintiff argues that, although “[p]reliminary discovery was conducted * * *, no depositions [had] been taken by any party” and “summary judgment should not have been granted * * * based solely on a waiver of premises liability in a contract.” The plaintiff further contends that HCP owed a duty of care to plaintiff and that plaintiff “should have been 1', 'We pause to note that the record does not reflect that plaintiff‟s memorandum was filed with the Superior Court.', '-3- allowed to obtain evidence to support this finding.”', 'HCP, on the other hand, argues that summary judgment was appropriate because plaintiff failed to show that HCP had a duty of care to plaintiff and, further, that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in denying plaintiff‟s request for a continuance to conduct further discovery.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Allstate Insurance Co. v.

The plaintiffs, Jose Bustamante (Jose) and his wife, Ana (Ana)1 (collectively, plaintiffs), appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Hector R. Oshiro, M.D. (Dr. Oshiro), Samuel Greenblatt, M.D. (Dr. Greenblatt), Peter E. Baziotis, M.D., Alexander P. Robertson, M.D. (Dr. Robertson), Scott M. Levine, M.D. (Dr. Levine), Primary Care Medical Associates, Inc., Anesthesia Care, Inc., University Orthopedics, Inc., and Rhode Island Medical Imaging, Inc. The plaintiffs contend that the trial justice erred in declaring that the statute of limitations had run on the plaintiffs‟ medical- malpractice claims and that the action therefore was time-barred. After careful consideration, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The plaintiffs‟ complaint refers to Ana as “Anna Bustamante.” However, during her deposition, Ana testified that her name is “Ana Gaviria” and that she never has used the name “Anna Bustamante.” Similarly, in her interrogatory answers, Ana gave the name “Ana Gaviria.” In light of this discrepancy, we shall refer to her as “Ana.” The plaintiffs‟ complaint alleges that Ana has suffered “the loss of services, companionship, society, and comfort of her husband, Jose,” as a result of defendants‟ malpractice; her claim is thus derivative.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Save for the penultimate issues of liability and damages, the facts of this case are undisputed. The record discloses that, in October 2003, Jose was experiencing neck pain for which he visited his primary care physician, Dr. Oshiro. Doctor Oshiro ordered a cervical spine X-ray and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, the results of which were interpreted by Dr. Levine in April and May 2004. The interpretation of these results by Dr. Levine did not reveal any mass or tumor in Jose‟s neck. Additionally, Dr. Oshiro referred Jose to Dr. Greenblatt, a neurosurgeon, and Dr. Robertson, an orthopedic surgeon. Doctor Greenblatt examined Jose and the X-ray and MRI examination results in June 2004, and he concluded that Jose‟s symptoms were not neurological in nature. After reviewing the MRI results in November 2004, Dr. Robertson advised Jose that his symptoms were the result of degenerative disc disease.', 'Unsatisfied with these assessments and in the face of continuing symptoms, Jose sought a second opinion from Ivan Castano, M.D. (Dr. Castano), in Miami, Florida. An additional MRI examination was ordered in late May 2005, which revealed a mass in Jose‟s neck. The report accompanying that examination indicated the following: “Common differential considerations include chordoma, other primary or metastatic bone tumor, rheumatoid arthritis or infection. Further characterization with CT of the cervical spine is suggested.” Doctor Castano concluded that this mass was a cervical tumor, and he discussed this diagnosis and the results of the latest MRI examination with Jose and Ana on June 2, 2005.', 'Six days later, on June 8, 2005, Jose was admitted to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida. A “consultation note,” dated that same day, stated that “the appearance [of the mass] is consistent with a primary bone tumor such as a plasmacytoma or chordoma[;] however, numerous other diagnostic possibilities exist.” On June 10, 2005, Jose underwent surgical', '-2- resection of the tumor. Analysis of the excised tumor on the same day revealed that it was plasmacytoma, a form of cancer. The plaintiffs allege that Jose did not learn of the diagnosis of cancer until “on or about June 21, 2005,” after he was discharged from intensive care.', 'On June 9, 2008, plaintiffs filed a complaint, alleging multiple counts of negligence and lack of informed consent against the several doctors, and their employers, who had treated Jose in Rhode Island before Dr. Castano discovered the tumor.', 'The gravamen of plaintiffs‟ allegations was that defendants failed to diagnose and treat Jose‟s cancer.', 'The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs‟ suit was time- barred by the three-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14.1. The basis of this claim was that plaintiffs became aware of the alleged acts of malpractice on June 2, 2005, when Dr. Castano informed Jose and Ana that a tumor had been discovered in Jose‟s neck. To support this contention, defendants pointed to Ana‟s deposition testimony, in which she agreed with defense counsel that she first believed that Dr. Oshiro, Dr. Greenblatt, and Dr. Robertson “had done something wrong” when Dr. Castano told plaintiffs about the existence of the tumor. The defendants also relied on the following exchange that occurred during Jose‟s deposition: when asked, “Then when you were told about the mass on June 2, 2005, you felt that that was the mass—that was the problem that should have been diagnosed by Dr. Greenblatt, Dr. Robertson, and Dr. Oshiro, correct?,” Jose responded, “100 percent.” The defendants argued that this testimony, like Ana‟s testimony, established that Jose believed, as of June 2, 2005, that defendants had done something wrong. Similarly, defendants highlighted Jose‟s response to one of defendants‟ interrogatories, which asked for “the date on which you or anyone on your behalf first became aware of the fact that you had been harmed as a result of the defendant‟s conduct * * *.” Jose‟s answer read, “I found out I had a tumor at the base of my spine I believe in May', '-3- or June of 2005 through Dr. Ivan Castano that my previous medical providers failed to diagnose.”2 The defendants noted that Ana gave a similar answer to that interrogatory request. The defendants argued that this evidence demonstrated that, as of June 2, 2005, plaintiffs were aware of facts that would place a reasonable person on notice that a potential claim exists.', 'In opposition, plaintiffs argued that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until, at the earliest, June 10, 2005, when the tumor was discovered to be cancerous following Jose‟s surgery. The plaintiffs emphasized that the report from the second MRI examination indicated that follow-up tests were required to determine whether the tumor was cancerous or the result of noncancerous conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or infection.', 'Additionally, plaintiffs disputed the significance of Jose‟s deposition testimony. Although Jose acknowledged that he was told about the mass in his neck on June 2, 2005 and that he believed that it should have been diagnosed by defendants, plaintiffs argued that this testimony did not establish that, as of June 2, 2005, he was aware that defendants had done something wrong; at most, it established that Jose reached this conclusion at some point after discovering there was a mass in his neck. To support this contention, plaintiffs pointed to the following portion of Jose‟s deposition testimony:', '“[Defense Counsel]: As of that date of that visit [June 2, 2005],', 'were you thinking back to the treatment you had received in Rhode', 'Island and their failure to find this mass?', '“[Plaintiffs‟ Counsel]: Objection.', '“[Jose]: I don‟t think I was thinking of that. I was thinking what', 'had to be done in order to get me better. 2', 'More than two months after defendants first moved for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Jose amended this interrogatory answer to read as follows: “I found out that I had a cancerous tumor at the base of my spine when I got out of Intensive Care after my surgery—on or about June 21, 2005—that my previous medical providers failed to diagnose.” (Emphasis added.)', '-4-', '“[Defense Counsel]: You knew as of that visit that you had a—this', 'was a serious issue, correct?', '“[Jose]: At that particular time I didn‟t realize that that was serious,', 'but I realize [sic] it when I went to Dr. Guerrero and he told me', 'that he could not see me, that I had to go to another doctor.”3 Likewise, plaintiffs argued that Ana‟s deposition testimony as to what she believed on June 2, 2005 could not answer the question of whether Jose was aware of possible negligence at that point.', 'The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The trial justice declared that “[i]t is clear that [Jose] and [Ana], in particular [Jose], became aware of the previously undiagnosed tumor on June 2nd, 2005. At that point, the plaintiffs were undoubtedly aware of the facts that would place a reasonable person on notice that a potential claim exists * * *.” She therefore concluded that the statute of limitations began to run on June 2, 2005 and had expired before plaintiffs filed suit on June 9, 2008. Accordingly, summary judgment entered in favor of defendants. The plaintiffs appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sacco v.

Viewing “the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” we will affirm the judgment only if there exist “no genuine issues of material fact and * * * the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. at 150 (quoting Moore, 18 A.3d at 544). 3', 'In his deposition, Jose testified that Dr. Castano referred him to Dr. Guerrero “within two or three days” after the discovery of the tumor.', '-5-', 'Analysis', 'In Rhode Island, a cause of action for medical malpractice is subject to the three-year statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1-14.1. Generally, a medical-malpractice claim must be brought within three years of the date of the alleged act of malpractice. Section 9-1-14.1 (“[A]n action for medical * * * malpractice shall be commenced within three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action * * *.”). However, this general rule is not absolute; § 9-1-14.1(2) codifies the discovery rule for a subset of malpractice cases:', '“In respect to those injuries or damages due to acts of', 'medical * * * malpractice which could not in the exercise of', 'reasonable diligence be discoverable at the time of the occurrence', 'of the incident which gave rise to the action, suit shall be', 'commenced within three (3) years of the time that the act or acts of', 'the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence,', 'have been discovered.”', 'We have explained that “[t]he discovery date is the date that the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the „wrongful act‟ that is the basis of their lawsuit.” Hanson v.

Any analysis under the discovery rule employs an objective standard: “If a reasonable person in similar circumstances should have discovered that the wrongful conduct of the defendant caused [his or] her injuries as of some date before the plaintiff alleged that [he or] she made this discovery, then the earlier date will be used to start the running of the limitations period.” Id. (quoting Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 300 (R.I. 2001)); see also Moore, 18 A.3d at 544-45. “In keeping with the remedial spirit of the rule, this Court draws „all reasonable inferences‟ in [the] plaintiff‟s favor to determine whether, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, [the] plaintiff should have discovered the alleged act of malpractice.”', 'Canavan v.

Mittleman, 689 A.2d 1067, 1069 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)).', 'In this case, the parties do not dispute that the discovery rule applies to plaintiffs‟ claims. Rather, the only dispute is the precise date on which the three-year period began to run—that is, the date on which the alleged “acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.” Section 9-1-14.1(2). The defendants assert that the operative date is June 2, 2005, when Dr. Castano informed plaintiffs of the tumor that was discovered in the May 2005 MRI examination. The plaintiffs counter that the statute did not begin to run until, at the earliest, June 10, 2005, when, after Jose‟s surgery, the cancerous nature of the tumor was discovered.', 'Having carefully canvassed the entire record, as we are bound to do, we are of the opinion that the statute of limitations began to run on June 2, 2005, when Dr. Castano informed plaintiffs that Jose had a tumor in his neck that Dr. Castano suspected was a cervical tumor. The undisputed facts establish that Jose underwent a MRI examination in late May 2005 that revealed a previously undiagnosed mass in his neck; Dr. Castano diagnosed the mass as a cervical tumor, and he related this diagnosis and the MRI results to Jose and Ana on June 2, 2005. 4 On these undisputed facts, we conclude that a reasonable person would have discovered the wrongful conduct of defendants on June 2, 2005. See O‟Sullivan v. Rhode Island Hospital, 874 A.2d 179, 4', 'At oral argument, plaintiffs appeared to dispute, for the first time, whether, during his June 2, 2005 consultation with plaintiffs, Dr. Castano related his diagnosis that the mass found in Jose‟s neck was a cervical tumor. However, plaintiffs conceded that Dr. Castano‟s records of the June 2, 2005 consultation with Jose and Ana contained the phrase “cervical tumor.” Additionally, Jose admitted in his deposition that, on June 2, 2005, Dr. Castano told him that he had a mass in his neck. Moreover, plaintiffs state in their brief that “on June 2, 2005, * * * the Bustamantes first became aware of a previously undiagnosed tumor, a tumor of a still-unknown nature.” (First emphasis added.)', '-7- 182-83 (R.I. 2005) (explaining that, where the material facts are undisputed, the viability of a particular statute-of-limitations defense appropriately is decided at the summary-judgment stage); see also Hanson, 898 A.2d at 1248 (“The application of the statute of limitations is a matter of law for the trial justice to determine.” quoting Ashey, 618 A.2d at 1270); Dionne v. Baute, 589 A.2d 833, 835 (R.I. 1991). Therefore, the trial justice correctly determined that plaintiffs‟ complaint was time-barred.', 'We reach this conclusion without resort to those portions of the depositions of Jose and Ana where each appear to indicate that they believed, as of June 2, 2005, that defendants had done something wrong. Although Ana agreed with defense counsel that she first believed that Dr. Oshiro, Dr. Greenblatt, and Dr. Robertson had done something wrong when Dr. Castano told plaintiffs about the existence of the tumor, there is no evidence warranting attribution of that belief to Jose.', 'With respect to Jose‟s deposition testimony, defense counsel asked, “Then when you were told about the mass on June 2, 2005, you felt that that was the mass—that was the problem that should have been diagnosed by Dr. Greenblatt, Dr. Robertson, and Dr. Oshiro, correct?” Although Jose responded, “100 percent[,]” the clarity of the inquiry and the answer that was given are subject to debate.5 Therefore, having viewed this evidence in the light most favorable to Jose, we resolve this discrepancy in Jose‟s favor. See Canavan, 862 A.2d at 784 (“In keeping with the remedial spirit of the [discovery] rule, this Court draws „all reasonable inferences‟ in [the] plaintiff‟s favor * * *.” quoting Richmond Square Capital Corp., 689 A.2d at 1069). 5', 'The question was long and halting, and one reasonable interpretation of Jose‟s response is that, on June 2, 2005, he felt “100 percent” that the mass was the problem that should have been diagnosed by defendants. One could also interpret Jose‟s response as simply conveying that he felt “100 percent” that the mass was the problem that should have been diagnosed by defendants, not that he felt this way on June 2, 2005 in particular.', '-8-', 'Ultimately, whether Ana or Jose subjectively suspected that defendants had done something wrong is of scant relevance in the discovery-rule analysis, which focuses on the determination of “the time that the act or acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.” Section 9-1-14.1(2) (emphases added); see also Hanson, 898 A.2d at 1249 (“If a reasonable person in similar circumstances should have discovered that the wrongful conduct of the defendant caused [his or] her injuries as of some date before the plaintiff alleged that [he or] she made this discovery, then the earlier date will be used to start the running of the limitations period.” quoting Martin, 784 A.2d at 300 (emphasis added)).6', 'Furthermore, we conclude that plaintiffs‟ reliance on this Court‟s decision in Zuccolo v. Blazar, 694 A.2d 717, 717-19 (R.I. 1997), is misplaced and does not support the contention that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until, at the earliest, June 10, 2005. In Zuccolo, 694 A.2d at 718, the defendant-doctors prescribed the plaintiff a steroid without disclosing the known possible side effect of avascular necrosis, a disease of the joints. When, in 1985, after taking the steroid for several months, the plaintiff experienced joint swelling, his general practitioner—who was not a defendant—recommended that, as a precautionary measure, the plaintiff cease ingesting the medication. Id. The plaintiff‟s doctor “never specifically diagnosed avascular necrosis as being the cause of the swelling.” Id. The plaintiff followed his doctor‟s advice, but 6', 'We similarly attach no significance to plaintiffs‟ supplemental interrogatory answers. In response to one of defendants‟ interrogatories that asked for “the date on which you or anyone on your behalf first became aware of the fact that you had been harmed as a result of the defendant‟s conduct,” Jose answered, “I found out I had a tumor at the base of my spine I believe in May or June of 2005 through Dr. Ivan Castano that my previous medical providers failed to diagnose.” Although plaintiffs subsequently amended this answer to read, “I found out that I had a cancerous tumor at the base of my spine when I got out of Intensive Care after my surgery—on or about June 21, 2005—that my previous medical providers failed to diagnose[,]” this amended answer does not in any way contradict the undisputed record evidence that Jose and Ana met with Dr. Castano on June 2, 2005 and were informed then that Jose had a mass in his neck.', '-9- he nonetheless sought to discover the cause of his swelling joints. Id. Suspecting that his problems were related to the steroid, he contacted three different rheumatologists; all three diagnosed him with rheumatoid arthritis instead. Id. The plaintiff then contacted a fourth rheumatologist in December 1988 and received a MRI examination that revealed, for the first time, that the plaintiff was suffering from avascular necrosis of the hips. Id. This rheumatologist “ambiguously suggested that the avascular necrosis „can be secondary to your [the plaintiff‟s] rheumatoid arthritis or even related to previous medication.‟ [He] did not specifically mention [the plaintiff‟s] use of [the steroid] as a possible cause of the avascular necrosis.” Id. The plaintiff filed suit on July 31, 1991, and summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant- doctors on statute-of-limitations grounds. Id.', 'This Court vacated the entry of summary judgment.

The fact that the plaintiff had suspected a connection between his swelling joints and the steroid before the MRI examination did not impact our conclusion because “that suspicion had never been confirmed by, and in fact had been explicitly contradicted by, the diagnoses given by the numerous experts retained by [the plaintiff].” Id. Similarly, the fact that the fourth rheumatologist‟s diagnosis was ambiguous as to the cause of the avascular necrosis and did not mention any connection with the steroid was of no moment to our determination that the statute of limitations began to run after the MRI examination in December 1988: “The results [of the MRI examination] were the first indication to [the plaintiff] of any connection between his use of [the steroid] and his joint problems. * * * [The plaintiff‟s] diligence and persistence were rewarded when the results of his MRI scan came back and finally', '- 10 - indicated a possible connection between the [steroid] and his joint problems.” Id. (Emphases added.)', 'The critical, and indeed fatal, difference between Zuccolo and this case, however, is the time it took to file the complaint after discovering the possible connection between the injury and the defendants‟ malpractice. In Zuccolo, 694 A.2d at 719, the plaintiff filed suit on July 31, 1991, well “within three years of the December 1988 MRI scan that first alerted [the plaintiff] to the alleged wrongful conduct of the defendants * * *.” In this case, by contrast, plaintiffs filed their complaint on June 9, 2008, more than three years after their discovery of the mass in Jose‟s neck and Dr. Castano‟s diagnosis of the mass as a cervical tumor on June 2, 2005.', 'The plaintiffs argue that the date that the cancer diagnosis was confirmed—rather than the date plaintiffs were informed of the tumor—should be the discovery date for statute-of- limitations purposes. To be sure, the cancerous nature of the mass in Jose‟s neck was far from certain on June 2, 2005. The report accompanying the May 2005 MRI examination indicated several diagnostic possibilities: “Common differential considerations include chordoma, other primary or metastatic bone tumor, rheumatoid arthritis or infection. Further characterization with CT of the cervical spine is suggested.” Similarly, a “consultation note,” dated June 8, 2005, stated that “the appearance [of the mass] is consistent with a primary bone tumor such as a plasmacytoma or chordoma[;] however, numerous other diagnostic possibilities exist.”', 'This fact, however, is not dispositive.', 'The discovery rule does not require perfect crystallization of the nature and extent of the injury suffered or a clear-cut anchoring to the allegedly negligent conduct of a defendant. Rather, a medical-malpractice plaintiff is afforded three years to commence suit from “the time that the act or acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.” Section 9-1-14.1(2).', '- 11 -', 'Our decision in Zuccolo is instructive in this regard. In that case, the MRI examination revealed avascular necrosis, but the rheumatologist “ambiguously suggested” that it could be secondary to the plaintiff‟s previously diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis or related to medication. Zuccolo, 694 A.2d at 718. Moreover, the rheumatologist did not mention the steroid as a potential cause of the avascular necrosis. Id. Instead, we noted that the MRI examination in 1988 was “the first indication * * * of any connection” between the steroid and the injury and that this examination revealed only “a possible connection” at that. Id. at 719 (emphases added). Nonetheless, we determined that the date of the December 1988 MRI examination was the date on which the statute of limitations began to run: “[S]ince [the plaintiff] filed his complaint within three years of the December 1988 MRI scan that first alerted [the plaintiff] to the alleged wrongful conduct of the defendants, his action was not barred by the statute of limitations.” Id.', 'So it is here. Although the report accompanying the MRI results revealed that the mass could be a product of rheumatoid arthritis or infection, it also indicated that the mass could be “chordoma, [or] other primary or metastatic bone tumor.” Jose had been examined by several doctors over a span of more than a year and a half for his persistent neck pain; and, dissatisfied with the diagnoses he had received to that point, he sought yet another opinion on the source of his neck pain. When the subsequent MRI examination revealed a mass in his neck, which Dr. Castano diagnosed as a cervical tumor, and the diagnosis and MRI examination results were shared with plaintiffs on June 2, 2005, “a reasonable person in similar circumstances [would] have discovered that the wrongful conduct of * * * defendant[s] caused [Jose‟s] injuries * * *.” Hanson, 898 A.2d at 1249 (quoting Martin, 784 A.2d at 300).', 'The three-year statute of limitations therefore began to run on that date.', '- 12 -', 'In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that the plaintiffs will not have their day in court. Nevertheless, although the strength of a plaintiff‟s interest in seeking recompense for injuries caused by the wrongs of others cannot be gainsaid, a defendant in a malpractice case has a countervailing interest in repose. See Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 180 (R.I. 2008) (“Statutes of limitation are vital to the welfare of society and are favored in the law. They are found and approved in all systems of enlightened jurisprudence. They promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.” quoting Wood v. Carpenter, 101 U.S. 135, 139 (1879)). Statutes of limitation “are the product of a balancing of the individual person‟s right to seek redress for past grievances against the need of society and the judicial system for finality—for a closing of the books.” Id. at 181. The General Assembly legislatively has struck this balance in § 9-1-14.1. It is not a function of this Court to disrupt this equilibrium by excusing a party‟s untimeliness, even though we are sympathetic to the plaintiffs‟ ordeal.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

46,"State of Rhode Island : v. : Lead Industries Association, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. On July 1 2008, this Court issued an opinion in a civil action brought by the State of Rhode Island (plaintiff or state) against various former lead pigment manufacturers 1 and the Lead Industries Association, Inc., thus concluding what is widely considered to be the longest civil jury trial in this state’s history. See State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 434, 435 (R.I. 2008). Our decision may have resolved the underlying legal issues, but it did little to end the contention between the parties. In this opinion, we consider appeals from two Superior Court rulings concerning the apportionment of co-examiners’ fees in particular and the payment of costs in general.', 'We first consider the state’s appeal from an order of the Superior Court granting the motion of Sherwin-Williams Co., NL Industries, Inc., and Millennium Holdings, LLC (collectively defendants), for the reimbursement of all previously paid fees, costs, and expenses 1', 'The manufacturer-defendants were Sherwin-Williams Co., NL Industries, Inc., Millennium Holdings, LLC, Atlantic Richfield, Co., American Cyanamid Co. and Cytec Industries, Inc., ConAgra Grocery Products Co., and other “various defendants [that were] added or removed” throughout the history of the underlying case. State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., No. PC 99–5226, 2007 WL 711824, 2007 R.I.Super. LEXIS 32 (Feb. 26, 2007); see also State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 434 (R.I. 2008).', '-1- related to the engagement of the co-examiners. The state argues, inter alia, that as a sovereign entity, it is not responsible for such expenses under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The defendants contend that the state is liable for all expenses associated with the co-examiners because, as a plaintiff in a civil case, the state voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the court, thereby implicitly waiving any claim of sovereign immunity.', 'We then turn to defendants’ appeal from an order denying the motion of Sherwin- Williams Co., NL Industries, Inc., Millennium Holdings, LLC, ConAgra Grocery Products Co., American Cyanamid Co. and Cytec Industries, Inc., and Atlantic Richfield Co. 2 (collectively defendants) 3 for an award of allowable costs under Rule 54(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and G.L. 1956 § 9-22-5. The defendants assert that the trial justice “bypassed governing legal principles,” and, “[i]n effect, * * * treated the [s]tate as having a special status that allows it to avoid costs.”', 'Further, defendants argue that the trial justice used an unprecedented “seven-factor test to support its departure from the strong presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing parties,” and also that, in using this unprecedented test, “the trial justice manipulated it to reach an unjustifiable result * * *.” The state contends that, “through an assessment of costs, [d]efendants seek to curtail the Attorney General’s constitutional and common law obligation to protect the health and safety of citizens by initiating future ‘public interest’ lawsuits,” which, the state asserts, would have serious and far-reaching consequences. As such, the state argues that each party should be required to bear its own litigation expenses.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the orders of the Superior Court. 2', 'Although Atlantic Richfield Co. is included as a defendant in the order denying the motion for costs, it did not join in the appeal to this Court. 3', 'For the sake of simplicity, we refer to all the manufacturers involved in these two appeals as “defendants,” recognizing that not all the manufacturers who appeal from the order concerning costs are also parties to the appeal concerning co-examiners’ expenses.', '-2-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The facts and procedural history of this case can be found in detail in Lead Industries Association, Inc. In 1999, the Attorney General, on behalf of the state, filed the underlying lawsuit against various former lead pigment manufacturers and Lead Industries Association, Inc., “a national trade association of lead producers formed in 1928.” Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d at 434.', 'The trial concluded in a mistrial, but a second trial “resulted in a verdict that imposed liability on lead pigment manufacturers for creating a public nuisance.” Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d at 434. Following the entry of judgment, the state requested that the abatement process begin immediately and that the trial justice appoint examiners “to aid in the implementation of a complex remedial scheme.” Despite the fact that defendants had filed an appeal on a number of issues, the state insisted on its request for immediate action. In response to the state’s request, defendants moved for a stay of abatement proceedings, which included the appointment of any examiners, while their appeal was pending before this Court.', 'During a subsequent hearing on defendants’ motion to stay, defendants stated that there was “no question that this case and the issues involved [were] issues of first impression, unsettled questions that clearly deserve[d] to be finally treated in the appellate process.” 4 The defendants also argued that, because “the remedy [wa]s only premised on whether the liability [wa]s correct,” the abatement proceedings should not move forward until the issues on appeal were resolved by this Court. The state countered, however, that: 4', 'We note that the only official transcript submitted to this Court was of the August 15, 2008 hearing; however, copies of the additional relevant transcripts were attached to the parties’ appendices.', '-3-', '“[T]here is a continuing threat of harm that exists; exists to', 'children who live in homes that have lead hazards and potential', 'lead hazards.

And it really isn’t that much of an inconvenience to', 'the parties.', '“* * *', '“To preserve the status quo is to preserve harm to children,', 'basically.” The trial justice asked counsel for the state, “[H]ow would the [c]ourt compensate this special master * * * in the event that the Supreme Court ruled against the [s]tate’s position?” The state’s counsel replied that, “at this point in time, that should be a matter that the defendants have to pay.” Another attorney for the state then added that:', '“In the first instance, certainly that special master’s fees', 'should be paid by the defendants. In the event that, we think it’s', 'highly unlikely, that the Supreme Court would disagree with what', 'Your Honor has ruled over the last eight years, that seems to be', 'something that the defendants could at that point seek potentially', 'as a cost associated with their appeal * * * and could seek', 'reimbursement in that forum.”', 'The trial justice denied the stay and, on June 18, 2007, entered an order in which he declared defendants to be initially jointly responsible for the cost of any appointed examiners but added that the “[f]inal determination of the responsibility for such costs shall be determined by the [c]ourt.”', 'Numerous appeals were brought before this Court in 2008. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d at 434. At that time, we held that the trial justice erred when he', '-4- failed to grant defendants’ motion to dismiss, and we reversed the judgment of abatement. Id. at 458, 480.', 'In the aftermath of our opinion, several hearings were held before the trial justice on issues relating to the payment of various expenses. On August 15, 2008, the trial justice heard defendants’ motion for co-examiners’ expenses, as well as defendants’ motion for an award of allowable costs. At that hearing, defendants argued that as the prevailing parties, they were entitled to recover their costs from the state. With respect to the payment of co-examiners’ fees, they contended that they had been opposed to the engagement of examiners and that “it would be grossly unfair to require the defendants who argued vociferously against the incurring of these costs to now * * * have to bear those costs * * *.” The state argued, on the other hand, that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the court from requiring the state to pay either costs or co- examiners’ fees and also that the state had not waived immunity by filing the lawsuit.', 'In a written decision issued on January 22, 2009, the trial justice considered the co- examiners’ fees issue under Rule 53(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties * * * as the court may direct.” As an additional, independent ground for his ruling, the trial justice stated that, “as a matter of judicial estoppel, this [c]ourt will not allow the [s]tate to renege on its word and argue that it cannot be held responsible for the Co-Examiner expenses for which it had previously lobbied.” The trial justice explained that:', '“[D]uring the May 1, 2007 hearing before this [c]ourt, the [s]tate', 'was asked directly who would be responsible for the Co-Examiner', 'expenses should the Supreme Court reverse the decision and', 'vacate the judgment of abatement. * * * In response, the [s]tate', 'presented to this [c]ourt the possibility of reimbursement for those', 'cost[s]. * * * However, now, when faced with the prospect of', '-5-', 'responsibility for these costs, the [s]tate has changed its position', 'and is arguing that the Co-Examiner expenses cannot and should', 'not be imposed on the [s]tate. If the [s]tate believed it could not be', 'held responsible for these expenses, it should have expressed this', 'opinion at the May 1, 2007 hearing instead of leading the [c]ourt to', 'believe that, in the event of a reversal, the [d]efendants could seek', 'reimbursement from the [s]tate.

The state timely appealed. Also on June 28, 2010, an order entered denying defendants’ motion for costs. Final judgment entered on the same date from which defendants timely appealed. We consolidate both appeals for purposes of this opinion.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We review a trial justice’s determination relative to the allocation of costs pursuant to § 9-22-5 and Rule 54(d), as well as a ruling on the apportionment of co-examiners’ expenses under Rule 53(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, employing an abuse-of- discretion standard. Under § 9-22-5, the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs in a civil action, “except where otherwise specially provided, or as justice may require, in the discretion of the court.” Rule 54(d) also specifies that “[c]osts * * * shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party as provided by statute and by these rules unless the court otherwise specifically directs.”', 'As expressly stated, both § 9-22-5 and Rule 54(d) endow the trial justice with discretion in conducting a cost-distribution analysis. “[D]iscretion is not exercised by merely granting or denying a party’s request.” DiRaimo v. City of Providence, 714 A.2d 554, 557 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Hartman v. Carter, 121 R.I. 1, 4-5, 393 A.2d 1102, 1105 (1978)). The term “discretion,” rather, denotes action taken “in the light of reason as applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action while having regard for what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.” Id. (quoting Hartman, 121 R.I. at 5, 393 A.2d at 1105). Likewise, Rule 53(a) provides that “[t]he compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties * * * as the court may direct.”', '-7-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Co-Examiners’ Fees', 'On appeal, the state argues that the trial justice erred in reaching his conclusion that the state waived its sovereign immunity because it filed the underlying lawsuit. Additionally, the state contends that the trial justice erred when he ordered it to reimburse defendants for the costs associated with the co-examiners.', 'According to defendants, the state’s argument is flawed because, “irrespective of liability costs at the conclusion of a case, [Rule] 53(a) authorizes the Superior Court to allocate the costs of a special master among the parties at any point during the proceeding.” Moreover, defendants contend that “sovereign immunity has no role to play when the state voluntarily invokes the jurisdiction of the court, utilizes its rules and procedures to advance its tactical interest, and is then required by these same rules to pay fees when the issue goes against it.”', 'The state counters that the trial justice’s assertion of judicial estoppel was inappropriate because he “placed undue emphasis on the [s]tate’s statement to the [c]ourt that [d]efendants could seek reimbursement upon reversal.” The state argues that its suggestion to the trial justice that, if he were reversed, defendants “‘could at that point seek potentially as a cost associated with their appeal * * * and could seek reimbursement in that forum’ * * * is hardly an unequivocal waiver or statement that [d]efendants would be entitled to co-examiner costs if they succeeded on appeal.” This, the state further contends, “was merely a factual statement that defendants could file a [m]otion at a time when there was a case or controversy to address, not when there was a hypothetical situation that the trial court itself found unlikely.”', '-8-', 'The invocation of judicial estoppel is “driven by the important motive of promoting truthfulness and fair dealing in court proceedings.” D & H Therapy Associates v. Murray, 821 A.2d 691, 693 (R.I. 2003).', '“Unlike equitable estoppel, which focuses on the relationship between the parties, judicial estoppel focuses on the relationship between the litigant and the judicial system as a whole.” Id. (citing 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 34 (2000)). “The United States Supreme Court has noted that ‘[b]ecause the rule is intended to prevent improper use of judicial machinery, * * * judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion.’” Id. (quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001)). “One of the primary factors courts typically look to in determining whether to invoke the doctrine in a particular case is whether the ‘party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage * * * if not estopped.’” Id. at 694 (quoting New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 751). “Courts often inquire whether the party who has taken an inconsistent position had ‘succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.’” Id. (quoting New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750). Here, a review of the record clearly shows that the trial justice predicated his decision—granting the state’s request to appoint examiners and ordering defendants jointly responsible for all related expenses—upon the state’s representation that defendants could seek reimbursement if the judgment were to be reversed on appeal.', 'During the hearing on defendants’ motion to stay the abatement proceedings, the trial justice specifically questioned the state about which party would be responsible for the expense of the co-examiners. The state responded that “[i]n the first instance,” defendants should be responsible for the expenses, but then added that, if the judgment were to be reversed on appeal,', '-9- it “seem[ed] to be something that the defendants could at that point seek potentially as a cost associated with their appeal * * * and could seek reimbursement in that forum.” As a result, the trial justice denied the stay and reserved final judgment regarding the responsibility for the costs related to the examiners.', 'Moreover, in the trial justice’s decision regarding the allocation of co-examiners’ expenses, he explicitly stated that had the state believed that sovereign immunity would shield it from financial responsibility “it should have expressed this opinion at the May 1, 2007 hearing instead of leading the [c]ourt to believe that, in the event of a reversal, the [d]efendants could seek reimbursement from the [s]tate.” This statement unmistakably indicates to this Court that, when the trial justice ordered that defendants assume responsibility for these expenses, he substantially relied upon the state’s declaration that defendants would be able to seek reimbursement if they succeeded in their appeal.', 'Because a trial justice has discretion in applying judicial estoppel when he or she finds that a party’s inconsistent positions would create an unfair advantage, our review is deferential and considers whether judicial acceptance of that party’s subsequent position would be perceived as misleading as to either the first or second court. See Murray, 821 A.2d at 694. We are fully confident that the trial justice in this case was justified in his use of judicial estoppel. We deem the state’s initial declaration that defendants could seek reimbursement upon appellate success to be misleading when compared with the state’s subsequent sovereign-immunity argument, which would bar any reimbursement to defendants. Therefore, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s application of judicial estoppel. 5 5', 'Because we hold that the state was judicially estopped from asserting a sovereign-immunity defense against the allocation of costs related to the co-examiners, we need not consider whether', '- 10 -', 'B', 'Costs', 'With respect to the denial of defendants’ motion for costs, defendants argue that the trial justice correctly recognized the presumption of awarding costs to the prevailing party, but erred by disregarding that presumption and instead applying “a purely discretionary standard.” The defendants specifically contend that the trial justice not only used an unprecedented “seven- factor test to support [his] departure from the strong presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing parties,” but also “manipulated it to reach an unjustifiable result [in this case].”6 Specifically, defendants assert five errors committed by the trial justice: (1) “failing to apply the proper presumption and burden of proof”; (2) “applying inappropriate cost factors and ignoring relevant ones”; (3) “creating a different standard for the [s]tate than other non-prevailing parties”; (4) “failing to consider facts of record”; and (5) “speculating with respect to facts not of record.”', 'The state counters that the trial justice did not err because he looked at the totality of the circumstances to support his determination that each party should bear its own costs. The state suggests that, although “the narrow issue on appeal may be viewed as which party(s) must bear the cost of litigation, the answer to this question in the context of this case has far-reaching implications.” Additionally, the state asserts that, “through an assessment of costs, [d]efendants the trial justice erred in his determination that the state waived its sovereign immunity by initiating litigation. 6', 'The defendants suggest that the trial justice considered the following seven factors: (1) “The financial need of the prevailing party for reimbursement”; (2) “The burden that the imposition of costs would have on a non-affluent, non-prevailing party”; (3) “Any bad faith or misconduct by the prevailing party”; (4) “Good faith of the plaintiff in bringing the action”; (5) “Whether the action provided any direct or indirect benefit to the public or the victorious party”; (6) “The complexity of the matter”; and (7) “Whether imposition of costs would unduly inhibit future litigation.” We, however, decipher only four factors that the trial justice weighed, which are discussed infra.', '- 11 - seek to curtail the Attorney General’s constitutional and common law obligation to protect the health and safety of citizens by initiating future ‘public interest’ lawsuits.”', 'The trial justice acknowledged the presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing party under Rule 54(d), noting, however, that such an award is discretionary. The trial justice, quoting DLC Management Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 45 F. Supp. 2d 314, 315 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), explained that costs may be denied “upon a showing that such an award would be inequitable.” Further, he looked to the following factors: (1) whether the state’s claim was frivolous; (2) whether the state proceeded in good faith; (3) whether the award of costs “could have a chilling effect on future suits by the public raising public health or environmental concerns”; and (4) whether “substantial benefits” were conferred on “the public and the prevailing parties.” 7 As this Court has stated, a trial justice exercises proper discretion when the final determination is “in the light of reason as applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action while having a regard for what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.” Hartman, 121 R.I. at 5, 393 A.2d at 1105.', 'In his written decision, the trial justice analyzed the totality of the circumstances and found the following: (1) that the state’s claim was not frivolous or made in bad faith; (2) that the public had a heightened interest because of the physical and environmental problems lead paint presented; (3) that assigning all costs to the state could act as a penalty and deter future environmental suits; and (4) that both the public and defendants substantially benefited from the commencement of the litigation. As a result, the trial justice held that both the state and defendants were responsible for bearing their own costs. 7', 'The trial justice also noted “the severe financial position of the [s]tate”; however, he expressly clarified that this was not a basis for his decision in this case.', '- 12 -', 'After a careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the facts of this case, nor did he apply those facts inappropriately to the factors he used in reaching his conclusion. Although we need not endorse each specific factor he utilized, we conclude that he carefully considered the totality of the circumstances as well as the equities, given the significant history and multitude of issues involved in this important case. As such, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for costs was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we will not disturb the ruling of the trial justice, who conscientiously and meticulously presided over this very lengthy and complex litigation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the orders of the Superior Court.

Not surprisingly, the state maintains that the document is not privileged in any way and, therefore, it is not protected from disclosure. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court denying Sherwin-Williams’ motion for a protective order. 1', 'William Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act V, Scene 5.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The factual background of this case is set forth at length in State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428 (R.I. 2008). For the sake of brevity, we shall summarize only the facts that are relevant to the specific issues raised by this appeal.', 'A', 'Background', 'This case arises from the public-nuisance lawsuit filed by the state—in 1999—against Sherwin-Williams and other paint companies not relevant to this appeal. See Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d at 434. This Court vacated a judgment that arose from a jury verdict in favor of the state’s public-nuisance claim on July 1, 2008. After prevailing on appeal, defendants, including Sherwin-Williams, filed a motion in the Superior Court for an award of costs, pursuant to Rule 54 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. On September 24, 2008, the state filed a memorandum in opposition to defendants’ motion for costs. Among other arguments that it advanced, the state contended that the Superior Court should take into consideration that Sherwin-Williams did not suffer any financial hardship as a result of its defense in the lead-paint litigation. To support its argument, the state attached a document that will be referred to as “exhibit no. 16,” which consisted of three PowerPoint slides extracted from an eighty-slide presentation. The slides had been prepared by or under the direction of Sherwin- Williams’ Associate General Counsel-Litigation and were included in a presentation to Sherwin- Williams’ Board of Directors and senior management at a meeting that took place on October 20, 2004. The three slides at issue were entitled “Insurance And Lead Litigation,” “Reimbursement of Lead Defense Costs,” and “Potential Insurance Coverage for Lead Liabilities.”', 'In its opposition to the imposition of costs, the state sought—through these documents—to', '-2- demonstrate that Sherwin-Williams had benefited from significant insurance coverage when it defended the underlying lawsuit, and, therefore, it had not suffered any financial hardship.', 'On September 25, 2008, Sherwin-Williams received a copy of the state’s supplemental memorandum, which included exhibit no. 16. After its outside counsel 2 reviewed the filing, this dispute erupted because Sherwin-Williams took issue with the discussion in the state’s memorandum about the figures set forth in exhibit no. 16, as well as with the attachment of the document to the memorandum. Sherwin-Williams maintained that the slides were prepared by its general counsel at the request of the board of directors and, further, that they included privileged legal advice on the insurance coverage that was potentially available to defend the claims of public nuisance that had been lodged against it. Outside counsel determined that the figures in exhibit no. 16 had not been produced in any litigation or in any other public forum, and counsel further asserted that Sherwin-Williams considered the information contained therein to be privileged. The company insisted that exhibit no. 16 had been kept confidential and that it had been discussed only at a meeting of the company’s board of directors, that no notes had been taken by attendees, and that no copies of the slides had been disseminated.', 'On September 26, 2008, Sherwin-Williams’ counsel contacted counsel representing the state to inquire about how the state came to possess the slides. 3 In a response that proved to be 2', 'In this opinion, we will refer to the attorneys who represented Sherwin-Williams in the lead- paint litigation as “outside counsel.” 3', 'In attempting to learn how the state obtained the slides, Sherwin-Williams’ outside counsel made reference to a facsimile banner that ran along the top of exhibit no. 16, which indicated that a thirty-four-page facsimile had been sent to a representative of the state on September 12, 2006, from a FedEx Kinko’s store. It is noteworthy that in April 2009, Sherwin-Williams filed a lawsuit against counsel who represented the state in this litigation in the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio, 2011 WL 2601249, Case No. CV–689237 (O’Donnell, J.), in which it alleged that the state’s counsel had refused to “‘explain how it came into possession of Sherwin-Williams’ Documents and the Fax,’ or ‘identify and return all of Sherwin-Williams’', '-3- unsatisfactory to Sherwin-Williams, the state declined to provide the identity of the sender. However, the state did offer to withdraw exhibit no. 16 if, in return, Sherwin-Williams would stipulate that insurance coverage had been available to it for the expenses involved with defending the lead-paint cases. Sherwin-Williams flatly refused to do so and, in response, it filed a motion for a protective order. 4', 'There were other twists in the factual scenario: on September 26, 2008, in an effort to limit the availability of the supplemental memorandum and exhibit no. 16, Sherwin-Williams’ outside counsel contacted Jane Genova, author of a blog 5 known as “Law and More,” to whom he had previously e-mailed a copy of the state’s supplemental memorandum and exhibits for her blog. He notified Genova that the state’s supplemental memorandum contained information that he now contended was protected by the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work-product doctrine. Counsel instructed the blogger to refrain from reading the memorandum and its attached exhibit no. 16 and to not circulate it to anyone. He then provided—less than an hour later—an updated memorandum, this time bereft of exhibit no. 16. Similarly, counsel for NL Industries, a codefendant, sent the state’s supplemental memorandum to a LexisNexis representative, who was the editor for the “Mealey’s Litigation Report Lead Paint.” However, as discussed below, Sherwin-Williams’ outside counsel soon contacted the LexisNexis representative after discovering that he had a copy of the supplemental memorandum and requested that the memorandum not be made publicly available.

In his affidavit, Lebold swore that one of his responsibilities was to “ascertain and obtain for Sherwin-Williams insurance coverage for litigation expenses,” about which he “regularly advise[d] Sherwin-Williams’ Board of Directors and management at their request.” With regard to exhibit no. 16, he explained that—“in [his] role as Associate General Counsel for Sherwin- Williams”—he prepared and presented the slides to the board of directors and management “at their request to provide advice on potentially available insurance coverage under the terms of existing insurance policies.” He stated that the slides “contain[ed] [his] evaluations and opinions as counsel to Sherwin-Williams regarding insurance coverage and [were] presented to the 6', 'The state contends that the thirty-four-page facsimile was “the only Sherwin-Williams internal document in [s]tate’s counsel’s possession that was not produced through formal discovery.” 7', 'In defendant’s supplemental memorandum of law in support of its motion for protective order to prohibit disclosure or use of privileged documents, it added requests that the trial justice: (1) strike exhibit no. 16 and all discussion of it or its contents from the state’s memorandum and compel destruction of all copies of that memorandum and exhibit no. 16 in the possession of any party or its counsel; (2) order that any other person to whom a copy of the memorandum and exhibit no. 16 had been given destroy the copies and not disclose or use exhibit no. 16 or information contained therein; and (3) compel the state and its attorneys to return the document contained in exhibit no. 16 and identify and return all other Sherwin-Williams privileged documents that it or its counsel had in their possession, custody, or control and that were obtained outside of the formal discovery process.', '-5- [b]oard of [d]irectors to convey legal advice and respond to questions asked [to him] by the [b]oard of [d]irectors and management.”', 'He also averred that he “intended the documents in [e]xhibit [no.] 16 to be protected under the attorney-client privilege,” that “they contain[ed] [his] work product,” and that “[t]he * * * slides * * * were not disseminated to any individual outside of Sherwin-Williams nor were the contents of the slides discussed with any individuals outside of the Company other than attorneys for Sherwin-Williams.”', 'Finally, he noted that “[a]fter investigation, [he] * * * determined that neither the [b]oard of [d]irectors nor management produced or authorized the disclosure of [e]xhibit [no.] 16 or the PowerPoint slides and information contained in it to any person outside Sherwin-Williams, except its counsel,” and that “[t]he [b]oard and management also intended the documents and information contained in [e]xhibit [no.] 16 to be privileged and confidential”: “[n]o director was allowed to take copies of those PowerPoint slides out of the meeting,” “[t]he copies of the * * * minutes and presentations * * * [were] kept in a secure location,” and “those copies [were] available on request only to the [b]oard, management, counsel, and other approved employees.”', 'On October 1, 2008, the motion for a protective order was argued before the trial justice.

Thus, despite', 'the claims Sherwin-Williams has made about the document and the', 'actions [general counsel] undertook to create it, there remains a', 'genuine question as to whether [general counsel] was actually', 'acting as an attorney in connection with the communication at', 'issue.” In his consideration of whether the predominate purpose of the slides was to convey a legal opinion, legal services, or assistance in some legal proceeding, the trial justice observed that, by virtue of associate general counsel Lebold’s sworn affidavit, exhibit no. 16 was, in fact, created primarily for the purpose of rendering a legal opinion or providing legal services to the board. However, he concluded that before making a final decision about whether the document should be adorned with the cloak of privilege, he would permit the state to question, through limited discovery, the assertions set forth in general counsel’s sworn affidavit with regard to the creation, contents, use, and purpose of exhibit no. 16.', 'In accordance with the trial justice’s order, the state propounded interrogatories and document requests on Sherwin-Williams. The answers provided by Sherwin-Williams to those requests asserted that general counsel had prepared the information contained in exhibit no. 16, although a former employee had assisted in formatting and styling the PowerPoint slides. The answers also disclosed that the company had no knowledge that any copies of the board of directors’ presentation had left the company’s control and that only two paper copies had been retained after the board of directors’ meeting.', 'Those paper copies, Sherwin-Williams maintained, were secured under lock and key. Further, it avowed that no notes had been taken', '-8- during the board meeting and that potential insurance coverage had not been discussed with or reported to any shareholders or others not present at the board meeting.', 'On September 9, 2009, the trial justice—after reviewing the supplemental discovery— issued an oral decision in which he denied Sherwin-Williams’ motion for a protective order.

Accordingly, Sherwin- Williams requests that this Court vacate the trial justice’s decision and remand the case for entry of an order granting its motion for a protective order.', 'Conversely, the state argues that exhibit no. 16 is not protected by either the attorney- client communication privilege or the work-product doctrine because it consists merely of numbers and facts, and it is devoid of any legal analysis. The state also argues that any privilege to which the documents may have been entitled had been waived because exhibit no. 16 was not included in a privilege log that had been completed in connection with the underlying litigation, because counsel for Sherwin-Williams provided the state’s supplemental memorandum with exhibit no. 16 to two different reporters and because there were third parties present at the board of directors’ meeting.', 'The work-product doctrine affords broader protection than the attorney-client privilege. See State v. von Bulow, 475 A.2d 995, 1009 (R.I. 1984). As we begin our analysis, we make the initial observation that the trial justice did not make a clear determination as to whether exhibit no. 16 should be protected under the work-product doctrine. However, because the record before us is sufficient and because, in any event, our review is de novo, we are able to thoroughly consider the issue. 11 11', 'Although our usual practice would be to remand the matter to the Superior Court for further factfinding, we deem it appropriate to decide this issue because of the prolonged travel of this case and because the issue is relatively straightforward.

Arruda, 556 A.2d 47, 49 (R.I. 1989)). But “it is not necessary for litigation to have been initiated for a party to successfully invoke the work-product privilege afforded by Rule 26”; work product applies to documents prepared principally or exclusively to assist in anticipated or ongoing litigation. Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1247; see also Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 511-12 (1947).', 'There are two distinct categories of work product that are protected by the work-product doctrine. See Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1247. The first category—often termed “opinion” work product—“refers to a document or other written material containing the mental impressions of an attorney or his or her legal theories.” Id. Because it includes the actual thoughts of the attorney, opinion work product receives the highest level of protection: it “qualifies for absolute immunity', '- 12 - from discovery and under no circumstance may another party obtain, through discovery methods, an attorney’s recorded thoughts and theories.” Id.', 'A different, lesser level of protection applies to the second category of work product— “factual” work product. Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1248. Factual work product covers a wider spectrum than opinion work product: it encompasses “any material gathered in anticipation of litigation.” Id. Indeed, this may apply even to nonattorneys; “[i]t is not necessary for the attorney to have prepared the materials or the documents for them to constitute work product.” Id. The rationale for this protection is to “prevent an attorney from ‘freeloading’ on his or her adversary’s work.” Id. (quoting Cabral, 556 A.2d at 48). Factual work product is afforded only qualified immunity from discovery because it does not include the actual thoughts or mental impressions of the attorney. Id. When determining whether a particular document qualifies as factual work product, the party asserting the doctrine has the burden of establishing that the document was prepared in anticipation of litigation. Gaumond v. Trinity Repertory Co., 909 A.2d 512, 517 (R.I. 2006). Once the party asserting the work-product doctrine has established that the document was prepared in anticipation of litigation, the party seeking discovery of the document must demonstrate (1) that it has substantial need for the materials in preparation of its case and (2) that it is unable to obtain the information by other means without undue hardship. Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co. v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838, 842 (R.I. 2006).', 'At issue here is whether exhibit no. 16 constitutes work product. Sherwin-Williams argues that exhibit no. 16 contains opinion work product, derived from its general counsel’s legal analysis of insurance policies, and that the trial justice erroneously failed to credit the general counsel’s affidavit. The state argues that exhibit no. 16 contains only facts and business-related', '- 13 - information, as opposed to legally-related facts, and therefore—even though exhibit no. 16 may have been prepared by, or at the direction of, an in-house counsel—it is not protected by the work-product doctrine. The state also argues that exhibit no. 16 should not be protected under factual work product, because in that instance the work-product doctrine applies only if a document was prepared in “anticipation of litigation,” and here there was no anticipated litigation during the relevant time. The state also adds that exhibit no. 16 contains otherwise discoverable facts, i.e., “insurance information,” and, because Sherwin-Williams produced its insurance information during discovery, as required by Rhode Island law, exhibit no. 16 should have been produced and the work-product doctrine does not apply.', 'In our opinion, exhibit no. 16 cannot be considered to be opinion work product because it does not reflect the thoughts, opinions, or conclusions of general counsel. On its face, exhibit no. 16 seems merely to provide updates on insurance considerations for the ongoing lead paint litigation. There appears to be nothing that is reflective of legal advice or legal issues, nor do the slides reveal any confidential communications made by the board of directors or management to general counsel. Accordingly, there is no reason to conclude that exhibit no. 16 itself—as distinguished from whatever oral advice may have been given by the attorneys to the client during the course of the meeting—constitutes legal advice.', 'However, with regard to the second category—factual work product—it is our opinion that Sherwin-Williams has met its burden. The record is uncontroverted that exhibit no. 16 was prepared at the request of the board of directors during its quest for advice about the insurance coverage that was available to the company for the pending lead-paint litigation. The board of directors’ meeting took place in October 2004, approximately five years after the lead paint litigation had been initiated and approximately four years before Sherwin-Williams filed its', '- 14 - motion for an award of costs. See, e.g., United States v. Construction Products Research, Inc., 73 F.3d 464, 473 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[A] party generally must show that the documents were prepared principally or exclusively to assist in anticipated or ongoing litigation.” (emphasis added)). Nothing in the record suggests that general counsel previously had commissioned this sort of investigation, nor is there any indication that this investigation was solicited for any reason other than for the pending lead-paint litigation. We, therefore, conclude that exhibit no. 16 was prepared in anticipation of litigation and that it falls within the protective embrace of Rule 26(b)(3). See Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1248-49.', 'Having determined that the documents qualify as factual work product, the next step in our analysis is to determine whether precluding discovery would lead to injustice or undue hardship, an issue vested in the sound discretion of the trial justice. See Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co., 120 R.I. at 754, 391 A.2d at 90. Because he found that the documents were not privileged in any way, the trial justice did not engage in that analysis. However, we have determined that the appellate record is sufficient for this Court to reach its own conclusion that the state could not overcome the burden of establishing injustice or undue hardship. The burden of demonstrating that the protected document nevertheless is discoverable because of substantial need and a resulting injustice or undue hardship is on the party seeking discovery. Id. at 754, 391 A.2d at 90. At oral argument, the state acknowledged that it could have garnered the information contained in exhibit no. 16 on its own from the insurance policies that Sherwin- Williams produced during discovery. Accordingly, because the state was not foreclosed from obtaining material equivalent to exhibit no. 16 from other avenues, we hold that the state has not met its burden of establishing undue hardship. See Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1248.', '- 15 -', 'In addition, we note that the state cannot demonstrate a substantial need for the data in exhibit no. 16. In reviewing the trial justice’s decisions allocating costs, we observe that he did not give significant weight to exhibit no. 16. Specifically, in his final decision of May 25, 2010, the trial justice considered Sherwin-Williams’ motion, pursuant to Rule 54(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking an award of the costs that it incurred during litigation. The trial justice noted the factors to be weighed in determining whether to award costs, including', '“the financial need of the prevailing party for reimbursement, the', 'burden that the imposition of costs would have on a non-affluent,', 'non-prevailing party, any bad faith or misconduct by the prevailing', 'party during the litigation, * * * the good faith of the plaintiff in', 'filing the action[,] * * * [and] the ‘equities and public interests at', 'stake.’” Then the trial justice concluded that, based on the totality of the circumstances—which he clarified to include the state’s good faith in commencing and pursuing the litigation, that substantial benefits had been conferred on both the public and Sherwin-Williams, and that imposition of all costs on the state would act as an unnecessary penalty—each party should bear its own costs. Indeed, the trial justice specifically said that he was not taking the parties’ finances into account. Accordingly, we hold that the state has failed to establish its substantial need for Sherwin-Williams’ work product.', 'C', 'Waiver', 'The state argues that even if the work-product doctrine applies, Sherwin-Williams waived its claim of protection in three separate ways: (1) by including third parties in the board of directors’ meeting where exhibit no. 16 was presented; (2) by disclosing exhibit no. 16 to a blogger and a LexisNexis representative; and (3) by failing to include exhibit no. 16 in the privilege log prepared in the underlying litigation.

Specifically, the state argues that these third parties, by virtue of their job titles—the senior vice president of human resources, the vice president and controller of the consumer division, and the president of the international division—could not have added anything in the way of input on the alleged legal advice with regard to exhibit no. 16 or the lead litigation. Sherwin-Williams argues that the officers were not third parties to Sherwin-Williams and, therefore, their presence did not waive any protection.', 'Because “the purpose of the work-product rule ‘is not to protect the evidence from disclosure to the outside world but rather to protect it only from the knowledge of opposing counsel and his client,’” it follows that “disclosure of [work-product information] to third persons does not waive the work product immunity.” 8 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2024 at 531, 532 (3d ed. 2010); see von Bulow, 475 A.2d at 1009 (explaining that “because it looks to the vitality of the adversary system rather than simply seeking to preserve confidentiality, the work[-]product privilege is not automatically waived by any disclosure to a third party” (quoting In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 809 (D.C. Cir. 1982))). There is no waiver where the transferor of the protected information and the recipient of that information are coparties or where they share interests in a matter litigated against a common adversary. See, e.g., 8 Wright and Miller, § 2024 at 532 & n.67. However, a disclosure to a third party that substantially increases the likelihood that protected content would be revealed to an adverse party might waive the work-product protection. Id. at 532.', '- 17 -', 'In this case, it is our opinion that Sherwin-Williams did not waive work-product protection because of the disclosure of the disputed information to senior management personnel who attended the meeting of the board of directors. Disclosure to them did not substantially increase the likelihood that the protected content would be revealed to an adverse party. Accordingly, we hold that Sherwin-Williams did not waive the work-product protection because of the presence of the holders of three top-management positions at the board of directors’ meeting.', '2', 'Media Sources', 'Similarly, the state argues that disclosure of exhibit no. 16 and the state’s supplemental memorandum to a blogger and a LexisNexis representative waived any protection. The state contends that Sherwin-Williams took no precautions to ensure that exhibit no. 16 would remain confidential or would not be disclosed to the public. Sherwin-Williams responds that this limited disclosure of the state’s memorandum and exhibit no. 16 did not waive the protection because it was the state’s improper actions that put exhibit no. 16 in the public arena. Sherwin-Williams maintains that it treated exhibit no. 16 as privileged at all times: it employed numerous safeguards to preserve its privileged status, never authorized its disclosure, and acted diligently and reasonably to recover exhibit no. 16 as soon as it discovered that the state had wrongfully published it in a public filing.', 'As discussed above, disclosure of work-product information to third parties does not waive the protection, unless that disclosure substantially increases the likelihood that the information would be revealed to an adverse party. 8 Wright & Miller, § 2024 at 532. When an attorney freely and voluntarily discloses the contents of otherwise protected work product to someone with interests adverse to his or those of his client—knowingly increasing the possibility', '- 18 - that an opponent will obtain and use the material—he may be deemed to have waived work product protection. Id.', 'Here, we hold that Sherwin-Williams did not freely or voluntarily disclose the content of exhibit no. 16. It is undisputed by the parties that exhibit no. 16 was obtained independent of the formal discovery process.', 'In fact, the state admitted that it obtained exhibit no. 16 “during [its] own efforts” outside of the formal discovery process.', 'After Sherwin-Williams discovered that exhibit no. 16 was attached to the state’s supplemental memorandum, outside counsel took prompt, affirmative steps to protect the information contained in exhibit no. 16: it contacted counsel representing the state to inquire how the state came to possess the slides; it contacted both the blogger and the LexisNexis representative to request that each destroy the document and to confirm that neither had disseminated or disclosed the document; it contacted the Superior Court clerk to verify that the state’s supplemental memorandum and exhibit no. 16 were not available in the public case file; and it conducted a thorough Internet search to ensure that the supplemental memorandum and exhibit no. 16 were not otherwise available.', 'The state argues that Sherwin-Williams waived any protection because it resent the state’s supplemental memorandum to Genova, which included a discussion of the very facts contained in exhibit no. 16. It certainly appears that Sherwin-Williams’ outside counsel failed to adequately screen the supplemental memorandum before resending it to Genova. That error, however, does not reflect a pattern of carelessness; neither does it evidence an intent or willingness to waive the protections of the work-product doctrine. Even if Sherwin-Williams’ outside counsel did not adequately screen the memorandum, the fact that counsel undertook a screening procedure indicates that there was precaution to avoid disclosure of privileged', '- 19 - material. Further, outside counsel promptly objected to the disclosure after discovering it, suggesting a genuine intent to preserve confidentiality. There is no evidence that Sherwin- Williams ever intended to disclose exhibit no. 16. Indeed, the exhibit came into the state’s hands only because—unknown to Sherwin-Williams or its counsel—an unauthorized source disclosed the document. In our opinion, the record clearly establishes that Sherwin-Williams intended to keep exhibit no. 16 confidential. Accordingly, we hold that Sherwin-Williams’ disclosure to the blogger and the LexisNexis representative did not waive any work-product protection.', '3', 'Privilege Log', 'Finally, the state argues that any protection that might have been afforded was waived because Sherwin-Williams failed to include the document in its privilege log. Sherwin-Williams argues that exhibit no. 16 was not required to be listed in a privilege log because the state never requested documents that fit the description of exhibit no. 16 during the discovery phase of the case.', 'A party who withholds discovery materials must provide sufficient information, usually in the form of a privilege log, to enable the other party to evaluate the applicability of protection. Indeed, Rule 26(b)(5) states that:', '“[w]hen a party withholds information otherwise discoverable', 'under these rules by claiming that it is privileged * * * the party', 'shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the nature of the', 'documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed', 'in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or', 'protected, will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the', 'privilege or protection.” The party withholding discovery material must be specific enough in its privilege log to support its claim of protection and to provide a means to assess the claim. Rule 37(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that if a party withholding material fails to adequately', '- 20 - state the reasons for an objection, he or she may be held to have waived the objections, including those based on privilege. However, courts assessing the adequacy of a privilege log “should avoid hair-trigger findings of waiver.” 8B Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2213 at 185 (3d ed. 2010). Minor procedural violations, good-faith attempts at compliance, and other such mitigating circumstances militate against finding waiver.', 'Further, a party is required to provide a privilege log detailing the documents, communications, or things not produced that are “otherwise discoverable.” A document is not otherwise discoverable if it is irrelevant, immaterial, overbroad, or never requested in the document request. Indeed, Rule 34 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a recipient of a request for discovery is under a duty to provide only the documents or information that are responsive to the request and that are within its possession, custody, or control. See 1 Robert B. Kent et al., Rhode Island Civil and Appellate Procedure § 34:6 (West 2004 & 2011 supp.). Accordingly, nonresponsive documents are not required to be reported in a privilege log.', 'Here, in the state’s request for production of documents, it asked for “[p]roduc[tion of] any insurance agreement under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in this action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment” and “all minutes of meetings of the [b]oard of [d]irectors or other corporate entity of the [d]efendant concerning, relating to, or referencing the health effects of exposure to, inhalation of, or ingestion of [l]ead.” 12 The state also propounded interrogatories on Sherwin-Williams, asking it the following: 12', 'Although the requests by the state for production of documents and interrogatories took place in 2001—approximately three years before the October 2004 board of directors’ meeting where exhibit no. 16 was presented—Sherwin-Williams would have had a continuing duty to produce', '- 21 -', '“Do you have one or more policies of liability insurance that afford', 'you coverage for the claims that are the subject of this action? If', 'so, please state as to each policy:', '“a. the name of the insurer;', '“b. the type of policy (including whether it is a', 'primary or excess policy);', '“c. the number of the policy and the named', 'insured(s);', '“d. the limits of the policy;', '“e. the effective dates of the policy.” Sherwin-Williams explained that it interpreted these requests, in good faith, to be for the production of the actual insurance policies and not the information contained in exhibit no. 16 regarding reimbursement and potential insurance coverage. Accordingly, Sherwin-Williams responded by producing copies of responsive insurance policies, “[s]ubject to and without waiving any of its objections.”', 'After reviewing the record, we agree with Sherwin-Williams that the state never requested information or documents that fit the description of the content contained in exhibit no. 16. Although the state requested policy identification numbers and limits of coverage, it did not request specific information regarding reimbursed costs or the insurance that was potentially available. Even though the existence and contents of an insurance agreement are discoverable pursuant to Rule 26(b)(2), 13 we hold that it was reasonable for Sherwin-Williams to interpret that exhibit no. 16 if the state requested such information. Indeed, Rule 33(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides,', '“[i]f the party furnishing answers to interrogatories subsequently', 'shall obtain information which renders such answers incomplete or', 'incorrect, amended answers shall be served within a reasonable', 'time thereafter but not later than 30 days prior to the day fixed for', 'trial. Thereafter amendments may be allowed only on motion and', 'upon such terms as the court may direct.” 13', 'Rule 26(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, that', '“[a] party may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of', 'any insurance agreement under which any person carrying on an', '- 22 - the interrogatory and document requests were limited to the actual insurance policies and did not encompass the information contained in exhibit no. 16. Contrary to the state’s assertion, even if exhibit no. 16 was directly related to the amount of insurance carried by Sherwin-Williams, the information contained in it was not responsive to the state’s particular discovery requests.', 'The state further argues, however, that it specifically requested PowerPoint presentations to be produced before or at the depositions of four different individuals in 2005.', 'Sherwin- Williams contends that, in good faith, it interpreted the request to be limited to documents that the four deponents had in their possession and that were responsive to their anticipated testimony.', 'After reviewing the discovery requests, we hold that Sherwin-Williams reasonably interpreted the discovery requests to be those documents in the deponents’ custody and control. The state requested that each witness produce before or at his deposition any documents in his possession, custody, or control responsive to requests for documents appended to each notice of deposition. The specific request at issue included “[a]ll documents in your possession, custody or control concerning or relating to lead, lead paint, lead pigment, lead poisoning and/or human exposure to lead from any source that he has not previously produced in this lawsuit” for all four deponents, and “[a]ll unpublished papers, studies, articles, presentations, slides, speeches[,] or other materials authored or prepared by [the deponent] * * * related to [l]ead” for only two of those deponents. However, because the four deponents were not present at the October 2004 board of directors’ meeting, and also because the four deponents did not have physical possession or a legal right to obtain copies of exhibit no. 16, Sherwin-Williams was not required', 'insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment', 'which may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse', 'for payments made to satisfy the judgment.”', '- 23 - to produce the PowerPoint presentation from October 2004. See Rule 34(a) (requiring a party to produce any designated documents that are within its “possession, custody or control” and that are relevant to the subject of the litigation); see also 1 Kent, § 34:2 (A party’s legal right to obtain a copy determines whether a document is considered to be in his or her possession, custody, or control.). Accordingly, the document requests made by the state did not require the production of exhibit no. 16, and, therefore, Sherwin-Williams was not required to include it on its privilege log.', 'Further, we note that Sherwin-Williams’ outside counsel did make an effort to provide documents that they believed, in good faith, were responsive to the discovery requests and not privileged or protected. Sherwin-Williams also objected to the document requests that they believed were overly broad as well as requests for documents that they believed were protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or other applicable privilege. Sherwin-Williams even enclosed a third supplement to its master privilege log, which was thorough and already hundreds of pages in length. 14 See Rule 26(f) (every counsel is charged with conducting discovery in good faith).', 'The state argues, however, that other Sherwin-Williams’ employees and its attorneys were aware of the existence of exhibit no. 16, yet the company failed to produce it. Among these employees was Cheryl Rampelt, a Sherwin-Williams employee who searched for documents that were potentially responsive to requests in the lead litigation.', 'However, the deposition of Rampelt took place on October 7, 1997—approximately seven years before the October 2004 board of directors’ meeting.', 'Her testimony about document collection from 1997 reveals 14', 'The state conceded that Sherwin-Williams provided a lengthy and thorough privilege log that “was hundreds of pages” in length and “was actually one of the more complete logs that we received in terms of information.”', '- 24 - nothing about the relevance, handling, or treatment of documents that were not created until seven years later. Contrary to the state’s assertion, this testimony does not support a conclusion that Sherwin-Williams was aware of exhibit no. 16 and consciously failed to produce it or include it on the privilege log. In any event, as discussed above, Sherwin-Williams was not required to produce exhibit no. 16 or to include it on the privilege log because the information contained therein was not responsive to the state’s discovery requests.', 'Accordingly, after reviewing the state’s discovery requests and responses, as well as taking into consideration Sherwin-Williams’ continuing efforts throughout the litigation to maintain a thorough privilege log, we hold that it would unfairly penalize Sherwin-Williams in this case to conclude that its work product was waived simply because Sherwin-Williams, in good faith, did not include exhibit no. 16 on its privilege log. Accordingly, Sherwin-Williams’ failure to include exhibit no. 16 on its privilege log did not waive the work-product protection.', 'III', 'Attorney-Client Privilege', 'Because we hold that the slides were protected under the work-product doctrine and that this doctrine was not waived, we do not reach the claim of attorney-client privilege.

The plaintiff, Elizabeth Morel, filed a civil action against the City of Providence (city) 1 for personal injuries she suffered after a school bus that she was operating fell into a sinkhole on a city roadway. A jury trial was held in the Superior Court, which resulted in a verdict finding that the defendant was negligent and awarding the plaintiff $59,239 in damages.', 'On appeal, the city argues that the trial justice erred “in admitting affidavits that failed to conform to the express requirement of [G.L. 1956 § 9-19-27] that they must be sworn to under penalty of perjury.” The city additionally argues that the trial justice clearly abused her discretion by preventing it “from pursuing its well disclosed and announced intention to cross-examine the [p]laintiff during trial as to her receipt of workers[’] compensation” benefits. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further 1', 'The original complaint filed in Superior Court lists only the city as a defendant; however, the amended complaint adds Stephen Napolitano, in his capacity as the city’s treasurer, as a defendant.', '-1- briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On April 5, 2006, Morel was operating a school bus on Fairview Street in the city of Providence when the front wheels of the bus fell into a trench. Evidence was presented at trial that employees of the Providence Water Supply Board (Providence Water), a public utility and agency of the city, had installed a temporary patch in the road after completing a “remove and install service” on the pipes that ran underneath the area; however, the trench had “washed out” due to a heavy rainfall, causing the patch to fail.', 'Morel filed a complaint against the city on October 20, 2006. In an amended complaint filed on December 1, 2006, Morel alleged that the city, through Providence Water, had been negligent, careless, and reckless when it excavated the roadway. A jury trial was held on March 1-4, 2010, and a verdict was returned for Morel. A judgment was entered on March 4, 2010, awarding Morel $59,239. Subsequently, the trial justice awarded Morel costs in the amount of $5,738.45. The city filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews questions of statutory construction and interpretation de novo. Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012). When the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we give the words their plain and ordinary meaning. Id.

Further, Morel contends that the words “under the penalties of perjury” are not used in depositions, when a person is sworn in during court proceedings, or within answers to interrogatories, nor are they required within an affidavit supporting a search warrant or by the perjury statute, G.L. 1956 § 11-33-1. Lastly, she points out that “[§] 9-19-27 expressly allows for the calling of any of the affiants by an opposing party” so that they may be questioned “as to whether the information contained in the affidavits was accurate,” but she notes that the city did not do so.', 'This Court has stated that “[s]ection 9-19-27 provides a mechanism for admission of opinion evidence through documentation, without the need for expert testimony.” Boscia v. Sharples, 860 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2004). Although the statutory language clearly requires that the documentary evidence be “subscribed and sworn to under the penalties of perjury,” it does not expressly require that this exact phrase be used. The General Assembly, in at least two other instances, has mandated by statute that certain documents include the phrase “under penalties of perjury.” See G.L. 1956 § 23-19-13.1(c) (“The certification * * * shall be under oath, stating that the oath is made under the pains and penalties of perjury.”); G.L. 1956 § 44-40-5 (“The [tax] return shall contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury.”). Such is not the case here. The language used in § 9-19-27(b), “subscribed and sworn', 'diagnosis of the physician or dentist, [or] the prognosis of the', 'physician or dentist * * *.”', '-4- to under the penalties of perjury,” creates the requirement that the documents be sworn to under oath. Black’s Law Dictionary defines the word “swear” as “[t]o take an oath,” and the word “oath” as “[a] solemn declaration * * * that one’s statement is true,” the legal effect of which is to “subject the person to penalties for perjury if the testimony is false.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1585, 1176 (9th ed. 2009). The word “perjury” is defined as “[t]he act or an instance of a person’s deliberately making material false or misleading statements while under oath.” Id. at 1254.', 'This Court has previously stated that “[o]ur legal system treats with great seriousness a statement that has been sworn to before a notary public. Statements sworn to in affidavits can have immensely serious consequences.” Scarborough v. Wright, 871 A.2d 937, 939 n.4 (R.I. 2005); see also In re Testa, 489 A.2d 331, 335 (R.I. 1985) (“Because the affidavit was sworn to before a notary public, the statements asserted therein were regarded as truthful and the document is therefore available as evidence of the facts stated.”). The potential consequence of knowingly swearing to an untruthful statement made within an affidavit is a conviction for perjury. Section 11-33-1(a) (“Every person under oath or affirmation who knowingly makes any false material declaration or makes or uses any other information * * * knowing it contains any false material declaration, shall be deemed guilty of perjury.”).', 'Therefore, any statement, whether oral or written, when given under oath, is sworn to under the penalties of perjury.', 'The city attempts to support its argument by citing to Scarborough, 871 A.2d at 939 (holding that the defendant’s affidavit did not sufficiently satisfy the requirements of Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because of the “plaintiff’s failure to have abided by', '-5- the clear and specific language of Rule 56”), 3 and Chrysler First Financial Services Corp. v. Van Daam, 604 A.2d 339, 341 n.1 (R.I. 1992) (noting that the unsigned statement presented by the defendant did not meet the requirements of an affidavit because it was “devoid of an acknowledgment that the assertions made within [were] sworn to before a notary”). The city’s reliance upon these cases is misplaced, however.', 'In Scarborough, 871 A.2d at 938, the plaintiff presented an affidavit that was not notarized and, therefore, we deemed it not to constitute a sufficient affidavit for purposes of Rule 56. This Court defined an affidavit to be “a written or printed declaration or statement of facts, made voluntarily, and confirmed by the oath or affirmation of the party making it, taken before a person having authority to administer such oath or affirmation.” Id. at 939 (quoting State v. Haase, 530 N.W.2d 617, 618 (Neb. 1995)). In Van Daam, 604 A.2d at 341 n.1, we said that an unsworn statement was not sufficient to meet the requirements of an affidavit because the document “merely contain[ed] the acknowledgment of a notary that [the defendant’s] signature [was] his free act and deed” and was “devoid of an acknowledgment that the assertions made within are sworn to before a notary.” Here, the affidavits that Morel presented were clearly signed in the presence of a notary by each affiant and each expressly states that the truth of the factual statements within each affidavit was sworn to under oath. Because the affidavits were subscribed and sworn to under oath in the presence of a notary, we are of the opinion that the 3', 'Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, states, in pertinent part, that an affidavit', '“shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as', 'would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that', 'the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.', 'Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to', 'in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.”', '-6- legislative requirements contained in § 9-19-27 have been met, and that the trial justice did not err in admitting the affidavits into evidence at the trial. 4', 'B', 'Workers’ Compensation Benefits', 'On appeal, the city also contends that the trial justice clearly abused her discretion by preventing it “from pursuing its well disclosed and announced intention to cross-examine the [p]laintiff during trial as to her receipt of workers[’] compensation.” Before the commencement of trial, by way of a motion in limine, the city sought to introduce evidence that Morel, ignoring medical advice that she was able to return to work, instead chose to remain out of work until the start of the following school year, all the while receiving workers’ compensation benefits. The city maintained that, “[t]o a layman, that raises a suspicion that the plaintiff was interested in remaining out of work for the summer, and the fact she received Worker’s [sic] Compensation benefits during that time made it more tenable for her to do so.” After offering Soucy v. Martin, 121 R.I. 651, 402 A.2d 1167 (1979), and Bookbinder v. Rotondo, 109 R.I. 346, 285 A.2d 387 (1972), to support its contention that “the [c]ourt is not bound by the Collateral Source Rule to prohibit any mention of [the benefits],” the city requested that the court “take a wait-and-see approach” to determine whether the collateral-source rule prohibited testimony concerning Morel’s receipt of workers’ compensation benefits. The plaintiff contended that evidence of the benefits was clearly inadmissible under Rule 409 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 5 The 4', 'Although defendant suggests in its supplemental Rule 12A statement that it “should have had the opportunity to cross[-]examine the ‘affiant’ regarding the assertions made in the statements,” we need not address this argument since we have determined that the affidavits conformed to the requirements of § 9-19-27. 5', 'Rule 409 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states that “[e]vidence of furnishing or offering or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury.”', '-7- trial justice stated that she did not find the above-cited cases to be “on point” and that she was “not going to allow it at [that] point in time.” She also told the city that, “during trial, if anything comes up that would change that, you certainly can renew your motion at that time,” but she thought there were “ample grounds for cross-examination as to [plaintiff’s] motives” and the reasons for her return to work that the city could argue to the jury.', 'During the trial, while on direct examination, Morel testified that she had tried to go back to work, but that her doctor told her she could not. Morel was asked when that occurred and replied: “I wanted to go back to work because I was paying all my bills with my credit card.” Subsequently, on cross-examination, Morel was asked, “I believe you had said that while you were out of work you had to pay all your bills with a credit card?” to which Morel responded, “Yes.” A sidebar conference took place, at which the city argued that the statement Morel made during direct examination opened the door to the introduction of the fact that she was receiving workers’ compensation benefits while she was not working. The trial justice determined that Morel’s comment had not been responsive to the question posed to her and that the city could have moved to strike the comment, but did not do so.', 'On appeal, the city argues that evidence of plaintiff’s receipt of workers’ compensation benefits “was not to be offered nakedly for prejudicial value[;] rather, it was to be part of a presentation that included other facts of a prolonged recovery and late diagnosis of a head injury that tended to insulate [p]laintiff from the evidence of her slow recovery.” The city, quoting Capezza v. Hertz Equipment Rental Corp., 118 R.I. 1, 6, 371 A.2d 269, 272 (1977), contends that the trial justice’s decision was erroneous because the evidence should have been allowed “in order to affect the weight of plaintiff’s testimony as [she] attempted to establish causation', '-8- between the alleged injuries and the accident * * *.” Morel counters that the evidence of workers’ compensation benefits was properly excluded as classic collateral source material.', 'In Bookbinder, 109 R.I. at 357, 285 A.2d at 393, this Court held that the collateral-source rule was not an absolute bar to the introduction of evidence that the plaintiff was paid by an employer during a period of disability when the evidence was offered to show that the plaintiff was not disabled or was, in fact, working. In the case under review, the record indicates that the trial justice ruled that the evidence concerning Morel’s receipt of workers’ compensation benefits during her time out of work was inadmissible because it was not offered to disprove her disability or to establish that she was in fact working. The trial justice also noted that the defendant was permitted to question Morel about whether she normally worked during the summer and that the defendant was entitled to reasonable inferences. Furthermore, the trial justice ruled that the basis proffered by the city for the admission of the evidence (i.e., that the plaintiff had an incentive to not return to work) was not sufficient under Bookbinder. We agree and perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s ruling that the collateral-source rule excluded the evidence of Morel’s receipt of workers’ compensation benefits.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Hazard previously had been convicted of one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1,1 and four counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.3.2', 'Before this Court, Hazard contends that his application for postconviction relief should have been granted based on what he argues was prejudicial error committed by his trial counsel when he provided Hazard‟s confidential psychiatric records to the state without his knowledge or consent, failed to attempt to limit the state‟s use of the psychiatric records or to object to the state‟s use of the records, failed to introduce the psychiatric records himself to buttress Hazard‟s defense, and failed to adequately prepare Hazard for cross- examination on the psychiatric records. Hazard further contends that his trial counsel was 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.1 provides: “A person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” 2', 'Section 11-37-8.3 provides: “A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.”', '-1- deficient because he pursued an argument at trial about racial animosity that Hazard believed should not have been used and because his trial counsel failed to object to what Hazard argues was improper credibility attacks and improper vouching during the prosecutor‟s closing argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The underlying facts of this case are discussed at length in State v. Hazard, 785 A.2d 1111 (R.I. 2001). For the sake of brevity, this Court will only discuss those facts relevant to the issues on appeal.', 'A', 'Background', 'The incidents underlying this case occurred in 1993 and 1994. At that time, Hazard, who was divorced with three sons, lived with his fiancée, Carla, and her daughter Lisa,3 who was between eleven and twelve years old. Hazard worked a day shift as a postal worker, and Carla was a waitress who worked an evening shift three or four nights per week from approximately 4:30 p.m. to midnight. When Carla worked evening shifts, Hazard was alone with Lisa. Hazard also cared for Lisa when Carla was hospitalized on two separate occasions, once in 1993 for over one week, and the second time in 1994 for at least two weeks.', 'The evidence at trial demonstrated that during the times Hazard was alone with Lisa, he began coming into her room as she prepared for bed. Her bedtime was approximately 9 p.m., at which time she would occasionally apply a moisturizing lotion. Hazard began to ask if he could put the lotion on her. At first, he applied the lotion on only her back, but eventually he began 3', 'To protect the privacy of the complaining witness, we have given her a pseudonym.', '-2- rubbing lotion on her breasts underneath her clothing. The touching escalated to where he was licking her ears and kissing her breasts and neck, all the while explaining that he was showing her the locations of “horny spots.” A number of times, he also touched her buttocks, and on three occasions, according to Lisa‟s testimony at trial, he “put his fingers in [her vagina] a little bit.” On one occasion, he penetrated Lisa‟s vagina with his tongue, and on another occasion, he penetrated her anally with what he said was his thumb, but what she believed was his penis. Between 1993 and 1994, these incidents occurred, in total, about fifteen to twenty times.', 'Lisa did not tell her mother about Hazard‟s conduct because she knew that her mother was in love with Hazard and because Hazard threatened to kill himself if she did. She told her best friend about the touching in the fall of 1994, but made her friend promise not to tell anyone because Lisa was afraid. In 1994, Hazard and Carla grew apart,4 and in September 1995, he moved out of their home. Around that time, Hazard lost three family members: his father on March 24, 1995, his sister on January 1, 1996, and his mother on January 21, 1996. He became very depressed, even making funeral arrangements for himself in February 1996, and eventually sought treatment and counseling.', 'On July 7, 1996, Lisa finally revealed to her mother that Hazard had touched her inappropriately.', 'Later that same night, accompanied by a friend, Carla went to Hazard‟s apartment and confronted him. Hazard became visibly nervous and upset, and he started crying and shaking. He apologized and offered to pay for any therapy or counseling for Lisa. Hazard then left his apartment. The next morning, at around 8:35 a.m., a state trooper responded to a 4', 'Hazard and Lisa‟s relationship took a turn for the worse as well. Lisa acknowledged that, at the outset of Hazard‟s relationship with Carla, she displayed some resentment toward Hazard, but she testified that she grew to like him and the two became very close. In 1994, however, Lisa‟s behavior towards Hazard grew defiant, and he, in turn, began to ignore her. Hazard asked Carla to change her work schedule so that she could be home with Lisa during the evenings because he did not want to babysit Lisa anymore.', '-3- call of a man down in the Veterans Memorial Cemetery, where he found Hazard face down and bleeding from slashes on his wrist. The trooper approached Hazard to gather some information about what happened. The trooper also located Hazard‟s vehicle, where he found Hazard‟s identification and a note that said, “I am sorry for all the pain I caused. Please try to forgive me. Town Hall has a copy of my DD214.[5] Hill Funeral Home has paperwork. Thank you.”6', 'B', 'The Trial', 'On October 6, 1997, a jury found Hazard guilty of one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.1, and four counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.3. Hazard filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied on October 23, 1997, and on December 18, 1997, she sentenced Hazard to forty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI)—twenty years to serve, twenty years suspended, with twenty years probation—for the first-degree count, and concurrent thirty- year terms—fifteen years to serve, fifteen years suspended, with fifteen years probation—for the four second-degree counts. Hazard was required to register as a sex offender, and he was ordered to undergo sex-offender counseling, mental-health counseling, and substance-abuse counseling. The trial justice also ordered Hazard to pay restitution to Lisa for costs incurred during her counseling. 5', 'A DD Form 214, or “DD214,” is a “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty” that is issued by the United States Department of Defense upon a military service member‟s retirement, separation, or discharge from active duty. 6', 'The note also included a separate notation addressed to Hazard‟s sister, Grace, that read, “Grace, have them correct the spelling on ma‟s and dad‟s grave stone.”', '-4-', 'C', 'The Direct Appeal and Motion for Sentence Reduction', 'For Hazard‟s direct appeal, he retained new counsel because his trial counsel had passed away. On appeal, Hazard challenged certain evidentiary rulings and the mid-trial excusal of a juror. See Hazard, 785 A.2d at 1115. The appeal was denied on December 3, 2001. Id. at 1123. Hazard then filed a motion for sentence reduction, which also was denied by the trial justice on May 10, 2002. On September 8, 2003, Hazard filed an application for postconviction relief.', 'D', 'Postconviction Relief', 'On May 30, 2006, a hearing was held on Hazard‟s postconviction-relief application. During the hearing, Hazard explained that his trial counsel had requested his authorization to release his mental-health treatment records because trial counsel was concerned for Hazard‟s health and mental wellbeing. He said that his trial counsel never informed him that this material would be provided to the prosecutor. As a result, Hazard maintained, he was shocked and unprepared when confronted with the records for the first time during his trial. Hazard also contested trial counsel‟s strategy to attack Lisa‟s credibility by alleging racial animus. He noted that trial counsel attempted to assign racial bias as the motive behind Lisa‟s accusations, but he himself never thought that Lisa resented him and he said he never agreed to this trial strategy.', 'On January 11, 2010, the postconviction-relief justice, who had also been the trial justice, issued a forty-eight-page decision on Hazard‟s postconviction-relief application. In essence, the postconviction-relief justice distilled Hazard‟s various arguments into two categories. The first involved areas where she found trial counsel‟s performance to be constitutionally deficient, thus meeting the first prong of the Strickland test.7', 'Significantly, however, she found that no 7', 'Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).', '-5- prejudice had inured to Hazard with respect to those deficiencies, in that the outcome of the trial would not have been different if the errors had not occurred; thus, she held that the second prong of the Strickland test had not been met.', 'The second category involved areas where the postconviction-relief justice found that trial counsel‟s performance did not fall beneath an acceptable standard, and, therefore, the arguments failed because the first prong of Strickland was not met.', 'Specifically, the postconviction-relief justice found that trial counsel‟s performance was deficient to a constitutional degree when he produced Hazard‟s psychiatric records to the state,8 when he failed to attempt to limit the use thereof by the state, when he failed to use the records as a defense, and when he failed to properly prepare Hazard for cross-examination. The justice determined, however, that those deficiencies did not deprive Hazard of a fair trial. She further found that trial counsel‟s performance was not deficient in suggesting racial animus to attack Lisa‟s credibility or in failing to object to the prosecutor‟s closing argument, wherein the term “liar” repeatedly was used in reference to Hazard or when the prosecutor used his summation to bolster the credibility of the state‟s witnesses.', 'Ultimately, the postconviction-relief justice denied and dismissed Hazard‟s application.', 'Hazard timely appealed the adverse decision of the postconviction-relief justice to this Court. Before this Court, Hazard contends that his application for postconviction relief should have been granted based on what he alleges were constitutionally deficient and prejudicial errors by his trial counsel. 8', 'The parties did not conduct discovery before trial. Therefore, trial counsel was under no obligation to provide Hazard‟s psychiatric records to the state. There is no question that some of the material in those records was damaging to defendant.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'General Laws 1956 § 10-9.1-1 creates a postconviction remedy that is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant‟s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interests of justice.” Higham v. State, 45 A.3d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 2012) (quoting DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011)). We note that an applicant for postconviction relief must bear “the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [postconviction] relief is warranted” in his or her case. Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 601 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 901 n.7 (R.I. 2008)). When “reviewing the denial of postconviction relief, this Court affords great deference to the hearing justice‟s findings of fact and will not disturb his or her ruling „absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.‟” Higham, 45 A.3d at 1183 (quoting Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 907-08 (R.I. 2011)).', 'When evaluating allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the standard employed by this Court is identical to that set forth by the Supreme Court of the United States in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).', '“Applicants are required to demonstrate that: (1) „counsel‟s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,‟ * * * and (2) „that such deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant‟s right to a fair trial.‟” Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 1284-85 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605-06 (R.I. 2011) and Bustamante v. Wall, 866 A.2d 516, 522 (R.I. 2005)). This Court considers counsel‟s performance in its entirety, and “when that performance is deficient in a number of respects, then the possibility is greater that an accumulation of serious shortcomings', '-7- prejudiced the defendant to a sufficient degree to meet the Strickland requirement.” Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516, 528 (R.I. 2009).', 'When determining whether opinion testimony is inadmissible “bolstering” or “vouching,” this Court considers whether “the opinion testimony has the same substantive import as if it squarely addressed and bolstered another witness‟s credibility * * *.” State v. Rushlow, 32 A.3d 892, 899 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 476 (R.I. 2010)). “When this Court determines that specific testimony constitutes impermissible bolstering, our task is then to determine whether the trial justice‟s decision to admit such improper testimony constituted prejudicial error.” Id. (citing Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Prejudicial Disclosure and Use of Psychiatric Records', 'The postconviction-relief justice found that trial counsel‟s conduct in relation to the disclosure of Hazard‟s psychiatric records fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, thus satisfying the first prong of the Strickland standard, a finding which the state does not contest.', 'Accordingly, we focus on the second prong: whether trial counsel‟s deficient performance was so prejudicial that applicant was deprived of a fair trial. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696.', 'Hazard argues that the postconviction-relief justice erred when she found that the following conduct did not prejudice the outcome of his trial: (1) trial counsel‟s disclosure of his psychiatric records without his specific knowledge or consent, (2) trial counsel‟s failure to object to the use of the records or to limit their use at trial, (3) trial counsel‟s failure to prepare him for the prosecutor‟s cross-examination with regard to the records, and (4) trial counsel‟s failure to', '-8- introduce the records to add weight to his argument that his suicide attempt had nothing to do with the molestation charges. Hazard maintains that he was deprived of a fair trial based on these numerous deficiencies because, through the in-court disclosure of the mental-health records, his credibility was severely damaged while Lisa‟s credibility was corroborated. The state argues that there was an abundance of incriminating evidence presented at Hazard‟s trial to support the jury‟s verdict, and that Hazard was unable to demonstrate that any of trial counsel‟s errors were of such magnitude as to undermine confidence in the jury‟s verdict.', 'Under the second prong of Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696, the applicant bears the burden of proving that prejudice resulted from deficient performance. See Chalk v. State, 949 A.2d 395, 399 (R.I. 2008). To prove prejudice, “[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel‟s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Brown, 964 A.2d at 529 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).', 'In this case, the particular part of the cross-examination on which Hazard focuses is the prosecutor‟s use of one of his psychiatrist‟s progress notes, which referred to an admission by Hazard that he had given Lisa a bath and put lotion on her. The specific use of the psychiatric records on cross-examination of Hazard was as follows:', '“Q', 'Is it fair to say that [Lisa] would put lotion on?', '“A', 'I-- I would not know that in all honesty, sir. I did not go', 'inside of her room.', '“Q', 'Have you ever seen her put lotion on?', '“A', 'No, I did not.', '“Q', 'Have you ever put lotion on her?', '“A', 'No, I did not.', '“Q', 'Are you sure of that?', '“A', 'Yes, sir.', '“* * *', '“Q', 'If I told you that you told [your psychiatrist] on October 22', 'of 1996 that you did put lotion on her, what would you say?', '-9-', '“A', 'If that is what was stated, then that is what was probably', 'stated.', '“Q', 'Did you acknowledge that you stated that then?', '“A', 'I probably did then.', '“Q', 'Do you acknowledge that you stated that to [your', 'psychiatrist]?', '“A', 'I don‟t know-- what date was this--', '“Q', 'October 22 of 1996?', '“A', 'I don‟t recall, but I may have', '“* * *', '“Q', '[After handing the document dated October 22, 1996 to', 'Hazard] May I have that document back? Does that refresh', 'your recollection as to whether you ever put lotion on her?', '“A', 'Yes, it does.', '“Q', 'You acknowledge that you did?', '“A', 'Yes, I do.', '“Q', 'And in the context that you were talking to [your', 'psychiatrist], you stated that you put lotion on her back', 'after-- I am sorry, not on her back-- you put lotion on her', 'after giving her a bath?', '“A', 'I never gave her a bath.', '“Q', 'You acknowledge that is what you told [your psychiatrist]?', '“A', 'I did not tell him that. I am sorry. Never gave that child a', 'bath.” This confrontation forced Hazard to beat a hasty retreat and retract his denial that he rubbed Lisa‟s body with lotion, and it is the effect of this retreat, Hazard argues, that rendered his trial unfair.', 'However, after carefully scrutinizing the record, we agree with the postconviction-relief justice that Hazard has not met his burden of showing with reasonable probability that, but for the alleged errors, the result of his trial would have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In our view, even if the testimony about the lotion was excluded, there is an abundance of “other compelling evidence of his guilt that was more than sufficient for the jury to convict [Hazard] beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brown, 964 A.2d at 541.', 'For example, the postconviction-relief justice observed that, as in Brown, the complaining witness‟s highly persuasive testimony was the heart of the state‟s case. See Brown,', '- 10 - 964 A.2d at 529. She explained that Lisa‟s “testimony was corroborated by the circumstances of its disclosure, the credible testimony of her mother and friend, * * * [Hazard]‟s action upon being confronted with her allegations, [and Hazard]‟s lack of credibility and a credible defense.” Indeed, the postconviction-relief justice noted that trial counsel “did not introduce any contradictory testimony to impeach the credibility of the complaining witness or the other witnesses,” and specifically noted that despite the attempt to proffer evidence of racial animus in an effort to discredit Lisa‟s testimony, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Lisa was not harboring any racial animus toward Hazard at the time she made the allegations based on “the timing of [Hazard]‟s acts of molestation against the young girl and her disclosure of those acts to her mother.” Further, the postconviction-relief justice noted that “the trial justice instructed the jury that if it found [Lisa]‟s testimony to be credible, it could return a guilty verdict on that basis alone.” She concluded that these findings, together, “support[ed] the jury‟s verdict and ma[de] it unlikely that defense counsel‟s alleged errors prejudiced [Hazard] so as to undermine confidence in the outcome of his trial.”', 'In addition to the “strong testimony from [Lisa],” the postconviction-relief justice also found that Carla provided “strong testimony” that “substantiate[d] the jury‟s guilty verdict.” The postconviction-relief justice explained that Carla‟s testimony regarding Hazard‟s reaction to her confrontation of him was credible. Indeed, Hazard did not deny the accusation; he immediately responded, “oh my God, Carla. I am so sorry,” and “it was not when you were working at night, it was when you were in the hospital.” He offered to pay for any counseling that Lisa would need, and he expressed his concern about “how he was going to explain this to [his] sons.” Those statements were corroborated by the testimony of Doug Arling, Carla‟s boyfriend at the time of trial, who had accompanied her to Hazard‟s apartment and who testified convincingly.', '- 11 - Specifically, Arling testified that Hazard never denied the accusations, but rather said that he could not believe what had happened and that he “would rather be dead than alive.” Finally, Carla‟s testimony was further corroborated by the fact that later that same morning after his admission, Hazard attempted suicide, which tended to indicate consciousness of guilt. Indeed, the note that he left in his vehicle provided that he was “sorry for all the pain [he] caused.”', 'Conversely, the postconviction-relief justice found Hazard‟s trial testimony to be patently self-serving. Indeed, she flatly disbelieved Hazard‟s attempts to discredit Lisa‟s story. For example, he claimed that Lisa was never placed in his care, that he did not babysit Lisa, that Carla worked a total of twelve nights during the whole time they were together, that he would go out with Carla on Wednesday through Saturday evenings, and that Lisa‟s grandparents and aunts babysat on both occasions where Carla was hospitalized.', 'However, on cross-examination, Hazard was forced to retract these statements.', 'When pressed about Carla‟s actual work schedule, Hazard acknowledged that Carla regularly worked the evening shift several times per week, presenting numerous opportunities where he was alone with Lisa. Indeed, this was corroborated by Janet Hartman, Carla‟s co-worker from 1993 to 1994, who testified that Carla worked an average of four evening shifts per week during the time period in question. Hazard also changed his testimony during cross-examination about when he went out at night, clarifying that he did not go out regularly with Carla on Saturdays and that it was during only the winter months that he bowled on Thursdays.9', 'In addition, although he remained adamant that he did not babysit Lisa while Carla was hospitalized, Hazard‟s story was contradicted by Lisa‟s grandmother and two of her aunts, who 9', 'During his direct examination, Hazard originally testified that he would go out bowling with Carla on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights, and that he would go to various “night spot[s]” with Carla on Friday and Saturday nights.', '- 12 - testified that Hazard babysat Lisa during Carla‟s two hospitalizations because Lisa needed to be closer to her school.10 Finally, Hazard‟s testimony that he regularly worked overtime was undermined when the state rebutted it with the testimony of Kathy Krzanowski, the postmaster of the East Greenwich Post Office, where Hazard worked during the relevant time. That witness testified that even though Hazard may have worked overtime past the normal end of the day shift at 3:30 p.m., it was “very, very rare” for a postal worker to work until 6:30 or 7 p.m., although Hazard had claimed that he was positive that he worked past 6 p.m.', 'Eventually, Hazard conceded that the amount of time he had actually been alone with Lisa “was up there,” estimating it was “fifty [to] one hundred times.”', 'Finally, the postconviction-relief justice considered the relevance of Hazard‟s suicide attempt. Hazard explained that he tried to kill himself because he was still experiencing grief over the deaths of his sister and his parents, which had occurred months earlier, and from the stress arising from his job. According to Hazard, his failed attempt to end his life had nothing to do with Lisa‟s allegations, and the timing, in his words, merely was coincidental. However, as the postconviction-relief justice concluded, Hazard‟s attempt to resurrect his depression as the explanation for his suicide attempt was unworthy of belief. Indeed, Lisa‟s testimony that Hazard told her he would kill himself if she told anyone further corroborated that his attempted suicide was a result of his consciousness of guilt.', 'After our review of the record and the postconviction-relief justice‟s decision, to which we accord great deference, we agree with her findings that revelation of the psychiatric records relating to the lotion was not enough to prejudice Hazard to the extent of undermining 10', 'Specifically, Barbara, Carla‟s mother, testified that she did not babysit Lisa during the hospitalizations, while Brenda, one of Carla‟s sisters, testified that she cared for Lisa only on the night Carla was in the car accident and Patricia, another sister, explained that Lisa stayed with her “just for a weekend” during the hospitalizations.', '- 13 - confidence in the outcome of the case.', 'Because there was such overwhelming evidence incriminating Hazard, including Hazard‟s own testimony that was riddled with inconsistencies, we agree with the trial justice that the unfortunate errors of counsel, which supported a conclusion of ineffectiveness, did not affect the outcome of the trial. Further, Hazard has not demonstrated how additional preparation for cross-examination would have changed his testimony, such that it would have affected the outcome of the case. Accordingly, because Hazard has failed to meet his burden of proving how his trial counsel‟s failure would have affected the outcome of the case, his claim for relief predicated on the ineffective assistance of counsel must fail.', 'B', 'Deficient Representation', 'Hazard also argues that the postconviction-relief justice erred in concluding that trial counsel was not ineffective to a constitutional dimension when he: (1) attempted to suggest racial animosity towards him to attack Lisa‟s credibility, (2) failed to object to the prosecutor‟s attacks on Hazard‟s character during the prosecutor‟s closing argument, and (3) failed to object to the prosecutor‟s vouching for the credibility of Lisa and her mother during the prosecutor‟s closing argument. We will address each argument in turn.', '1', 'Use of Racial Animosity', 'First, Hazard argues that he did not believe that Lisa harbored any animosity towards him based on his race, and, as a result, he disagreed with his attorney‟s use of this as a tactic. He maintains that the assault on Lisa‟s credibility by alleging racial animosity was so obviously weak that it was objectively unreasonable for his trial counsel to pursue this line of attack.11 The 11', 'Lisa and Carla are caucasian, and Hazard is of color.', '- 14 - state responds that trial counsel‟s strategy of presenting the jury with a motive for Lisa‟s accusations is common in cases that center on credibility, and, therefore, it does not constitute ineffectiveness.', 'It is well settled that judicial scrutiny of counsel‟s performance must be highly deferential. In Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, the Supreme Court of the United States cautioned against “second-guess[ing] counsel‟s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence”; “it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel‟s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.” This Court has also made clear that “mere tactical decisions, though ill-advised, do not by themselves constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.” Bustamante, 866 A.2d at 523 (quoting Toole v. State, 748 A.2d 806, 809 (R.I. 2000)). “A fair assessment of counsel‟s performance, therefore, „requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel‟s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel‟s perspective at the time.‟” Jaiman v. State, 55 A.3d 224, 238 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). “It should also be borne in mind that one who claims ineffective assistance of counsel must overcome the „strong presumption that counsel‟s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance * * *.‟” Lyons v. State, 880 A.2d 839, 842 n.5 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689).', 'Here, the postconviction-relief justice found that trial counsel‟s attack on Lisa‟s credibility was a reasonable tactical decision. She also found that, based on the strength of the evidence against Hazard, there was no prejudice resulting from this decision. We agree. The Sixth Amendment does not guarantee a right to counsel “who would blindly follow [a', '- 15 - defendant‟s] instructions.” Bustamante, 866 A.2d at 524 (quoting State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1029 n.14 (R.I. 2002)). Indeed:', '“A defendant is entitled to counsel capable of rendering competent,', 'meaningful assistance in the preparation and trial of the pending', 'charges, including appropriate evaluation and advice with', 'reference to a plea of guilty. A defendant is not entitled to an', 'attorney who agrees with the defendant‟s personal view of the', 'prevailing law or the equities of the prosecutor‟s case. A defendant', 'is entitled to an attorney who will consider the defendant‟s views', 'and seek to accommodate all reasonable requests with respect to', 'trial preparation and trial tactics. A defendant is entitled to', 'appointment of an attorney with whom he can communicate', 'reasonably, but has no right to an attorney who will docilely do as', 'he is told. Every defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel', 'dedicated to the proposition, and capable of assuring that, the', 'prosecution‟s case shall be presented in conformity with the', 'Constitution, rules of evidence and all other controlling rules and', 'practices. No defendant has a right to more.” Bustamante, 866', 'A.2d at 524 (quoting United States v. Moore, 706 F.2d 538, 540', '(5th Cir. 1983)). Hazard has come forward with no evidence demonstrating that trial counsel‟s tactical decision was objectively unreasonable or so prejudicial to his defense as to amount to a deprivation of his right to a fair trial. Accordingly, we hold that Hazard was not deprived of his right to effective counsel as to this claim.', '2', 'Failure to Object to Credibility Attacks', 'Hazard also argues that the postconviction-relief justice erred in finding that trial counsel‟s failure to object to the state‟s closing argument was not constitutionally deficient. Specifically, Hazard argues that the prosecutor wrongfully referred to him as a “liar” nineteen times during the course of his closing remarks. The state argues, however, that the prosecutor‟s description of Hazard as a “liar” was not an infringement on the jury‟s function, nor was it', '- 16 - otherwise improper, because the prosecutor used the term only after he first highlighted evidence that suggested Hazard was, in fact, lying.', 'While “referring to a witness as „a liar‟ by counsel in his summation” can be “violative of the fair trial concept,” we have held that this rises to the level of an improper credibility attack “when such reference is unrelated to anything in evidence.” State v. Plante, 111 R.I. 386, 390, 302 A.2d 804, 806 (1973). If a prosecutor points to the evidence on which he bases his attack on a defendant‟s veracity, and as long as he does not imply that he was privy to information of which the jury was unaware, the categorization of a defendant as a liar is not impermissible. Id. at 391, 302 A.2d at 807.', 'In this case, the postconviction-relief justice concluded that trial counsel‟s failure to object to the references to Hazard as a liar was not constitutionally deficient performance that was unduly prejudicial to him at trial. She did, however, observe that “[t]his [c]ourt certainly does not condone the prosecutor‟s references in his closing statement to [Hazard] as a liar, as they were impermissible opinion statements of the prosecutor, could imply special knowledge on the part of the State, usurped the jury‟s role in determining credibility and were highlighted through repetition.” To support this, the postconviction-relief justice cited numerous cases, including State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 965-66 (R.I. 2005) and State v. Simpson, 658 A.2d 522, 527-28 (R.I. 1995). We disagree with the postconviction-relief justice on that point, because in those cases, this Court strongly disapproved of the prosecutors‟ use of the terms “monster” and “scum” to describe defendants in their closing arguments. Horton, 871 A.2d at 965-66; Simpson, 658 A.2d at 527-28. Because these tactics “serve[d] to demonize a particular defendant,” we admonished the prosecutors. Horton, 871 A.2d at 965. In our opinion, suggestions that a defendant may have lied during his testimony, if based on the evidence, do not rise to that level.', '- 17 -', 'We stress again that personal attacks on defendants should be avoided. Nonetheless, Hazard has failed to show that the prosecutor‟s references to him as a liar were improper. In this case, the credibility of Hazard‟s testimony was a critical issue to be decided by the jury. Hazard put his own character and credibility at issue by taking the stand, and the prosecutor‟s closing argument that suggested he could be a liar was an attempt to contrast Hazard‟s testimony with other evidence in the case. Before the prosecutor referred to Hazard as a liar, he highlighted several instances where his testimony had been refuted or contradicted, including his testimony (1) that he did not put lotion on Lisa, (2) that his depression was the reason for his suicide attempt, (3) that he did not molest Lisa, (4) that he confronted Carla about Lisa‟s allegations, (5) about his work schedule, (6) about Carla‟s work schedule, and (7) about his schedule for bowling and other recreational activities. Because the prosecutor based his opinion regarding Hazard‟s veracity on the evidence that was presented to the jury, and because he did not suggest that his beliefs stemmed from reasons or knowledge outside the record, it is our opinion that the prosecutor‟s statements in this case were not improper. See State v. Conway, 463 A.2d 1319, 1324 (R.I. 1983). Accordingly, we hold that trial counsel‟s failure to object to these statements was not constitutionally deficient.', 'Moreover, even if the remarks by the prosecutor were improper, we recognize that trial counsel‟s decision not to object may have been made for tactical reasons. Indeed, at times counsel may refrain from raising an objection because it “might only draw the jury‟s attention to damaging facts that it might otherwise minimize, ignore, or overlook.” Toole, 748 A.2d at 810. We afford a high degree of deference when evaluating trial counsel‟s performance.', 'See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. In light of this high degree of deference, we hold that Hazard has', '- 18 - not established that trial counsel‟s “failure to object or his failure to request a cautionary instruction was objectively unreasonable.” See Jaiman, 55 A.3d at 238.', 'Furthermore, even if Hazard had somehow satisfied the first prong of Strickland, we are convinced that he has not demonstrated the existence of any prejudice suffered as a result of the prosecutor‟s characterization of Hazard as a liar. As previously discussed, in addition to failing to show that trial counsel‟s performance was deficient, this Court also must find that trial counsel‟s performance was “so serious as to deprive defendant of a fair trial.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.', 'In this case, we are not satisfied that the prosecutor‟s closing argument was incurably prejudicial or that it would have demanded a declaration of a mistrial. The trial justice carefully instructed the jury about its obligation to review only evidence that had been introduced during the trial. See State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 930 (R.I. 2009) (holding that comments were not prejudicial when the trial justice instructed the jury that it alone was to weigh credibility and that statements by attorneys during closing arguments were not evidence).', 'Specifically, before closing arguments, the trial justice explained that the attorneys “are not * * * allowed to offer their personal opinions as to the evidence and to the extent[] they do so, you must disregard any personal opinions that are stated by counsel.” She also instructed that', '“to the extent that the attorneys make reference to testimony or', 'other evidence that differs from your own recollection as to what', 'the testimony was or the evidence was, I tell you now that it is', 'your recollection that controls and no statement by the attorneys', 'that may differ from your own recollection.” Further, after closing arguments, she again instructed the jury that', '“[i]t is you and you alone who have the responsibility for making', 'credibility determinations and factual determination and of the', 'ultimate determination as to the proper verdict in this case.', '- 19 -', '“Remarks or statements or personal opinions expressed by', 'counsel during the trial or in final argument to you, are not', 'evidence again and are not to be considered by you as evidence', 'during the course of your deliberations.” Based on these clear instructions, the prosecutor‟s comments during closing argument were not unfairly prejudicial. See State v. Fortes, 922 A.2d 143, 151 (R.I. 2007) (“[I]n light of the clear instructions given by the trial justice,” the prosecutor‟s comment during closing argument “was not unfairly prejudicial.”). Accordingly, we hold that trial counsel‟s failure to object did not prejudice Hazard or undermine the validity of the trial or the verdict that was reached.', '3', 'Failure to Object to Vouching', 'Finally, Hazard contends that trial counsel‟s failure to object to what he argues was improper vouching for the truthfulness of Lisa, Carla, and Arling during the state‟s closing argument, and his failure to request a cautionary jury instruction, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'The state concedes that the prosecutor‟s statements arguably were improper vouching, but maintains that the postconviction-relief justice properly concluded that trial counsel‟s failure to object to the prosecutor‟s remarks were not so prejudicial as to meet the second prong of Strickland.', '“We have held that „[a] prosecutor is allowed considerable latitude in [closing] argument[s] * * * as long as [he or she] stays within the evidence and * * * legitimate inferences * * *.‟” Jaiman, 55 A.3d at 236 (quoting State v. Werner, 851 A.2d 1093, 1107 (R.I. 2004)). “However, we also have said that „[i]t is improper for the prosecution to vouch for the credibility of a government witness,‟” which can occur “if the prosecution „place[s] the prestige of the government behind the witness * * *.‟” Id. at 236-37 (quoting State v. Chakouian, 537 A.2d 409, 412 (R.I. 1988)). “It is not enough, however, for a defendant on appeal to assert that the', '- 20 - prosecutor assured the jury that a witness‟s testimony was credible.” Id. at 237. “The defendant must be able to identify, as the basis for that comment, an explicit or implicit reference to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney or information not contained in the record.” Id.', 'It is patently obvious that this case centered on credibility. As a result, both sides liberally attacked the veracity of the witnesses produced by the other. Indeed, during trial counsel‟s closing argument, he attacked the credibility of Lisa, Carla, and Arling: he made comments such as, “if you do believe [Lisa], you have to ignore a lot of facts and a lot of testimony,” he pointed out inconsistencies in Carla‟s testimony, and he suggested that Arling was biased because he was in a relationship with Carla. In response to these attacks, the prosecutor referred to Lisa‟s testimony as “honest and forthright.” He also made comments, such as “[w]hen she testified, did she look like she was telling the truth? I thought she did. I thought she came up very honest. She was very forthright,” and he also suggested that there was no evidence that her mother told her what to say “[b]ecause the young girl is telling the truth.” In reference to Arling‟s credibility, the prosecutor asked the jury “[h]ow credible is that? It is pretty credible.”', 'He also suggested that Carla “[wa]s telling the truth.”', 'Arguably, these comments could be construed as improper vouching and implying special knowledge on the part of the state. See Jaiman, 55 A.3d at 237 (citing examples of improper vouching).', 'Assuming without deciding that the prosecutor‟s statements about Lisa, Carla, and Arling were objectionable, it is nonetheless our opinion that trial counsel‟s failure to object was not constitutionally deficient or so prejudiced Hazard that it rendered the verdict in his trial unreliable. As we discussed above, we “indulge a strong presumption that counsel‟s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance * * *.” Jaiman, 55 A.3d at 238.', '- 21 - In light of that high degree of deference, we hold that Hazard has not established that trial counsel‟s failure to object was “objectively unreasonable.” Id. Moreover, as discussed above, the trial justice instructed the jury that any statements made by counsel during closing arguments were not evidence and that opinions of counsel expressed during trial or in their closing arguments are improper and should be disregarded. Accordingly, we hold that trial counsel‟s failure to object did not prejudice Hazard or undermine the validity of the trial or the verdict that was reached.12', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court. 12', 'Similarly, Hazard challenges the following remark by the prosecutor in his closing argument: “Did [trial counsel] ever confront [Lisa] with an inconsistent statement from all of her prior statements? I got her statements. Did he ever confront her with a prior inconsistent statement? Absolutely not.” While this comment may be improper, Hazard has failed to establish any prejudice as a result of his trial counsel‟s failure to object. As the postconviction-relief justice observed, this remark “was brief and isolated, and came after the jury had already heard an abundance of evidence regarding [Hazard]‟s guilt, including the testimony of several corroborating witnesses,” and, therefore, did not prejudice Hazard or the outcome of his trial.

This case came before the Supreme Court on April 2, 2013, on a petition for certiorari filed by Doris E. Poulin (hereinafter Poulin or defendant), against the State of Rhode Island (state), seeking review of a decision by a judge of the District Court denying her motions to seal records related to two misdemeanor complaints which resulted in dismissals. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the District Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 18, 1996, defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to one felony count of possession of a controlled substance.', 'In exchange for her plea, defendant was placed on probation for two years, required to complete a substance-abuse program, and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. It is undisputed that she complied with all of the conditions of her probation. However, defendant subsequently was charged with the misdemeanor offense of operating a motor vehicle on a suspended license, a charge that was dismissed on July 18, 1996. Many years later, on December 15, 2009, defendant was arrested and charged with driving under', '-1- the influence; that misdemeanor charge was dismissed on February 3, 2010. It is the records of these latter two charges which are the subject of this case.', 'In accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-1-12.1,1 defendant moved in the District Court to have the records related to those two misdemeanor charges sealed and, further, to have the law- enforcement-identification records related to those charges destroyed.2 In denying the motions to seal, the trial judge likened defendant‟s motions to motions for the expungement of a criminal record and concluded that the prior drug offense for which defendant was placed on probation was, for purposes of § 12-1-12.1, a conviction, such that “this [d]efendant would, in fact, be barred from having her two cases expunged, even though they are dismissals.”3 The trial judge explained that it would not be logical for the definition of “conviction” to differ as between the sealing and expungement statutes, which, she determined, were “somewhat intertwined.” The trial judge concluded that our decisions in State v. Briggs, 934 A.2d 811 (R.I. 2007), and State v. Alejo, 723 A.2d 762 (R.I. 1999), stood “for the proposition that a nolo plea, followed by a 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-1-12.1(a) provides:', '“Any person who is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts in a criminal', 'case, including, but not limited to, dismissal or filing of a no true bill or no', 'information, may file a motion for the sealing of his or her court records in the', 'case, provided, that no person who has been convicted of a felony shall have his', 'or her court records sealed pursuant to this section.” 2', 'The first motion to seal was in reference to the complaint including the charge of driving under the influence; the second motion to seal was in reference to the complaint including the dismissed charge for operating with a suspended license. 3', 'Specifically, the trial justice stated:', '“I find that based upon the cases of [Alejo] and Briggs and the other line of cases', 'that hold a nolo plea followed by probation constitute[s] a conviction, this court', 'does find that for purposes of [§]12-1-12.1 a nolo plea followed by probation is a', 'conviction, and this [d]efendant would, in fact, be barred from having her two', 'cases expunged, even though they are dismissals, so [the] motion[s] to seal, with', 'all respect, [are] denied.”', '-2- sentence of probation, is considered a conviction * * * for the purposes of the expungement statute.” Accordingly, the trial justice declared that “a plea of nolo followed by a probationary period would be considered a conviction [for purposes of the sealing statute].” We granted defendant‟s petition for certiorari.', 'The defendant frames the issue before us as “[w]hether a court can refuse to seal a dismissed criminal charge pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-1-12 (2012) when the moving party has not been convicted of a felony as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-18-3 (2012).”4 The defendant then advances several arguments in support of her contentions, some of which we need not address. Primarily, Poulin argues that the plain and unambiguous language of the relevant statutes dictates that she is entitled to have the court files in the dismissed cases sealed and all records reflecting those complaints destroyed. Next, defendant argues that the sealing and expungement statutes are separate and distinct in both purpose and design and that, therefore, the statutes should not be treated similarly. The defendant also asserts that the sealing statutes do not conflict with the recording statute, which imposes a duty of record keeping on the Attorney General.', 'Not surprisingly, the state argues that a plea of nolo contendere to a felony charge followed by probation constitutes a felony conviction that disqualifies a defendant from the benefits of the sealing statute.', 'Specifically, the state contends that the plain wording and statutory structure of chapter 1 of title 12 lead to the conclusion that a plea of nolo contendere 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-18-3(a) provides, in pertinent part:', '“Whenever any person shall be arraigned before the district court or superior', 'court and shall plead nolo contendere, and the court places the person on', 'probation pursuant to § 12-18-1, then upon the completion of the probationary', 'period, and absent a violation of the terms of the probation, the plea and probation', 'shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose.”', '-3- followed by probation constitutes a conviction for the purposes of the sealing statute. Moreover, the state argues that this Court‟s precedent concerning the meaning of a conviction—and the case law involving sealing and expungement of criminal records—supports the state‟s argument.', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of „the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.‟” State v.

Catanzaro, 21 A.3d 253, 259 (R.I. 2011).', 'Discussion', 'We begin our analysis of the principal issue in this case—whether a plea of nolo contendere to a felony charge followed by a successfully completed term of probation constitutes a conviction for the purpose of the sealing statutes—with a discussion of the relevant statutory provisions.', 'The sealing statutes are set forth in §§ 12-1-12 and 12-1-12.1. Section 12-1-12(a), “Destruction or sealing of records of persons acquitted or otherwise exonerated,” provides, in pertinent part:', '“Any fingerprint, photograph, physical measurements, or other', 'record of identification, heretofore or hereafter taken by or under', 'the direction of the attorney general, the superintendent of state', 'police, the member or members of the police department of any', 'city or town or any other officer authorized by this chapter to take', 'them, of a person under arrest, prior to the final conviction of the', 'person for the offense then charged, shall be destroyed by all', 'offices or departments having the custody or possession within', 'sixty (60) days after there has been an acquittal, dismissal, no true', 'bill, no information, or the person has been otherwise exonerated', 'from the offense with which he or she is charged, and the clerk of', 'court where the exoneration has taken place shall, consistent with', '§ 12-1-12.1, place under seal all records of the person in the case,', 'including all records of the division of criminal identification', 'established by § 12-1-4; provided, that the person shall not have', 'been previously convicted of any felony offense * * *.”', 'Section 12-1-12.1, “Motion for sealing of records of persons acquitted or otherwise exonerated,” provides a statutory mechanism to ensure that the provisions of § 12-1-12 are complied with by the appropriate agency, on motion by the affected person. Section 12-1- 12.1(a) provides:', '-5-', '“Any person who is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts', 'in a criminal case, including, but not limited to, dismissal or filing', 'of a no true bill or no information, may file a motion for the', 'sealing of his or her court records in the case, provided, that no', 'person who has been convicted of a felony shall have his or her', 'court records sealed pursuant to this section.” We are mindful that the practical concepts of sealing and expunging5 records frequently are conflated and that references to sealing and expungement sometimes are employed interchangeably.', 'At a fundamental level, the sealing and expungement statutes relate to the destruction or elimination from public view of certain records of criminal arrests and/or convictions; however, the provisions diverge from that common premise in important ways. There are very different procedural mechanisms in these statutes: §§ 12-1-12 and 12-1-12.1 permit the sealing of records related to charges against a person “after there has been an acquittal, dismissal, no true bill, no information, or [if] the person has been otherwise exonerated,” § 12-1-12; the expungement provisions, G.L. 1956 §§ 12-1.3-1 through 12-1.3-3, are limited to first offenders and allow for the “sealing and retention of all records of a conviction and/or probation and the removal from active files of all records and information relating to conviction and/or probation.” Section 12- 1.3-1(2). The difference between the two statutory schemes is evident. A motion to seal properly is made with respect to an acquittal and in cases that have been dismissed in circumstances amounting to an exoneration, while a motion for expungement relates to a 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-1.3-2(a), “Motion for expungement,” reads:', '“Any person who is a first offender may file a motion for the expungement of all', 'records and records of conviction for a felony or misdemeanor by filing a motion', 'in the court in which the conviction took place, provided that no person who has', 'been convicted of a crime of violence shall have his or her records and records of', 'conviction expunged.”', '-6- criminal disposition—including a case in which probation or a deferred sentence has been imposed—and is available only to first offenders. See Briggs, 934 A.2d at 818. Significantly, in enacting the sealing statute, § 12-1-12, the General Assembly elected to exclude persons with prior felony convictions from its purview.6 It is this classification between persons previously convicted of a felony offense and all others that we are called upon to address.', 'Although the state seeks to extend the reasoning applied in expungement cases to motions to seal records in cases amounting to an exoneration of the accused, we decline to do so. By enacting separate and distinct statutory provisions, the Legislature plainly elected to treat these cases differently. Accordingly, we shall examine them separately.', 'Section 12-18-3 is a statutory limitation on the effects of a plea of nolo contendere followed by probation. Section 12-18-3(a) clearly and unambiguously mandates that, when a person enters a plea of nolo contendere to a felony charge and receives a sentence of probation, “the plea and probation shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose.” (Emphasis added.) We deem this provision controlling. Here, defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere, and successfully complied with the conditions of her probationary sentence. Accordingly, this plea does not constitute a conviction for “any purpose” that is unrelated to the original disposition. In attempting to deprive defendant of the benefits of the sealing statute, the state is seeking to use a plea of nolo contendere followed by probation as a bar to the sealing of defendant‟s records in a different case; that is, for some other purpose—to prevent the sealing of records in a dismissed misdemeanor case. The statute forbids this. Indeed, § 12-18-3(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[e]vidence of a plea of nolo contendere followed by a period of probation, completed without 6', 'We pause to note that the state did not articulate a governmental purpose that is furthered by a classification that distinguishes between persons with prior felony convictions and those with no prior convictions.', '-7- violation of the terms of the probation, may not be introduced in any court proceeding * * *.”7', 'Further, nothing in §§ 12-1-12 (“Destruction or sealing of records of persons acquitted or otherwise exonerated”) or 12-1-12.1 (“Motion for sealing of records of persons acquitted or otherwise exonerated”) directs that a plea of nolo contendere followed by probation should be deemed a conviction under those statutory provisions. The state argues that we should follow the reasoning we outlined in Briggs that “characterized a nolo contendere plea followed by probation as a conviction for purposes of expungement.” Briggs, 934 A.2d at 817 (citing State v. Alejo, 723 A.2d 762 (R.I. 1999); State v. Gobern, 423 A.2d 1177 (R.I. 1981)). However, our holding in Briggs is distinguishable from the case at bar in several respects. First, in this case, we are confronted with a different criminal charge—two dismissed misdemeanor complaints that are wholly unrelated to the felony charge. Additionally, we made clear in Briggs, 934 A.2d at 816 n.11, that we were considering only the expungement statute, and not the sealing statute. Indeed, the convictions that were the subject in Briggs were not eligible for sealing, id. at 816 & n.11, and, further, the appellants in Briggs received deferred sentences, not probation.8 Id. at 813. Therefore, Briggs is neither controlling nor instructive on the issue of what constitutes a “conviction” in the context of the sealing statutes. Indeed, it makes sense that a plea of nolo contendere followed by probation would not preclude a defendant from sealing his or her records. In the sealing context, the affected person has been acquitted or exonerated, whereas a person seeking to have his or her records expunged has not. Therefore, sealing should be more 7', 'We note, though, that a plea of nolo contendere “may be furnished to a sentencing court following the conviction of an individual for a crime committed subsequent to the successful completion of probation on the prior offense.” Section 12-18-3(a). 8', 'In State v. Briggs, 934 A.2d 811, 817 (R.I. 2007), “[w]e [held] that deferred sentences should be treated like probationary dispositions in the expungement context.” In the context of sealing, however, we have not so held. Accordingly, we decline to equate the facts of this case—a nolo plea followed by probation—to those presented in Briggs—nolo pleas followed by deferred sentences.', '-8- widely available to those individuals than to those seeking to have their records expunged.', 'We conclude that, for purposes of the sealing statute, § 12-1-12.1(a), defendant has not been convicted of a felony, that she meets all the statutory requirements of the sealing statutes, and that she is entitled to the benefits provided in those enactments. Accordingly, it was error to deny defendant‟s motion to seal all records pertaining to her two dismissed misdemeanor arrests.', 'We also are satisfied that our holding is not inconsistent with the state‟s statutory duty to keep and maintain records of convictions in accordance with § 12-1-7 of the General Laws.9 That enactment has no relevance to arrest records and certainly bears no relationship to cases in which the arrestee has been exonerated.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we quash the judgment of the District Court and return the papers in this case with our decision endorsed thereon. 9', 'Section 12-1-7, “Criminal identification records--Stolen property reports,” provides:', '“It shall be the duty of the attorney general to procure and file for record', 'in the office of his or her department so far as the same can be procured,', 'fingerprints, plates, photos, outline pictures, descriptions, information, and', 'measurements of all persons who shall be or shall have been convicted of [a]', 'felony, or imprisoned for violating any of the military, naval, or criminal laws of', 'the United States or of any state, and of all well-known and habitual criminals', 'from wherever procurable.

The defendant, Jose Rivera, appeals from the denial of a motion to reduce a sentence in accordance with Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure; he argues that the sentence he received upon conviction on multiple counts of first- and second-degree sexual assault and one count of simple assault against three developmentally disabled women is without justification and disproportionate to sentences imposed for similar crimes. After carefully considering the written submissions and arguments of counsel, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time.

We therefore recount only those facts necessary to our disposition of this appeal.', 'At the time of these offenses, defendant was employed as a bus driver in the RIde division of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. In that capacity, he drove five bus routes to the Adeline LaPlante Memorial Center (LaPlante Center), an organization providing services to individuals with developmental disabilities. The defendant‟s duties were to pick up the assigned passengers, transport them to the LaPlante Center, and assist them in boarding and disembarking from the bus.', 'In June and July of 2005, defendant sexually assaulted two of his female passengers and physically assaulted a third. The first victim, a thirty-seven-year-old LaPlante Center employee with a severe developmental disability, was assaulted on two occasions. Each time, defendant touched the victim‟s breasts and placed his penis on her vagina, all without her consent. The defendant also engaged in unconsented sexual contact with the breasts and vagina of his second victim, a twenty-two-year-old developmentally disabled woman. Finally, defendant touched the upper body of a third victim, a thirty-nine-year-old developmentally disabled woman, without her consent.', 'The defendant was indicted on two counts of first-degree sexual assault and two counts of second-degree sexual assault of the first victim, two counts of second-degree sexual assault of the second victim, and one count of second-degree sexual assault of the third victim. The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts pertaining to the first two victims, and it found defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple assault of the third victim. The trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment on the first-degree sexual assault counts and concurrent', '-2- terms of fifteen years to serve on the second-degree sexual assault counts involving the first victim. With respect to the second-degree sexual assault crimes against the second victim, the trial justice imposed two concurrent sentences of fifteen years, to run consecutively to the sentences imposed for the counts involving the first victim. Finally, the trial justice sentenced defendant to one year for the simple-assault conviction, consecutive to all other sentences. The cumulative result of defendant‟s sentences was life imprisonment, followed by a consecutive term of sixteen years to serve.', 'This Court affirmed defendant‟s conviction on February 12, 2010. On May 5, 2010, defendant timely filed a motion to reduce his sentence. At a hearing before the same trial justice on June 27, 2011, defendant argued that the sentence was disproportionate to the putative relevant sentencing benchmark—benchmark 35D of the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks—for first-degree child molestation of a mentally or physically disabled child, which recommends a sentence between twenty and thirty years to serve.1 The defendant also cited State v. Gardiner, 895 A.2d 703, 704-06 (R.I. 2006), a case involving the first-degree sexual assault of a developmentally disabled woman at a group home at the hands of a community- living aide where the defendant was sentenced to twenty years with eight to serve, and argued that the sentence imposed here was disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases. Finally, in an attempt to show that defendant‟s sentence was excessive when compared to the sentences typically meted out by the trial justice, defendant introduced an exhibit containing a list of first-degree and second-degree child molestation and first-degree sexual assault cases, 1', 'Defense counsel selected the sentencing benchmark for first-degree child molestation because the first victim‟s developmental disability rendered her the functional age of a five- or six-year- old child.', '-3- along with brief summaries of those cases, over which the trial justice had presided. Defense counsel recommended that defendant‟s sentence be reduced to twenty to thirty years to serve.', 'During the hearing, the trial justice inquired whether defendant wished to address the court. After being informed that defendant declined to do so, the trial justice noted that one of the factors impacting the sentence defendant received was his failure to express remorse or take responsibility for his actions, and the trial justice asked whether there had been any change in these circumstances. Defense counsel related that there had been a discussion between defendant and officials at the Adult Correctional Institutions concerning enrollment in sex-offender counseling but that, because defendant was housed in Maximum Security, he was prevented from participating in that treatment program.', 'For its part, the state highlighted the severity of the offenses, juxtaposed with the position of trust that defendant held with respect to his duty towards these individuals. The state argued that defendant‟s crimes were “unprecedented” and stressed that defendant never had accepted responsibility for his actions. Accordingly, the state argued against a sentence reduction.', 'The trial justice denied defendant‟s motion. The trial justice explained:', '“[T]he fact that each of the victims in this case was', 'developmentally disabled was the driving force behind the', 'sentence imposed. Although the chronological age of each of the', 'victims was that of an adult, the functional age was that of a', 'child[,] and children as well as developmentally-disabled adults are', 'similar in that they are both vulnerable * * *.” The trial justice further explained that he had “never been presented with a similar set of facts, either as to what happened or as to the type of victims involved” and that “the nature of the crimes was horrific,” “the victims, being all developmentally-disabled adults, * * * were obviously [the] most vulnerable,” and defendant, “who took advantage of his position of authority and trust as their, not only [their] driver, but really responsible adult while they were on', '-4- that bus, raped [the first victim] and sexually assaulted [the second victim] and assaulted [the third victim].”', 'Finally, the trial justice remarked that defendant still had not accepted responsibility for his actions, nor had he expressed remorse. For these reasons, the trial justice determined that the requested relief was unwarranted. The defendant appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35(a) “is „essentially a plea for leniency‟ * * * addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, who may grant it if he or she decides „on reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.‟” State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1253 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R.I. 2008)); see also State v. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 101 (R.I. 2011); State v. Byrnes, 456 A.2d 742, 744 (R.I. 1983).', 'In line with our “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice‟s discretion in sentencing matters,” our review of a trial justice‟s ruling on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited; we will interfere with the trial justice‟s decision only in those “rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Snell, 11 A.3d at 101 (quoting State v. Ruffner, 5 A.3d 864, 867 (R.I. 2010)); see also State v. Dyer, 14 A.3d 227, 227 (R.I. 2011) (mem.). The defendant bears the burden to convince us that his or her sentence violates this standard. State v. Diefenderfer, 32 A.3d 931, 935 (R.I. 2011); Snell, 11 A.3d at 101.', 'Analysis', 'In an effort to surmount the high hurdle that is a challenge to a denial of a motion to reduce a sentence, defendant assigns four errors to the trial justice‟s decision. First, defendant contends that his sentence is grossly disparate from the sentence called for by the relevant', '-5- sentencing benchmark—benchmark 35D—which recommends a sentence between twenty and thirty years to serve. Second, defendant argues that his sentence is grossly disparate from the sentences imposed in similar cases generally and in similar cases over which the trial justice presided in particular.', 'Third, defendant claims that the trial justice failed to give full consideration to the evidence defendant put forth to mitigate the severity of his sentence, including his long stint as a law-abiding citizen and the letters in support of defendant, which portrayed him as a “thoughtful, caring, hard-working gentleman who has always positively impacted the lives of others.” Finally, defendant asserts that the trial justice unfairly construed his failure to participate in sex-offender counseling—which, defendant maintains, was made impossible by the length of his sentence—as evidence of a failure to accept responsibility for his crimes. We address each contention in turn.', 'With respect to defendant‟s benchmarks argument, although both parties agree that benchmark 35D, the benchmark for first-degree child molestation of mentally or physically disabled children, bears some relevance to this case because the victims had severe developmental disabilities that rendered them the functional age of small children, there is no consensus on whether other sentencing benchmarks also apply. The state argues that benchmark 31C, which recommends a sentence of more than twenty years to serve for one or more convictions of first-degree sexual assault involving aggravating circumstances, and benchmark 35E, which suggests a twenty-five-years-to-life sentence for conviction of first-degree child molestation where there are multiple counts of conviction, physical injury, or aggravating', '-6- circumstances, are instructive. The defendant demurs, arguing that “aggravating circumstances,” as that term is defined in the benchmarks, are not present in this case.2', 'We need not enter this fray.', 'We repeatedly have explained that “the [sentencing] benchmarks are not mandatory and * * * are only „a guide to proportionality.‟ * * * A trial justice is „bound only by the statutory limits.‟” Snell, 11 A.3d at 102 (quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A.2d 650, 655 (R.I. 2009)); see also State v. Morris, 863 A.2d 1284, 1289 (R.I. 2004). The sentence imposed on each count of conviction in this case was within the statutory range. See G.L. 1956 § 11-37-3 (“Every person who shall commit sexual assault in the first degree shall be imprisoned for a period not less than ten (10) years and may be imprisoned for life.”); § 11-37-5 (“Every person who shall commit sexual assault in the second degree shall be imprisoned for not less than three (3) years and not more than fifteen (15) years.”); G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 (“[E]very person who shall make an assault or battery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.”).', 'Moreover, the benchmarks themselves recognize that “substantial and compelling circumstances” can justify departure from the recommended sentence. The benchmarks identify several factors that could, in any given case, militate in favor of a departure; these enumerated factors include: “harm to the victim”; “circumstances of the commission of the crime”; “whether the crime was an isolated offense or part of an organized enterprise”; “defendant‟s attitude and feeling about the crime (i.e., remorse, repentance, hostility)”; and “other substantial grounds 2', 'Benchmark 31C of the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks provides the following definition of “aggravating circumstances”: “Aggravating circumstances include, but are not limited to, excessive force or violence; the act having been committed in conjunction with other crimes; moderate to severe injury, mental or physical; or perpetration of acts which are particularly degrading or humiliating to the victim.”', '-7- which tend to mitigate or aggravate the offender‟s culpability.” See Snell, 11 A.3d at 102 (listing some of these factors, along with others).', 'In this case, the trial justice, while noting that he had reviewed the benchmarks, identified several factors that, in his mind, justified a lengthy sentence. He explained that “the fact that each of the victims in this case was developmentally disabled was the driving force behind the sentence imposed.”', 'The trial justice found the harm to the victims to be extensive and continuing; he noted that he received letters from the mothers of the victims and one from defendant‟s first victim that indicated that “they continue to live in fear and have to deal with the rapes and sexual assaults that occurred every day.” The trial justice further noted that defendant had been entrusted with the care of each of the victims and that defendant had broken this trust. He found that “the nature of the crimes was horrific” and that the victims “were obviously [the] most vulnerable.”', 'He explained that this case did not involve a single, isolated incident; defendant‟s crimes “were separate, distinct and discrete offenses that occurred at separate times and separate places under different conditions or circumstances.” Finally, the trial justice was struck by defendant‟s persistent failure to accept responsibility or express remorse: “in this case[,] the defendant has not and continues not to accept responsibility, * * * nor has the defendant expressed one iota of remorse * * *.” In sum, the trial justice believed that the sentence imposed “reflect[ed] the nature of the crimes, [and] the impact on the victims.”', 'Thus, even if we were to assume that benchmark 35D was the only applicable benchmark, the trial justice identified a plethora of factors justifying a departure from that benchmark.', 'We cannot say that the sentence imposed by the trial justice was without justification and was also grossly disparate from other sentences as to amount to an abuse of discretion.', '-8-', 'We similarly are satisfied that defendant‟s argument that his sentence is grossly disparate from sentences imposed in similar cases is unpersuasive. First, with respect to the sentences imposed by the trial justice in similar cases, the trial justice found that this case was sui generis, explaining that “in [his] tenure as a judge, * * * [he had] never been presented with a similar set of facts, either as to what happened or as to the type of victims involved.” After a careful review of the cases relied upon by defendant for this comparison, we have no reason to doubt the trial justice‟s assessment.', 'The defendant also alleges that his sentence is grossly disparate from sentences generally imposed in similar cases; in doing so, defendant principally relies on two opinions from this Court—State v. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d 950, 951 (R.I. 2011), and Gardiner, 895 A.2d at 704-06. In Gardiner, 895 A.2d at 705-06, the defendant, a community-living aide at a group home, anally raped a developmentally disabled adult woman with an IQ of approximately fifty-five. Although our opinion affirming the defendant‟s conviction is silent as to the sentence imposed, defendant maintains, and the state does not contest, that the defendant in Gardiner received a twenty-year sentence, with eight years to serve, the balance suspended, with probation. The underlying facts in Barkmeyer are no less disturbing; in that case, the defendant bound the hands and feet of his eight-year-old stepdaughter and digitally penetrated her vagina, causing injuries so severe that the victim required surgery. State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 989-91 (R.I. 2008). The defendant received a fifty-year sentence, with thirty years to serve, the balance suspended, with probation. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 951. In this case, defendant argues that his sentence is disproportionate to the sentences meted out in Barkmeyer and Gardiner given the similarities of the crimes.', '-9-', 'However, this case involves not a single aberration, but a series of sexual assaults upon multiple victims, all of whom were developmentally disabled. These circumstances were not present in either Barkmeyer or Gardiner, each of which involved the commission of a single instance of sexual assault, albeit very serious, upon one victim. The multiple-offense and multiple-victim aspects of this case, coupled with the other circumstances relied upon by the trial justice—including the nature of the offenses, the impact on the highly vulnerable developmentally disabled victims, and defendant‟s steadfast refusal to accept responsibility or express remorse—convinces us that the sentence imposed should not be disturbed.', 'Cf. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 953 (“[T]he trial justice properly focused on the severity of [the] defendant‟s crime, which he referred to as a „truly * * * horrific, unforgivable criminal act‟ and „as vile an act as [he could] envision,‟ ultimately warranting the „harsh‟ sentence imposed. We discern no error in this determination.”); State v. Sifuentes, 667 A.2d 791, 792 (R.I. 1995) (affirming the denial of a motion to reduce a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a first-degree murder involving torture and aggravated battery because “it [was] clear that the trial justice was mindful of the barbaric, gruesome nature of the crime and was equally mindful that the defendant had failed to accept responsibility and to express remorse for that crime”).', 'Moreover, although defendant‟s life sentence is the maximum sentence authorized by § 11-37-3, we note that this case hardly is the first in which a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed for first-degree sexual assault. See, e.g., State v. Cook, 45 A.3d 1272, 1274-75 (R.I. 2012); State v. Vieira, 913 A.2d 1015, 1015-16 (R.I. 2007); State v. Thomas, 723 A.2d 788, 789 (R.I. 1998) (mem.); State v. Kholi, 706 A.2d 1326, 1326 (R.I. 1998) (mem.); State v. McVeigh, 683 A.2d 375, 375, 376 (R.I. 1996) (mem.) (affirming the trial justice‟s denial of a', '- 10 - motion to reduce a sentence that amounted to “the equivalent of two [consecutive] life sentences,” which the trial justice recognized as “possibly the most severe sentence ever imposed for sexual assault”); State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965, 968 (R.I. 1994); State v. Acquisto, 619 A.2d 428, 428 (R.I. 1993); State v. Shatney, 572 A.2d 872, 874 (R.I. 1990); State v. Ferrara, 571 A.2d 16, 17 (R.I. 1990); State v. Griffin, 567 A.2d 796, 798 (R.I. 1989).', 'We therefore reject defendant‟s argument that his sentence is grossly disparate from sentences imposed in similar cases.', 'We next turn to defendant‟s contention that “his good character and otherwise unblemished history for the first fifty-plus years of his life” should have mitigated the severity of his sentence. Although the trial justice acknowledged that he considered the letters submitted on defendant‟s behalf, it is abundantly clear from his bench decision that he found this mitigation evidence to be outweighed by countervailing circumstances, including the nature of the offenses, the fact that the victims were developmentally disabled, the impact of the crimes on the victims, and defendant‟s failure to accept responsibility or express remorse. Employing our deferential standard of review, we decline to hold that the trial justice struck an inappropriate balance.', 'Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice unfairly considered his inability to engage in sex-offender counseling, a consequence of the length of his sentence, as further evidence of a failure to accept responsibility. After carefully reviewing the trial justice‟s bench decision, however, we do not agree that he equated nonparticipation in sex-offender counseling with failure to accept responsibility. At most, the trial justice rejected defendant‟s argument that, because he had sought sex-offender counseling, albeit unsuccessfully, he has evidenced a desire to accept responsibility; the trial justice explained that defendant‟s efforts in that regard “carrie[d] no weight.” The conclusion that defendant‟s post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts', '- 11 - would not carry any weight in ruling on the motion to reduce is supported by our precedent. See Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 953 (“This Court repeatedly has held that it is within a trial justice‟s discretion to reserve consideration of a defendant‟s „good behavior and rehabilitative efforts while in prison to the parole board.‟ * * * Consequently, a trial justice is not required to consider or lend „credit‟ to a defendant‟s prison behavior when making a Rule 35 determination.” quoting Ruffner, 5 A.3d at 866, 868). We discern no unfairness in the trial justice‟s refusal to credit defendant‟s efforts to enroll in sex-offender counseling.', 'Although we recognize that the defendant‟s sentence undeniably is lengthy, the offenses of which the defendant stands convicted irrefutably were horrific. The trial justice identified several factors supporting the statutorily-authorized life sentence for first-degree sexual assault. The defendant has not convinced us “that this matter is among those rarest of cases that would justify altering our strong policy against interference with the ruling of the trial justice.” Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 955 (quoting Dyer, 14 A.3d at 228). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not stray from the confines of his discretion in imposing this sentence and denying the defendant‟s motion to reduce.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

This case is before the Court on the defendant‘s appeal from a judgment of conviction on one count of child enticement in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-26-1.5, which appeal has been consolidated with this Court‘s grant of the defendant‘s petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of his having been adjudicated in contempt as a result of certain in-court conduct. On appeal, the defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in denying his first motion for a new trial—which motion, according to the defendant, contended that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction on the count of child enticement; (2) that the trial justice erred in denying his second motion for a new trial, which was', '-1- based on a claim of newly discovered evidence; and (3) that the trial justice erred in adjudicating him in contempt of court.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction as well as the adjudication of contempt.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 30, 2008, the Attorney General charged defendant by way of a criminal information with one count of second degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-4 and 11-37-5 (count 1) and one count of attempting to persuade a minor child ―to enter a vehicle with intent to engage in lewd, illicit or criminal conduct‖ in violation of § 11-26-1.5 (count 2).1 The charges stemmed from an incident that occurred in North Kingstown on September 3, 2008.', 'The defendant‘s trial commenced on June 10, 2009, and the state presented the testimony of six witnesses: (1) James Leeds, a passenger in defendant‘s vehicle at the time of the 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-26-1.5, as amended by P.L. 2008, ch. 203, § 1 (which is entitled ―Enticement of children‖) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―(a) A person shall be guilty of a felony if that person attempts to', 'persuade, or persuades a minor child under the age of sixteen (16)', 'years, whether by words or actions or both, with intent to engage in', 'felonious conduct against that child to either:', '(1) Leave the child‘s home or school;', '(2) Enter a vehicle or building; or', '(3) Enter an area, with the intent that the child shall be', 'concealed from public view; while the person is acting without the', 'authority of: (i) the custodial parent of the child, (ii) the state of', 'Rhode Island or a political subdivision of the state, or (iii) one', 'having legal custody of the minor child.

We summarize below the pertinent evidence presented at trial.', 'A', 'The Evidence at Trial', '1', 'The Testimony of James Leeds3', 'James Leeds testified that he spent between two and two-and-a-half months in Rhode Island during the early Fall of 2008. He further testified that he knew defendant because they worked together. Mr. Leeds stated that defendant transported him to and from work, and he also stated that they ―hung out somewhat after hours.‖', 'Mr. Leeds testified that, on September 3, 2008, he and defendant were together after work when, at some point, ―probably between seven and eight p.m.,‖ he and defendant and another person whom Mr. Leeds referred to as ―Wade‖4 went for a ride in defendant‘s green van. Mr. Leeds further explained that he was in the passenger seat and defendant was driving the vehicle, while Mr. Bardin was seated behind them. He stated that the van pulled into a parking area of an apartment complex so that Mr. Bardin could carry out an errand. 2', 'We shall refer to the complaining witness and the other minor witnesses by pseudonymous first names in an effort to protect their privacy. 3', 'Mr. Leeds was called as a witness out of order so as to accommodate his logistical needs. 4', 'We infer from the record that the man whom Mr. Leeds identified as ―Wade‖ is James Wade Bardin, another witness at defendant‘s trial. For the sake of clarity, we shall refer to ―Wade‖ as Mr. Bardin.', '-3-', 'It was Mr. Leeds‘s testimony that, once Mr. Bardin returned, the van moved to what was referred to as ―the roadway area,‖ at which point defendant ―stuck his head out the window‖ to speak to a person whom Mr. Leeds referred to in his testimony as a ―young lady.‖ He stated that the young lady was ―carrying things from her vehicle to the inside of her apartment.‖ Mr. Leeds further testified that defendant ―asked the young lady if she had an old man.‖ Mr. Leeds stated that the young lady replied ―no‖ to defendant, who then ―put the van in park and got out of the van and walked over to her.‖ Mr. Leeds further testified that defendant put his arm around the young lady for what he estimated to be forty-five seconds to a minute.', 'Mr. Leeds qualified his testimony by explaining that he had not been ―watching every move‖ and by also explaining that he had been discussing ―work-related issues‖ with Mr. Bardin. In response to a question from the prosecutor, Mr. Leeds testified that, although he was not watching the entire time, he did not see defendant grab the breast of the complaining witness or pull her towards the van. He stated that he heard defendant tell her that he was from Louisiana and that he had an ATM card and that he would ―be back.‖ Mr. Leeds testified that, following these exchanges, he was able to get defendant‘s attention by rolling down a window in the van and saying that they ―need[ed] to go,‖ at which point the three men left the parking lot.', '2', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'The complaining witness, Suzanne, testified that she was sixteen years old at the time of trial and had been fifteen years old at the time of the incident at issue. Suzanne testified that, on September 3, 2008, at around 8 p.m., she went to her mother‘s van in order to bring some laundry into their apartment.', '-4-', 'Suzanne testified as to her recollection that a green minivan bearing a Maine license plate drove past her and that the driver spoke to her. When the prosecutor asked her to describe what the driver said to her, Suzanne replied that the driver had said in a loud voice: ―Hey, baby.‖ She added, however, that she was not sure whether that salutation was directed towards her and her two friends.', 'Suzanne further testified that, after the driver had uttered those words, ―he just drove by and then he came back‖; she added that he proceeded to ―[get] out of the driver‘s seat.‖ When asked if she recalled hearing anyone say anything from inside the van, she replied that, before the driver stepped out of the van, ―the passenger guy told him not to get out of the car.‖ The prosecutor asked Suzanne if the driver said anything else to her, and she replied that he asked her whether she had ―a daddy or a boyfriend.‖', 'When asked by the prosecutor what the driver did after he exited the van, Suzanne responded that he walked directly to her, not to the two friends who were with her (Dawn and Diane). Suzanne testified that the driver did not say anything else at that point; she added, however, that he put his right arm around her and grabbed her right breast. She stated that he was whispering that he was from New Orleans and that he had an ATM card which he could give to her; she testified that, as he was saying those things, he was ―touching‖ or ―grabbing‖ her breast and that he ―moved it around.‖ She explained that she did not say anything to him because she was ―scared of what was going to happen next‖; however, later in the trial, she acknowledged that, when defendant approached her and spoke to her, she told him that she had a boyfriend and that he was ―in the house.‖ Suzanne testified that the next thing she recalled happening was the driver pulling her towards the van; she added that the top half of her body moved, although her legs ―stayed.‖', '-5-', 'Suzanne testified that, when she first tried to free herself from the driver‘s grasp, he pulled her more towards the van. She also testified that she ―shook [her] body away from him‖ in an attempt to remove his arm. She further testified that, after he let go, he said ―okay, okay‖ and went back to the van. She explained that she was within feet of the van and that only the driver‘s side door (which was facing her) was open. Suzanne added that, as the driver was returning to the van, he said that he was going to come back with his ATM card. She stated that her friends then told her to go inside to tell her mother and to call the police.', 'Suzanne further explained that ten minutes elapsed between the first time she heard defendant say something to her and the moment he departed in the van. She acknowledged that defendant had been touching her breast for three minutes. She additionally testified that she and her two friends were ―together‖ during the entirety of defendant‘s interaction with her. Suzanne also described how, later in the evening of September 3, 2008, she identified defendant to the police. Suzanne also made an in-court identification of defendant as being the ―person that did this to [her].‖', 'The prosecutor also introduced into evidence the audio recording of the 9-1-1 call that the complaining witness and her mother made with respect to the September 3, 2008 incident as well as a transcript of what was said during that call. During the call, Suzanne was asked whether ―they grabb[ed] any of you.‖ Suzanne responded: ―No, they, he tried to grab me, but I was like, sir, you need to, like back up and get in your car right now * * *.‖', 'When the prosecutor questioned Suzanne about what she meant when she said ―tried to,‖ she admitted that she had been ―lying to the police officer‖; she indicated that her reason for ―lying‖ was that she had not wanted to call the police or tell anyone about the incident because she was embarrassed. Under cross-examination by defense counsel, Suzanne agreed that she', '-6- would sometimes lie in order to avoid being embarrassed. She further admitted that she had lied in the past (including to the police and the 9-1-1 operator) in order to avoid embarrassment. She also agreed that the reason the police were called was because ―some guy tried to pick [her] up.‖ When asked, Suzanne admitted that she never mentioned to the police that the man actually grabbed her or pulled her towards the van. She also admitted that neither did she tell her mother any of those details. Suzanne elaborated that she and her friends Dawn and Diane were speaking all at once to her mother when they told her about what had transpired.', '3', 'The Testimony of Dawn', 'Dawn testified that she was twelve years old at the time of the trial and that she lived near the apartment complex where the September 3, 2008 incident occurred. Dawn stated that, around 7 p.m. on that day, she was helping Suzanne bring in some laundry. She recalled seeing a green van ―go around the circle.‖ Dawn testified that it was her recollection that there were three men in the van and that the man in the driver‘s seat exited the vehicle. She described the driver as ―pretty tall‖ and also as ―really tall,‖ and she recalled that he was ―pretty muscular.‖ She admitted that, although she ―[got] a good look at him,‖ she did not see his face.', 'Dawn stated that she remembered the driver of the van ―grabbing‖ Suzanne. Dawn further testified that she remembered him asking Suzanne if she had a boyfriend. She testified that she saw him put his arm around Suzanne‘s neck and that he then ―grabbed her right boob‖ with his hand. She admitted that she was not looking at him the whole time, but she recalled that Suzanne stepped back and said, ―Yo‖ and then said: ―You need to, sir, you need to get back in your van.‖ Dawn also testified that she heard the passenger tell the man three or four times to get back into the van; she added that the driver replied ―shut up‖ to the passenger. She estimated', '-7- that the driver was outside the van for about ten minutes. She testified that the driver then returned to the van and ―peeled out.‖ Dawn agreed with defense counsel‘s estimate on cross- examination that the ―whole incident took about 60 seconds.‖', 'Dawn also testified that Suzanne and Diane appeared ―pretty scared,‖ but that no one yelled or screamed. And, when asked on cross-examination whether the driver of the vehicle tried to grab Suzanne, or tried to pull or push her into the van, Dawn responded ―no‖ to each question. She also admitted that, when she gave her statement to the police, she never told them that she could not see the face of the man who she said had touched Suzanne.', '4', 'The Testimony of Diane', 'Diane testified that she was ten years old at the time of the trial and that Suzanne was more Dawn‘s friend than hers, but that she still ―h[u]ng out with her.‖', 'She testified that, on the day that she was helping Suzanne, they were bringing in laundry at ―dusk,‖ after dinner. Diane testified that she remembered a green minivan pulling up and a man getting out and talking to Suzanne. She further testified that he said to Suzanne: ―You‘re a hot momma * * *. Who‘s your daddy[?] I can be your boyfriend.‖ She stated that, as the man was saying these things to Suzanne, she saw him put his right arm around Suzanne and touch ―her left boob.‖ She added that she was sure that neither of the other two persons exited the van. Diane testified that she also remembered the man saying that he had an ATM card and that he ―would‖ or ―could buy us anything we wanted.‖ She stated that the man asked Suzanne where she (Diane) lived and that he was going to ―come back and get [them] later.‖ She explained that she was ―scared and upset‖; she said that she thought that the man was trying to kidnap them. Diane also testified that the man put his arm around Suzanne and tried to pull her into the van, at', '-8- which point Suzanne ―backed up.‖ In the course of her in-court testimony, Diane identified defendant as the man whose actions she had been describing.', 'On cross-examination by defense counsel, Diane testified that Suzanne had asked the man to return to the van. She also stated that the entire episode had lasted for approximately sixty seconds. Further on cross-examination, she acknowledged that she had never informed the investigating police officer that she saw defendant touch Suzanne‘s breast; she stated that the first time that she ever mentioned such an occurrence to anyone was during her testimony at a pretrial suppression hearing. She further agreed that the first time she ever told anyone that he tried to ―grab [Suzanne] into the car‖ was during her testimony at trial.', '5', 'The Testimony of James Bardin', 'James Bardin testified that he knew defendant and James Leeds because the three of them worked together. He testified that, on September 3, 2008, he entered the back seat of a green minivan and joined defendant, who was driving the minivan, and Mr. Leeds, who was sitting in the passenger seat. Mr. Bardin testified that they drove to an apartment complex, where he carried out an errand and then returned to the vehicle. He testified that, as they were backing out of the parking lot of the apartment complex, ―there was a young lady by a van with three or four kids that [were] running around right there with her.‖ Mr. Bardin further testified that defendant stopped the van beside the young lady and ―hollered * * * through the window asking her if she had a boyfriend.‖ Mr. Bardin stated that he told defendant that the ―girl [did not] look quite old enough to even be talking to.‖', 'Mr. Bardin also testified that, while defendant was still in the van, defendant asked the young lady if she had a boyfriend or needed help; he added that defendant mentioned something', '-9- about having an ATM card and being able to take care of her. Mr. Bardin testified that, at that point, defendant exited the van and that defendant and the young lady proceeded to speak with each other for a few minutes. Mr. Bardin testified that he told defendant to get back into the van. He then testified that ―it came up she had a boyfriend in the house‖ and that defendant returned to the van. Mr. Bardin added that defendant continued to speak to the young lady, repeating that he could take care of her. Mr. Bardin stated that defendant said she was a ―good looking girl‖ and ―that he would like to get to know her.‖ Mr. Bardin testified that he was fairly sure that the windows of the van were down; he added that he was watching defendant the whole time. Mr. Bardin also testified that he ―[n]ever‖ saw defendant ―go up to the girl.‖', '6', 'The Testimony of Officer Eli Mulligan', 'Officer Mulligan testified that, as of the time of trial, he had been employed by the North Kingstown Police Department for approximately eight years. He testified that, on September 3, 2008, he was patrolling the northern end of the town when he received a dispatch advising him ―that a green minivan with Maine plates was involved in an attempted abduction of a female juvenile.‖ It was his recollection that he arrived on scene at approximately 8:20 p.m. and that he spoke separately with Suzanne, Dawn, and Diane.', 'Officer Mulligan further testified that, at some point, he learned that the green minivan had been located and that a suspect was being detained. He testified that he transported the three girls to the location of the green minivan and that each of them identified the green minivan as the one that they had seen at Suzanne‘s apartment complex. Officer Mulligan also testified that Suzanne and Diane identified defendant as the man who had been the driver of the van.

The defendant emphasized that the jury instructions themselves, in addressing the enticement count, required that the prosecution prove that defendant had the intent to commit second degree sexual assault. The state countered that the jury‘s acquittal of defendant on the second degree sexual assault count did not preclude the guilty finding on the child enticement count. The state further argued that, for the purpose of the trial justice‘s review of the trial testimony, there was sufficient evidence of enticement so as to preclude the grant of the motion for a new trial.', 'At the conclusion of a hearing on the first motion for a new trial, the trial justice summarized from the bench the evidence presented at trial. He found that the evidence presented by Dawn and Diane was largely credible and corroborated Suzanne‘s testimony. He stated: ―So, in sum, the evidence is ample * * * to support the jury verdict on [the child enticement count]. I see no inconsistency in the evidence.‖ He further stated that ―I accept the jury‘s verdict in [the child enticement count], and I happen to agree with it. I would come to the same conclusion.‖ Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant‘s first motion for a new trial.', '- 12 -', 'D', 'Defendant’s Second Motion for a New Trial', 'Subsequently, on September 11, 2009, defendant, citing Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, moved for a new trial based upon what he contended was newly discovered evidence; he also contended that his right to due process had been violated. The defendant asserted that the complaining witness‘s medical records might indicate that she had been in counseling and was currently being treated; he argued that those records reasonably could be expected to contain statements made relative to her claims against him or otherwise exculpatory evidence. The trial justice granted defendant‘s motion for a subpoena duces tecum with respect to the medical records, which he said should be turned over to the court for in camera review. After the records had been reviewed by the trial justice and by counsel, the parties appeared before the trial justice on October 15, 2009 for a hearing on the second motion for a new trial.', 'In his second motion for a new trial, defendant argued that the medical records contained information that went to the credibility of the complaining witness, which records he said constituted newly discovered evidence that could not have been obtained before trial. The prosecutor objected, arguing that none of the records that were produced pursuant to the subpoena duces tecum would have been admissible at trial and that the result of the trial would not have been different had defense counsel been able to use the information contained within the records to impeach the complaining witness.', 'The trial justice explained that he too had reviewed the records and determined that the state had not been under an obligation to inquire of the complaining witness regarding the', '- 13 - psychological counseling that she had received.6', 'He additionally found that none of the information contained within the records, even if admissible, would have produced a different outcome. The trial justice further noted that the jury had carefully weighed the testimony of the complaining witness, which weighing he said was ―apparent from the verdict‖; the trial justice specifically noted that the jurors had ―rejected a portion of her testimony.‖ As to the guilty finding on count 2 (the enticement charge), the trial justice stated that the evidence of enticement that was testified to by the complaining witness was corroborated by the other witnesses— including the complaining witness‘s two friends and at least one of the passengers in defendant‘s van.

Although this Court has ―never held that the waiving of the right to appeal a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal acts as a waiver of a right to appeal the denial of a motion for a new trial when it is based upon a claim of insufficient evidence,‖ State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988), an argument seeking a new trial based upon insufficient evidence must still be made in the trial court for it to be preserved. See State v.

Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 570–71 (R.I. 2011). The defendant did, in fact, move for a new trial; however, it is clear from the record that that motion was not predicated on the insufficiency of the evidence, but rather challenged witness credibility and the weight of the evidence. See State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008) (noting that ―the moving party at the trial court level must articulate the motion in an understandable manner for the trial justice‖). As we have stated, we ―will not fault a trial justice for failing to rule upon a question that was not presented to him [or her] in a rational and recognizable posture.‖ Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, defendant‘s written motion for a new trial was premised on the weight of the evidence criterion, and his argument dealt in large part with the alleged lack of credibility of various witnesses. No reference was made in that written motion to the standard of review that', '- 18 - applies when a new trial motion concerns the insufficiency of the evidence, and the oral argument before the trial justice did not address the latter type of new trial motion.', 'Additionally, at the hearing on the motion, defendant argued again that the lack of ―credible‖ evidence led to impermissible inferences.', 'At that hearing, defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial justice all addressed the first motion for a new trial solely in terms of the weight of the evidence standard. It is clear that the question presented to the trial justice was whether the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, not whether the evidence itself was insufficient to sustain the verdict. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 829. We conclude that defendant has waived the opportunity to argue the insufficiency of the evidence before this Court; accordingly, we affirm the trial justice‘s denial of defendant‘s first motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'The Motion for a New Trial Based Upon Newly Discovered Evidence', 'The defendant also challenges the denial of his second motion for a new trial, which was based upon what he asserts was newly discovered evidence—namely, certain mental health records relating to the complaining witness. The state counters that the evidence would not have changed the verdict at trial and that, therefore, the trial justice correctly denied the second motion for a new trial.', 'When a trial justice is called upon to consider a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, the analytical approach to be employed differs from that which is employed with respect to a motion based upon the insufficiency of the evidence. See State v. Woods, 936 A.2d 195, 197 (R.I. 2007). The proper analytical approach is two-pronged in nature: ―The first prong encompasses a four-part inquiry, requiring that the evidence is (1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely', '- 19 - cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon which it is admissible, (4) of the type which would probably change the verdict at trial.‖ Id.

See Hazard, 797 A.2d at 464. In his decision denying defendant‘s motion, the trial justice indicated that he had reviewed all of the records and found nothing exculpatory or contradictory in those records. See Woods, 936 A.2d at 197. The trial justice additionally found nothing that would have ―likely produced a different outcome,‖ and he questioned the admissibility of any of the evidence. Defense counsel also repeatedly emphasized the impact on the credibility of the complaining witness and how the documents themselves could not be admitted but rather would go towards impeachment of the witness. Thus, there is no indication that the records would have been admissible, that they would have been anything other than cumulative or impeaching, or that they would have changed the outcome of the trial.

The state first asserts that defendant has waived this argument because he failed to object to the finding of contempt either at the time of the contempt adjudication or later at the time of sentencing; the state also argues that the contempt finding was appropriate.', 'We first address the state‘s contention that defendant has waived the right to challenge the adjudication of contempt. Certainly defendant never objected to the contempt adjudication; he argues, however, that he was precluded from the opportunity to preserve his right to such a challenge due to the trial justice‘s failure to certify the factual basis for the contempt finding. See Rule 42(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 10 Although defendant contends that the trial justice‘s failure to certify the basis for contempt constitutes error, the record contains no hint of an objection in the trial court to either the alleged procedural infirmities or the substantive adjudication of contempt. Without such an objection, those issues are not properly before us, and we conclude that defendant has waived his right to challenge the adjudication of contempt.', 'We would nonetheless comment that, even if the contempt issue were properly before us, we would not be inclined to reverse the trial justice‘s ruling. It is our strong policy to ―firmly and steadfastly uphold the right of a trial justice to impose summary punishment in [certain] circumstances.‖ See Nestel v. Moran, 513 A.2d 27, 30 (R.I. 1986).

53,State : v. : Gary Santos.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Gary Santos appeals from a judgment of conviction for carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a).1 Santos‟ principal argument on appeal is that the trial justice erred when he denied his motion to suppress tangible evidence, to wit, a .44-caliber revolver and eleven bullets. Santos argues that his motion to suppress should have been granted because the revolver and bullets were seized after a police officer conducted what he alleges was an illegal search in violation of article 1, sections 6 and 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Santos also argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal, which he alleges was based on insufficient evidence. This case came before this Court, sitting at Exeter West Greenwich High School, on April 4, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties‟ written and oral submissions, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-8(a) provides, in pertinent part, that “[n]o person shall, without a license or permit * * * carry a pistol or revolver in any vehicle or conveyance or on or about his or her person whether visible or concealed * * *.”', '-1- this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 24, 2010, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Officer Bethany Dolock of the South Kingstown Police Department was on patrol. While she was driving northbound on Route 1 in South Kingstown, the police officer saw a vehicle that was traveling about twenty miles per hour over the speed limit. She activated her overhead lights and the driver pulled over. Officer Dolock pulled up behind the car, exited her marked cruiser, and walked toward the car. As she did, she noticed that there was a garment bag hanging from the rear ceiling on the driver‟s side that was blocking her view of the back seat. When she approached the driver‟s side and was first able to look into the vehicle, she saw several loose bullets in an ashtray to the left-hand side of the steering wheel. She promptly asked the driver if he had a weapon; he responded that he did not. During this exchange, Officer Dolock detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from the vehicle, and she observed that the driver was looking around the car and intentionally looking away from her. She described this as unusual behavior for a motorist during a traffic stop.', 'Officer Dolock testified that she repeated her question, asking the driver again if he had a weapon, and the driver again responded that he did not. The driver then turned his body towards the passenger side of the vehicle, and Officer Dolock could no longer see his hands. Fearing for her own safety, she partially withdrew her service weapon from its holster and directed the driver, who was later identified as Santos, to “put his hands where [she] could see them.” Santos complied and then got out of the vehicle at the officer‟s direction. As he got out of the car, Officer Dolock could smell a strong odor of alcohol coming from Santos‟ breath, and she noticed that he had bloodshot, watery eyes and a slight sway in his stance. Officer Dolock, who was', '-2- alone with Santos during this time, then guided him to the rear of his car and initiated a cursory pat-down of his outer clothing for a weapon. That cursory examination revealed a small pocket knife in one of his pockets. She asked Santos if he had any more weapons, and he denied that there were any.2 Officer Dolock testified that she placed Santos in handcuffs and explicitly informed him that he was not under arrest, but that she was handcuffing him “for [her] safety and his.” At that time, Trooper Marc Lidsky of the Rhode Island State Police passed by the scene as he was on his way home; as was his usual practice, he stopped to render assistance.', 'Officer Dolock tried to inquire of Santos further, but he was uncooperative, responding to her questions by saying that “he would only speak to the trooper because he was in charge.” After Santos refused to answer any questions, Officer Dolock led him to her cruiser, at which time two South Kingstown officers arrived as backup.3 As soon as she secured Santos in the rear of her cruiser, Officer Dolock searched Santos‟ vehicle for weapons while Trooper Lidsky monitored traffic and kept an eye on Santos. The first area of the car that she searched was the front passenger‟s side of the vehicle—the area where she had lost sight of Santos‟ hands. She observed several more loose bullets and what appeared to her to be the butt of a gun. When she tilted the passenger‟s seat forward, she discovered a loaded revolver on the floor.', 'Officer Dolock returned to her cruiser and asked Santos if he had any documentation as to who owned the revolver. Santos did not respond. She then escorted him out of her cruiser with the intention of administering the standard field sobriety tests. After he refused to submit to the tests, she arrested him for suspicion of driving under the influence of intoxicants. She then 2', 'Office Dolock testified at trial that Santos denied that he had a weapon when she asked him, but her police report indicates that he “appeared hesitant in his answer as he looked in his vehicle.” 3', 'Officer Dolock had called for backup from the South Kingstown Police Department on a radio on her lapel when she first observed the bullets in the ashtray. Trooper Lidsky arrived on the scene before additional South Kingstown officers arrived.', '-3- placed him back in her cruiser and transported him to the South Kingstown police station for processing.4', 'As a result of this traffic stop, Santos was charged with carrying a weapon while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs in violation of § 11-47-52 (count 1), carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license in violation of § 11-47-8(a) (count 2), and unlawfully operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2(d)(1) (count 3).', 'Before his trial began, Santos filed a motion to suppress the revolver and the bullets, arguing that they were the fruits of an illegal search. On November 16, 2010, the trial justice heard arguments on the motion, which the trial justice denied the next day. Thereafter, a two- day jury trial commenced. At the close of the state‟s case, Santos moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, based on Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, and he renewed his motion to suppress.5 The trial justice granted the Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal as to count 1 and count 3, but he denied the motion as to count 2.', 'The trial justice also denied the renewed motion to suppress. In a written decision denying the renewed motion to suppress, the trial justice first concluded that the search of the vehicle could not be justified by the “search incident to arrest” doctrine under Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 343 (2009), which instructs that an officer may “search a vehicle incident to a 4', 'Officer Andrew Scott Hopewood of the South Kingstown Police Department testified that he brought a camera to the scene, secured the weapon, and transported the revolver and ammunition back to the police station. 5', 'Rule 29(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part:', '“[t]he court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion shall', 'order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses', 'charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, after the', 'evidence on either side is closed, if the evidence is insufficient to', 'sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.”', '-4- recent occupant‟s arrest only when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search.” The trial justice reasoned that Santos was “placed in handcuffs, secured in the back seat of a patrol car, and at least one back-up officer had arrived at the scene to assist” and “[t]herefore, [Santos] was neither free nor mobile and was not within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle.” However, the trial justice then reasoned that “there was sufficient probable cause to search the vehicle for hidden weapons, given the time of night, the discovery of bullets in plain view, the furtive movement by [Santos], and his purposeful failure to look directly at Officer Dolock.” The trial justice also concluded that, “assuming arguendo that Officer Dolock did not have probable cause to search [Santos‟] vehicle, the revolver which was seized [wa]s admissible because it would have been inevitably discovered during an inventory search.”', 'On November 18, 2010, a jury entered a verdict of guilty on count 2. On January 21, 2011, Santos was sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment, with one year to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. Santos timely filed a notice of appeal, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In assessing a decision denying a motion to suppress, “[t]his Court accords deference to a trial justice‟s findings of fact * * * and refrains from overturning such findings unless they are clearly erroneous.” State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 311 (R.I. 2011). However, “[w]hen reviewing an alleged violation of a defendant‟s constitutional rights, this Court „must make an independent examination of the record to determine if [the defendant‟s] rights have been violated.‟” Id. (quoting State v. Abdullah, 730 A.2d 1074, 1076 (R.I. 1999)). In undertaking this independent examination, “we view the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the state.” Id.', '-5- We also “review a trial justice‟s determination of the existence or nonexistence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion on a de novo basis.” Id. (quoting Abdullah, 730 A.2d at 1076).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Constitutionality of the Search', 'Santos argues that the search of his vehicle was unconstitutional because the circumstances that were known to Officer Dolock at the time of the traffic stop were insufficient to support either a finding of reasonable suspicion to support a warrantless search under the protective-search doctrine, or a finding of probable cause to support a warrantless search under the “automobile exception.” Santos also contends that the trial justice erred in concluding that the revolver would have been inevitably discovered during an inventory search, because there was no evidence in the record regarding the South Kingstown Police Department‟s procedure as it related to an inventory search of seized or impounded vehicles. Finally, in response to the state‟s argument, Santos maintains that the trial justice was correct in finding that the search incident to arrest doctrine did not apply because he was secured in the police cruiser and in handcuffs at the time of Officer Dolock‟s search. Conversely, the state urges us to uphold the challenged police conduct as a lawful protective search for weapons; the state does not support the rationale of the trial justice, which was based on a finding of probable cause. In the alternative, the state maintains that the revolver would have been inevitably discovered as the result of a search incident to arrest.', 'Indeed, it is well settled that this Court can affirm a decision on different grounds from those relied upon by the trial justice. See State v. Quaweay, 799 A.2d 1016, 1018 (R.I. 2002). In this case, the trial justice‟s analysis concluded that based on the automobile exception, a', '-6- protective search was warranted. However, the automobile exception and the protective-search doctrine are two separate exceptions that support warrantless searches.', 'The automobile exception allows police officers to search automobiles and containers therein without a warrant when they have probable cause to believe that they hold contraband or evidence of a crime, while the protective-search doctrine allows for a limited search of an automobile without a warrant when he or she has a reasonable belief that the suspect is dangerous and may gain immediate control of weapons. See State v. Milette, 727 A.2d 1236, 1239-40 (R.I. 1999) (discussing the protective-search doctrine); State v. Werner, 615 A.2d 1010, 1013 (R.I. 1992) (discussing the automobile exception).', 'Here, the trial justice provided a sound analysis for a protective search, delineating the specific and articulable facts to support an objective belief that a firearm could be found in Santos‟ vehicle.', 'However, he erred in stating that these facts had to rise to the level of establishing probable cause, when the protective-search doctrine only requires reasonable belief. He also referred to the automobile exception as the theory pursuant to which he was analyzing this case, when he actually applied an analysis for a protective search. Because we have the authority to affirm on grounds other than those relied on by a trial justice, and because a protective search is permitted under a standard that is less rigorous than probable cause, we proceed to consider whether Officer Dolock‟s search was a constitutionally permissive protective search.', 'In evaluating the constitutionality of a search, it is well established that the totality of the circumstances must be taken into account. State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1051 (R.I. 2004) (enumerating factors to support a finding of reasonable suspicion, including location, time, suspicious conduct, unusual appearance of suspect, and personal knowledge and experience of', '-7- the officer). We have held that a police officer may order the driver of a lawfully stopped motor vehicle to get out of his vehicle for the purposes of verifying identification and, if circumstances warrant, conducting a brief pat-down of the suspect. State v. Aubin, 622 A.2d 444, 445 (R.I. 1993); State v. Collodo, 661 A.2d 62, 64-65 (R.I. 1995) (ordering occupants of a lawfully stopped vehicle out of car and patting down outer garments to determine if occupants are armed is constitutionally permissible). Additionally, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, an officer may conduct a limited search of an automobile for weapons when the police officer “has an articulable suspicion to believe that the suspect may be armed and dangerous” and that the suspect has the “present ability to obtain a weapon.” Milette, 727 A.2d at 1239, 1240; see Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983) (expanding protective searches to motor vehicles when “the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on „specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant‟ the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons” (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968))). As we have stated previously, “the very great risk police officers encounter during routine traffic stops,” coupled with “society‟s great interest in ensuring the safety of [the] police during such procedures,” clearly justifies a search of the passenger compartment, albeit limited to those areas where a weapon may be hidden. State v. Tavarez, 572 A.2d 276, 278 (R.I. 1990); see also Long, 463 U.S. at 1048.', 'The circumstances in this case, including Officer Dolock‟s observation of loose bullets— combined with Santos‟ furtive movements, intentional avoidance of eye contact, and positioning of his hands in such a way that the officer could not see them—as well as the fact that it was approximately 8:30 p.m., Officer Dolock was alone, and Officer Dolock discovered a knife during a cursory pat-down of Santos even though Santos told her that he did not have any', '-8- weapons, taken together, convince us that Officer Dolock was reasonable in her belief that Santos might be armed and dangerous. See, e.g., Milette, 727 A.2d at 1240 (protective search of vehicle was constitutional when occupants were gesturing towards floor and handed license and registration before police requested it); Tavarez, 572 A.2d at 278 (furtive movement in response to an approaching police officer heightens apprehension of officer with regard to the action of the motorist and may give rise to reasonable suspicion that the suspect secreted something or gathered something); State v. Garcia Garcia, 821 P.2d 191, 192-93 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1991) (collecting cases holding that the presence of a bullet or bullets could reasonably indicate the presence of a gun, justifying a search of the passenger compartment to ensure the officer‟s safety under Long). Accordingly, based on our review of the record, it is our firm opinion that Officer Dolock possessed specific and articulable facts that justified her decision to pat Santos down for weapons, as well as to conduct a limited sweep of Santos‟ vehicle for weapons. See Collodo, 661 A.2d at 65 (no constitutional rights violated by asking the defendant to leave the vehicle or by conducting a pat-down when there were specific and articulable facts warranting such action).', 'Santos argues that, even if there was a reasonable belief that he was armed and dangerous, there could be no reasonable belief that he had a present ability to obtain a weapon because he was handcuffed and secured in Officer Dolock‟s cruiser. However, in Long, the United States Supreme Court recognized that “investigative detentions involving suspects in vehicles are especially fraught with danger to police officers”: a suspect could break away from the officer and retrieve a weapon in the vehicle or may be permitted to re-enter the vehicle before the investigation is over and gain access to a weapon. Long, 463 U.S. at 1047, 1051-52; see Terry, 392 U.S. at 24, 30 (explaining that “where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be', '-9- afoot,” the officer may briefly stop the suspicious person and make “reasonable inquiries” aimed at confirming or dispelling his suspicions, and if there is a reasonable belief that the individual the officer is investigating is “armed and presently dangerous,” the officer may conduct a pat- down search to determine whether the suspect is in fact carrying a weapon).', 'Certainly the underlying policy of protecting police officers that animates the Long decision applies equally here. The record reveals that Officer Dolock‟s investigation regarding Santos‟ possible intoxication was not complete when she placed him in the cruiser. Indeed, she testified that she informed him that he was not under arrest at that time. After Officer Dolock conducted her search of the vehicle and secured the revolver, she removed Santos from the cruiser so that she could continue her investigation of his potential intoxication by administering field sobriety tests.', 'Had Officer Dolock continued her investigation without checking the interior of his vehicle for weapons, the potential existed that Santos could break away from her control and gain access to the revolver secreted in his vehicle. See Long, 463 U.S. at 1051-52 (search of passenger compartment for weapons authorized, because Terry suspect may break away from police control and retrieve weapon from automobile); Milette, 727 A.2d at 1239. In addition to the danger that Santos might break away before the conclusion of the field sobriety tests, there was also a possibility that Santos would return to his vehicle and secure the revolver if Officer Dolock elected to release him after administering the tests to him. See Long, 463 U.S. at 1051-52 (when a police officer compels the exit of an individual from a vehicle in order to conduct a Terry frisk, the officer remains vulnerable to the possibility that the individual, if not arrested, will be free to retrieve any weapons within his car); Milette, 727 A.2d at 1239. Accordingly, we hold that the search of Santos‟ vehicle was constitutional as a protective search for weapons.', '- 10 -', 'In the alternative, Santos argues that when he was handcuffed and placed in the back of Officer Dolock‟s cruiser, the investigatory stop was transformed into a de facto arrest, which required probable cause. However, “[s]tanding alone, „the use of handcuffs does not necessarily turn an encounter into an arrest for which probable cause is required.‟” State v. Apalakis, 797 A.2d 440, 445-46 (R.I. 2002) (quoting United States v. Fountain, 2 F.3d 656, 666 (6th Cir. 1993)). Even though the standard for distinguishing between an investigative detention and an arrest is not always clear because both constitute seizures, see State v. Bennett, 430 A.2d 424, 427 (R.I. 1981) (explaining that a police officer has “seized” a person when he restrains that person‟s freedom to walk away), whether a detention is an investigative detention or an actual arrest depends on the reasonableness of the intrusion under all of the facts. See Apalakis, 797 A.2d at 446. During an investigative detention, an officer may employ the force reasonably necessary to effect the goal of the detention, which could include investigation, maintenance of the status quo, and officer safety. See United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 11 (1989); Terry, 392 U.S. at 18-19 (investigative detention must be reasonably related in scope both in terms of the force used and the duration); see Apalakis, 797 A.2d at 446. If the force employed exceeds what is reasonably necessary to effect the goal of the stop, such force may transform an investigative detention into a full-blown arrest. See Apalakis, 797 A.2d at 446.', 'In this case, we are of the opinion that Santos was neither under arrest when he was placed in the police cruiser, nor was his detention a ruse to justify a search of his car. The preliminary factors giving rise to Officer Dolock‟s suspicion that Santos was intoxicated—a strong odor of alcohol, a sway while standing, and bloodshot, watery eyes—led her to believe that further investigation was warranted.', 'However, as Officer Dolock testified, she was concerned with her safety given the circumstances, which included that it was 8:30 p.m., she was', '- 11 - alone, Santos exhibited suspicious behavior, including furtive movement and avoidance of eye contact, Officer Dolock observed bullets, and Officer Dolock discovered a knife during a cursory pat-down of Santos, thus revealing that he was not truthful in response to her initial questioning about whether he had any weapons. In order to safely continue her investigation, Officer Dolock secured Santos to the extent that was reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Further, her detention of Santos was only long enough for her to conduct the search of Santos‟ vehicle. See Apalakis, 797 A.2d at 446. Accordingly, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, Santos was subjected to an investigative detention, not an arrest, at the time Officer Dolock searched his vehicle.', 'Finally, Santos argues that Officer Dolock had probable cause to arrest him for driving under the influence at the time she conducted her search, and the fact that she conducted a Terry search instead of placing him under arrest suggests improper manipulation of the circumstances by Officer Dolock in an attempt to justify the search. Santos insists that a finding by this Court that her search was permissible would promote a perverse incentive for police officers to delay an arrest in order to conduct a search of the passenger compartment that would otherwise be disallowed by Gant, 556 U.S. at 351.6 However, based on the totality of the circumstances, the record certainly suggests that Officer Dolock acted reasonably, and did not deliberately wait to arrest Santos, thereby manufacturing an artifice by which she could conduct a search of his vehicle. It is clear to us, as Officer Dolock herself testified, that her main concern was her own 6', 'In Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 351 (2009), the United States Supreme Court held:', '“Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant‟s', 'arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the', 'passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable', 'to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.', 'When these justifications are absent, a search of an arrestee‟s', 'vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or', 'show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies.”', '- 12 - protection while she investigated her suspicion that Santos was intoxicated. As discussed above, Officer Dolock‟s objectively reasonable safety concerns justified her protective search of the area near the passenger seat.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the search of the vehicle was constitutionally valid, and we affirm the decision of the trial justice denying Santos‟ motion to suppress.7', 'B', 'Acquittal', 'Turning to Santos‟ second argument—that the trial justice should have dismissed the charge under § 11-47-8(a) because there was on insufficient evidence that Santos owned the vehicle and the revolver—we are satisfied that ample evidence was introduced to persuade a fact finder that Santos knowingly possessed the revolver and intentionally exercised control over it.', 'Under Rule 29, “[t]he court * * * shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction * * *.” In this case, Santos was convicted under § 11-47-8(a), and the state had “the burden of proving „every element necessary to constitute the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.‟” State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Hazard, 745 A.2d 748, 751 (R.I. 2000)). Thus, the state was required “to establish that [Santos] possessed * * * a revolver and that he did not have a license or permit as required by law.” State v. Huy, 960 A.2d 550, 555 (R.I. 2008). An essential element to convict under § 11-47-8(a) is conscious carrying: there must be proof that the defendant had “[k]nowing or conscious contact with an item” to constitute possession. State v. Benevides, 425 A.2d 77, 80 (R.I. 1981). Further, we have recognized that possession can be constructive, which requires the state to “prove that a defendant had knowledge of the presence 7', 'Given our disposition that the search was reasonable under Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), we do not express any opinion on the parties‟ arguments concerning inevitable discovery pursuant to an inventory search, search incident to arrest, or the automobile exception.', '- 13 - of the contraband and the intent to exercise control over the weapon.” State v. Arenas, 800 A.2d 432, 434 (R.I. 2002) (mem.). Knowledge of the contraband and intent to exercise control “can be inferred from a totality of the circumstances,” State v. Santiago, 799 A.2d 285, 287 (R.I. 2002) (quoting In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d 685, 689 (R.I. 1999)), and typically that knowledge and intent are established by circumstantial evidence and logical inferences. See, e.g., State v. Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 71 (R.I. 1994); State v. Mercado, 635 A.2d 260, 263-64 (R.I. 1993).', 'Viewing the evidence “in the light most favorable to the state” and “giving full credibility to the state‟s witnesses,” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 148 (R.I. 2010)), we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Santos “inten[ded] control of the designated object with knowledge of its nature.” Benevides, 425 A.2d at 79; see also § 11-47-8(a). In this case, the revolver was found within reaching distance of Santos and in a vehicle he was operating. Further, Santos had actually moved toward the area where the revolver was ultimately discovered.', 'Because we recognize that “knowledge of the existence and location of the contraband can be inferred from [the] defendant‟s conduct in reaching toward the area where the contraband was located,” and that “knowing possession also can be presumed when the contraband is found in the vehicle defendant is operating,” we hold that there was sufficient evidence to uphold Santos‟ conviction under § 11-47-8(a).', 'Santiago, 799 A.2d at 288.

The wheels of justice have moved at a glacial pace in this litigation, which stems from a dispute over monies allegedly owed to a now-defunct corporation for work performed as part of a construction project that took place in 1990. The plaintiff, Piccoli & Sons, Inc. (Piccoli), instituted suit about twenty-two years ago. Roughly seventeen years later, a justice of the Superior Court dismissed the action, finding that Piccoli could neither maintain the action in its own name nor substitute another entity as plaintiff. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on April 2, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel 1', 'On February 19, 1991, Piccoli filed a complaint against E & C Construction Company, Inc. (E & C) and its president, Laura Donatelli, alleging that E & C owed it $395,272.72 for construction work it had performed at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) in Cranston. Piccoli asserted that, in 1990, it had contracted with E & C to perform excavation and general site work for an expansion of the intake center at the ACI. E & C was a subcontractor of Perini Corporation (Perini), the project’s general contractor. Piccoli sought damages under several causes of action, including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent misrepresentation.', 'In an answer filed on April 12, 1991, defendants denied liability and raised several affirmative defenses. E & C asserted that Piccoli had executed a release of all claims against it and attached a copy of that release to its answer. E & C also lodged a third-party complaint against Perini, who it claimed had released E & C from any and all liability to Piccoli for work performed on the project.', 'On July 18, 1991, Piccoli amended its complaint, adding Perini and the State of Rhode Island (the state) as defendants.', 'Piccoli’s counsel averred that, after he filed the original complaint, he learned that Perini had not posted a bond for the project, as required by G.L. 1956 § 37-12-1. Piccoli’s amended complaint contained several new counts against both Perini and the state based upon Perini’s alleged failure to post a bond.', 'Several months later, on October 16, 1991, Piccoli was petitioned into receivership. Attorney Allan M. Shine was appointed as receiver. Thereafter, on April 28, 1992, Piccoli 1', 'Due to the complexity and protracted history of this litigation, we omit portions of the facts and travel not relevant to our review.', '-2- moved to substitute Shine, in his capacity as receiver, as plaintiff in the litigation. The record does not indicate whether this motion was granted or even considered, but several subsequent motions list “Allan M. Shine, Receiver for Piccoli & Sons, Inc.” as plaintiff.', 'Discovery commenced, and by 1999, Perini was the sole remaining defendant. 2 On February 19, 1999, Piccoli filed a pretrial memorandum of law. Perini also filed a pretrial memorandum; although the docket sheet does not indicate this memorandum’s filing date, a handwritten note indicates that the clerk’s office received it on March 3, 1999.', 'Shortly thereafter, on March 10, 1999, Piccoli moved to amend its complaint by adding several additional counts against Perini. Perini filed its objection thereto in open court on March 22, 1999. The docket sheet does not indicate that a hearing took place on this date. It also does not indicate whether the court ruled on Piccoli’s motion to amend. The case then sat dormant for approximately nine years. 3', 'On May 8, 2008, Piccoli hand-delivered several filings to a justice of the Superior Court: (1) a pretrial memorandum; (2) a motion to amend its complaint; and (3) a motion to substitute party plaintiff. None of these filings were docketed. In its motion to substitute party plaintiff, Piccoli explained that, after it was petitioned into receivership, the receiver had assigned its claim against Perini to Citizens Bank. Citizens Bank then sold that claim to Fifteenth RMA Partners, LP (Fifteenth RMA Partners), on or about August 22, 1996.', 'A third and final assignment then occurred, making Premier Capital, LLC (Premier Capital) the current holder of 2', 'An order granting the state’s motion for summary judgment was entered on October 30, 1996. Summary judgment entered in Donatelli’s favor on June 15, 1998.

Piccoli therefore moved to substitute Premier Capital as party plaintiff. 4', 'In response, Perini renewed its objection to Piccoli’s motion to amend. Citing G.L. 1956 § 9-2-8, it also objected to Piccoli’s motion to substitute. Section 9-2-8 provides as follows:', '“The assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in action which has', 'been assigned in writing may maintain an action thereon in his or', 'her own name, but subject to all defenses and rights of', 'counterclaim, recoupment, or setoff to which the defendant would', 'have been entitled had the action been brought in the name of the', 'assignor.” Perini argued that, because the exhibits to Piccoli’s motion to substitute—documents which purported to show the transfer of outstanding debts owed to Piccoli—did not constitute an assignment in writing, the court should deny that motion pursuant to § 9-2-8. Perini argued that, in the alternative, the case should be dismissed.', 'The case came before a justice of the Superior Court for a hearing on May 9, 2008. 5 At the outset, the hearing justice agreed with Piccoli’s counsel that Piccoli’s motion to substitute party plaintiff should be heard before its motion to amend. Piccoli reiterated the history of the litigation and the purported transfers of its claim against Perini. It argued that what had occurred was “a straightforward Uniform Commercial Code assignment of assets.” It contended that, because the transferred assets were negotiable instruments, § 9-2-8 did not apply.', 'In response, Perini asserted that § 9-2-8 did, in fact, apply, and further that it operated to bar Piccoli from substituting Premier as party plaintiff. In the alternative, it argued that, if § 9-2- 4', 'Although Piccoli did not identify a court rule under which its motion to substitute was made, Rule 25(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure (“Transfer of Interest”) allows such a motion. 5', 'In its brief to this Court, Piccoli states that the case file was not available during the hearing because the clerk’s office was unable to locate it.', '-4- 8 did not apply, the documents that Piccoli had submitted were “woefully short of anything * * * conclusive that [Premier] ha[d] been assigned this claim [against Perini].”', 'The hearing justice then examined the documents Piccoli had submitted in support of its motion to substitute. Those documents included: (1) a judgment and order dated December 16, 1993, discharging Shine as receiver for Piccoli and assigning to Citizens Trust Company and/or Citizens Savings Bank certain accounts receivable of Piccoli’s for collection; (2) a loan purchase and sale agreement between Citizens Savings Bank/Citizens Trust Company and Fifteenth RMA Partners; and (3) a bill of sale and assignment of assets from Fifteenth RMA Partners to Premier Capital.', 'After reviewing these documents, the hearing justice noted that they did not appear to constitute an assignment of Piccoli’s claim against Perini. He stated that this caused him “some difficulty” since § 9-2-8 requires assignments to be in writing. Finding that this statute did apply, the hearing justice commented that “it would seem to make sense [that] in order for someone to be substituted as a party * * * there has to be a chain of contact and a transfer of an authority from one entity to the other, and I just don’t see it.”', 'Piccoli’s counsel offered additional argument, but the hearing justice concluded that the documents did not show that Piccoli’s claim against Perini had been transferred to Premier Capital. Accordingly, the hearing justice denied Piccoli’s motion to substitute party plaintiff and granted Perini’s motion to dismiss. After judgment was entered on July 14, 2009, Piccoli timely appealed to this Court. 6 6', 'Approximately fourteen months after the hearing on May 9, 2008, the hearing justice wrote to the parties to advise them that judgment had not entered since neither party had submitted an order to the court. Perini quickly rectified this oversight.', '-5-', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The issue on appeal is whether the hearing justice erred in denying Piccoli’s motion to substitute party plaintiff and granting Perini’s motion to dismiss.', 'Piccoli argues that the documents supporting its motion to substitute constituted a written assignment of its claim against Perini—first, from Piccoli to Citizens Bank; second, from Citizens Bank to Fifteenth RMA Partners; and finally, from Fifteenth RMA Partners to Premier Capital. Piccoli explained that, when it was petitioned into receivership, Citizens Bank (as one of Piccoli’s creditors) was assigned all its receivables. Those receivables, Piccoli asserts, included any monies it might recover through this litigation. Piccoli urges us to reverse the Superior Court’s decision so that Premier Capital can be substituted as party plaintiff and proceed against Perini. Perini counters that the documents submitted by Piccoli do not amount to an assignment in writing under § 9-2-8 because they are “woefully vague” and do not specifically acknowledge this claim. 7', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial justice’s conclusions on questions of law de novo.” Beacon Mutual Insurance Co. v. Spino Brothers, Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 649 (R.I. 2011) (citing International Brotherhood of Police Officers v. City of East Providence, 989 A.2d 106, 108 (R.I. 2010)).

We “remain[ ] mindful of the longstanding principle that ‘statutes should not be construed to achieve meaningless or absurd results.’” Id. (quoting Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011)). If we conclude that a statute is unambiguous, we shall apply it as written. Id.', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'First, we must decide whether the trial justice erred in finding that § 9-2-8 applies to Piccoli’s claim against Perini. This statute allows “[t]he assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in action” to “maintain an action thereon in his or her own name” only when that chose in action “has been assigned in writing.” Section 9-2-8. Piccoli contends that § 9-2-8 does not apply to its claim against Perini because what was assigned to Citizens Bank—and ultimately to Premier Capital—were negotiable instruments (to wit, promissory notes) secured by Piccoli’s receivables. It asserts that those receivables include any potential recovery from this lawsuit. 8 However, the fact that this claim may serve as security for a negotiable instrument is immaterial. Section 9-2-8 applies to this case because Piccoli’s claim against Perini is a nonnegotiable “chose in action.” See Black’s Law Dictionary 275 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “chose in action” as “[a] proprietary right in personam, such as a debt owed by another person” or “[t]he right to bring an action to recover a debt, money, or thing”); see also § 9-2-8.', 'Next, we consider whether the documents supporting Piccoli’s motion to substitute satisfy § 9-2-8’s requirement of a written assignment. One of those documents is a judgment and order dated December 16, 1993, discharging Shine as receiver for Piccoli. That document 8', 'This assertion is unsupported by the evidence. Furthermore, if Premier Capital could potentially stand to benefit from this lawsuit, we question why it has not sought to vindicate its rights by intervening in this action.', '-7- directs Shine “to assign to Citizens Trust Company and/or Citizens Savings Bank [Piccoli’s] outstanding accounts receivable for collection, the claim with respect to a refund from the bonding company regarding Citizens’ letter of credit, the claim regarding the cashing of a check with improper endorsement and the claim involving Dimeo Corp. * * *.” Additionally, Piccoli submitted (1) a loan purchase and sale agreement between Citizens Bank and Fifteenth RMA Partners; and (2) a bill of sale and assignment of assets between Fifteenth RMA Partners and Premier Capital. Because none of these three documents refers to Piccoli’s claim against Perini, these documents do not constitute a written assignment of that claim, as required by § 9-2-8. It should go without saying that a written assignment of a claim must identify the claim itself. We therefore affirm the trial justice’s denial of Piccoli’s motion to substitute.', 'Finally, we review the Superior Court’s decision to dismiss the action. Piccoli was dissolved on December 16, 1993, pursuant to the Superior Court’s order and judgment. Rule 17(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[e]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.” A defunct corporation cannot be considered a “real party in interest” under that rule. When Piccoli was dissolved in 1993, state law provided that a dissolved corporation “nevertheless continues for two (2) years after the date of the dissolution * * * for the purpose of enabling it to settle and close its affairs, to dispose of and convey its property, to discharge its liabilities, and to distribute its assets * * *.” See G.L. 1956 § 7-1.1-98.1 (current version at § 7-1.2-1325). 9 Under this statute, Piccoli had until late 1995 to wind up its affairs after dissolution. Its claim against Perini should have been resolved within this timeframe. As a defunct corporation, Piccoli can no longer maintain this action in its own 9', 'The current version of this statute provides for a five-year wind-up period.

55,"State of Rhode Island, Department of : Corrections v. : Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional : Officers.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (the DOC) is charged with “the custody, care, discipline, training, treatment, and study of persons committed to state correctional institutions or on probation or parole * * *.” See G.L. 1956 § 42- 56-1(b). The Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers (the union) is the certified bargaining unit for correctional officers and certain other DOC employees. The parties’ dispute stems from the DOC’s proposal to modify the weapons qualification component of the training program for correctional officers. The union filed a grievance, arguing that the training program could not be modified without the approval of a training committee that had been created under the parties’ collective bargaining agreement (the CBA). An arbitrator agreed and ruled in the union’s favor. After the Superior Court confirmed the arbitration award, the DOC sought redress before this Court. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The CBA, which was in effect at all times relevant to this appeal, contains several provisions that are central to the parties’ dispute. One of those provisions is Article XXXI, section 31.1, which requires the DOC to “offer a minimum of forty (40) hours per year of training to all uniformed Correctional Officers.” Section 31.2 creates a training committee. Composed of two representatives of the DOC and two representatives of the union, it is charged with “submit[ting] a comprehensive program pertinent to the training of Correctional Officers * * *.”', 'Another key provision of the CBA relates to weapons qualification. 1 Section 31.3 states that “[e]mployees who are required to engage in a weapons qualification shall do so on [s]tate time.” Furthermore, it provides that “[t]he time frame for qualifying shall be one (1) year from the date of the officer’s last qualification * * *.” This litigation, and the arbitration that preceded it, centers on the DOC’s statutory and contractual obligations regarding weapons qualification.', 'In 1959, the General Assembly enacted a statute that required law enforcement officers in Rhode Island to undergo weapons qualification prior to their appointment. G.L. 1956 § 11-47- 17, as enacted by P.L. 1959, ch. 75, § 1. The statute also required law enforcement officers to “repeat this qualification at periods of not more than one year.” Id. In 2007, § 11-47-17 was amended to provide that “correctional officers * * * must repeat [weapons] qualification every two (2) years.” 2 P.L. 2007, ch. 73, art. 3, § 15. 1', 'The term “weapons qualification” refers to the statutorily-mandated process by which law enforcement and correctional officers in Rhode Island earn the privilege of carrying a firearm. See G.L. 1956 §§ 11-47-15.1, 11-47-17, 11-47-17.1. 2', 'The record indicates that the then-governor endorsed this amendment, which he recommended “[i]n order to reduce overtime costs.” A document prepared by the House Fiscal Advisory Staff', '-2-', 'After the Legislature amended § 11-47-17, the DOC intended to conduct live, on-range weapons qualification every two years, instead of annually, as it had done in the past. For the years in which it would not conduct live weapons training, the DOC purchased a computer system, known as Prism, for simulated weapons training. It then sought the training committee’s approval to implement this system. At a meeting of the training committee held on March 12, 2008, one of the union’s representatives stated that the union was opposed to the use of the Prism system. Two days later, at another training committee meeting, the same union representative reiterated this stance. The meeting minutes from March 14, 2008, reflect that both the DOC and the union intended to consult with counsel regarding the impasse on this issue. 3 The matter then proceeded to arbitration.', 'An arbitrator heard the grievance on May 28, 2008; both parties were represented by counsel. In a written decision submitted on June 13, 2008, the arbitrator ruled in the union’s favor. He framed the issue before him as follows: “Would it violate the [CBA] for the [DOC] to change the weapons qualification component of the * * * in-service training program if a majority of the [t]raining [c]ommittee has not adopted that change?”', 'Relying on previous arbitration decisions, he first decided that the grievance was arbitrable. He characterized the dispute before him as one “involv[ing] the interpretation and also states that “[t]he Governor recommended [the amendment] to allow biennial weapons requalification for correctional officers instead of annual requalification for savings of $544,824.” Although these documents are helpful in understanding the background against which this dispute unfolded (and, therefore, in determining whether the dispute is arbitrable), as we explain below, they do not bear upon our analysis of the merits of this appeal. See Such v. State, 950 A.2d 1150, 1158 (R.I. 2008) (“There is no recorded legislative history in Rhode Island from which to ascertain legislative intent.” quoting Laird v. Chrysler Corp., 460 A.2d 425, 428 (R.I. 1983)). Additionally, although a similar amendment was made to § 11-47-17.1, for simplicity’s sake, this opinion refers only to § 11-47-17. 3', 'Although it does not appear that a formal vote was taken, the two union representatives and the two DOC representatives were deadlocked on this issue.', '-3- application of [section] 31.2”—the training committee provision of the CBA. In his view, the dispute “[fell] squarely within the definition of an arbitrable grievance under [s]ection 18.3 [of Article XVIII] of the [CBA].” 4 He also rejected the DOC’s argument that § 42-56-10(14) gave its director the non-delegable (and therefore non-arbitrable) right to control training. 5 Additionally, he found that a recent amendment to that statute supported his conclusion that the dispute was arbitrable. 6', 'The arbitrator then considered the merits of the union’s grievance. He explained that the effect of a deadlock among the members of the training committee had already been settled by prior arbitration awards between the parties. Quoting a 2004 decision of Arbitrator Boulanger, he stated that “[i]f the [t]raining [c]ommittee deadlocks * * * the disputed training component does not change.” He dismissed the DOC’s contention that it was statutorily obligated to discontinue annual weapons qualification and therefore had to implement the Prism system to meet its contractual obligation to provide forty annual hours of training to correctional officers. The arbitrator found that, although the amendment to § 11-47-17 eliminated the DOC’s obligation to conduct annual weapons qualification, it did not preclude the DOC from doing so. 4', 'Section 18.3 of Article XVIII provides for the arbitration of “grievances arising out of the provisions of this contract relating to the application or interpretation thereof * * *.” 5', 'That statute confers upon the DOC’s director the authority to “[e]stablish training programs for [DOC] employees.” G.L. 1956 § 42-56-10(14). 6', 'That amendment reads as follows:', '“Notwithstanding the enumeration of the powers of the', 'director [of the DOC] as set forth in this section, and', 'notwithstanding any other provision of the general laws, the', 'validity and enforceability of the provisions of a collective', 'bargaining agreement shall not be contested, affected, or', 'diminished, nor shall any arbitration award be vacated, remanded,', 'or set aside on the basis of an alleged conflict with this section or', 'with any other provision of the [g]eneral [l]aws.” Section 42-56-', '10(24), as amended by P.L. 2007, ch. 523, § 1.', '-4-', 'The arbitrator also considered the DOC’s claimed fiscal inability to pay for live, on-range weapons qualification. He found that, “under the reasoning of [Arbitrator Boulanger’s 2004 decision], the [DOC] was aware [that] it was contractually obligated to continue the existing weapons qualification component of the in-service training program until the [t]raining [c]ommittee adopted an alternative * * *.” The DOC, he wrote, “could have planned for the contingency that a majority of the [t]raining [c]ommittee would be unable to agree to an alternative.” The arbitrator concluded that, despite the DOC’s “difficult fiscal picture,” he could not ignore the plain language of the CBA, which required annual on-range weapons qualification.', 'Finally, the arbitrator rejected the DOC’s assertion that it would be unable to satisfy the CBA’s requirement that it offer forty hours of annual training to correctional officers (per section 31.1) unless it were allowed to implement the Prism system in lieu of on-range weapons qualification. Because Arbitrator Boulanger’s 2004 decision (which the DOC did not appeal) had made it clear that the status quo would be preserved if the training committee deadlocked, he “conclude[d] that the [DOC could] not change the content of the in-service training program, including the weapons qualification component, unless a majority of the [t]raining [c]ommittee first adopt[ed] that change.” The DOC, he found, could meet the forty-hour requirement by conducting annual on-range weapons qualification, as it had in previous years.', 'On August 20, 2008, the DOC filed a petition in the Superior Court seeking to vacate, or, in the alternative, modify, the arbitration award, pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 28-9-18(a) and 28-9- 20. The union responded on September 8, 2008, by filing a motion to confirm the arbitration award, pursuant to § 28-9-17. The parties then filed memoranda in support of their respective positions.', '-5-', 'The DOC characterized the parties’ dispute as “outside the purview of the arbitrator’s jurisdiction.” In the DOC’s view, § 11-47-17 set forth a clear employment requirement that correctional officers undergo weapons qualification every two years. Citing to a prior decision of this Court, it asserted that this statutory requirement directly conflicted with the CBA provision regarding weapons qualification and, therefore, could not be arbitrated. See State (Department of Administration) v. Rhode Island Council 94, A.F.S.C.M.E., AFL-CIO, Local 2409, 925 A.2d 939, 945 (R.I. 2007) (“[A] valid employment requirement prescribed by state law cannot be negotiated and is not a proper subject for arbitration.” quoting Town of West Warwick v. Local 2045, Council 94, 714 A.2d 611, 612 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). The DOC also claimed that its director had a statutory duty to train correctional officers that was non-delegable and therefore non-arbitrable. Furthermore, it contended that § 42-56-10(24) did not preclude the court from vacating the arbitration award. It argued that the union’s interpretation of that statute violated the principle of separation of powers and was therefore unconstitutional.', 'In opposition, the union cited § 42-56-10(24) in support of its argument that the grievance was indeed arbitrable. It also asserted that the grievance was not rendered inarbitrable by virtue of any provision of § 42-56-10 or the management rights clause of the CBA. 7 It argued that § 11-47-17 did not directly conflict with the CBA provision regarding weapons qualification. Finally, it urged the court to confirm the arbitration award, as it represented a rational interpretation of the CBA based on the decisions of previous arbitrators.', 'After reviewing the parties’ memoranda, a justice of the Superior Court issued a written decision on August 18, 2010. Rejecting the DOC’s argument that § 42-56-10(14) prevented the 7', 'That provision of the CBA, section 4.1 of Article IV, vests management rights solely with the DOC, “except as limited, abridged, or relinquished by [other] terms and provisions of [the CBA].”', '-6- arbitration of the dispute, he first concluded that the dispute was arbitrable. He noted that § 42- 56-10(24) specifically states that “[no] * * * arbitration award [shall] be vacated, remanded, or set aside on the basis of an alleged conflict with this section or with any other provision of the [G]eneral [L]aws.”', 'Reaching the merits of the dispute, and relying on Hart Engineering Co. v. Pawtucket Water Supply Board, 560 A.2d 329, 330 (R.I. 1989), the justice found that “the award draws its essence from [section 31.2 of] the contract.” He also found that the arbitrator’s conclusion—that proposed changes to the training program could not be implemented without the training committee’s approval—was “based upon a ‘passably plausible’ interpretation of the contract.” See id. Finally, he found that the arbitrator had not exhibited a manifest disregard for the law in concluding that § 11-47-17 did not preclude annual weapons qualification for correctional officers. Accordingly, the Superior Court confirmed the arbitration award in its entirety.', 'Final judgment was entered on September 13, 2010. On October 18, 2010, the DOC moved for an extension of time to file its notice of appeal. After that motion was granted on November 1, 2010, it filed its notice of appeal on the same day.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, the DOC first argues that ensuring appropriate weapons training is a non- delegable and non-arbitrable statutory duty of its director. Second, it contends that § 11-47-17 sets forth a valid employment requirement that directly conflicts with the CBA. Although the CBA requires annual weapons qualification, the DOC asserts that the CBA is trumped by § 11-', '-7- 47-17, which mandates biennial weapons qualification for correctional officers. 8 Finally, it maintains that § 42-56-10(24) does not preclude this Court from vacating the arbitration award.', 'In response, the union argues that the grievance is arbitrable and that § 11-47-17 cannot excuse the DOC from its obligations under the CBA. It denies that a direct conflict exists between section 31.3 of the CBA and §§ 11-47-17 or 42-56-10(14).

In his decision, the arbitrator explained that, “in early 2007, * * * the [g]overnor asked the [DOC] to propose cost[-]saving measures to address the [s]tate’s fiscal problems. In response, the [DOC] proposed that the annual weapons qualification requirement for [correctional officers] be changed to require [correctional officers] to qualify every two years.” Additionally, the arbitrator noted that the DOC “contend[ed] that it simply ha[d] no money to pay for weapons qualification [in 2008].” It is clear to us that the DOC’s proposal to abandon yearly on-range weapons qualification was based on budgetary concerns.', 'The DOC contends that, pursuant to § 42-56-10(14), its director has the statutory authority and duty to “establish training programs” for its employees. However, the statute does not specify that this authority and duty is exclusive. As in North Providence School Committee, the union is “statutorily entitled to negotiate over matters that directly affect the work and welfare of [its] members * * *.” See 945 A.2d at 346; § 28-9-1 (“controversies respecting terms and conditions of employment” are arbitrable). Thus, the statute does not prevent the DOC’s', '- 10 - director from exercising this power in consultation with the union. This dispute is therefore arbitrable. 9 We now turn to the merits of the arbitration award.', 'B', 'Merits', 'In determining that the DOC lacked the authority to implement the Prism system without the training committee’s approval, the arbitrator based his reasoning upon the award of a previous arbitrator who had decided a similar dispute between the parties.', 'He stated that Arbitrator Boulanger’s 2004 decision “could not have been any clearer on” the effect of a deadlock among the members of the training committee. Quoting that prior award, he stated that “[i]f the [t]raining [c]ommittee deadlocks * * * the disputed training component does not change.” 10', 'The arbitrator then rejected the DOC’s argument that § 11-47-17 prohibited it from complying with the CBA’s requirement of annual weapons qualification. He determined that this statute did not directly conflict with that provision of the CBA, explaining that he read this statute “to create an exception to the required annual weapons qualification for other kinds of law enforcement officers.” He found that, although the DOC was no longer statutorily obligated to have correctional officers complete weapons qualification on an annual basis, it was not statutorily precluded from doing so. 9', 'In concluding that the dispute was arbitrable, the Superior Court justice based his decision on § 42-56-10(24), which purports to limit the judiciary’s review of arbitration awards involving the DOC. Because our conclusion on arbitrability has a different basis, and because of the well- settled doctrine of constitutional avoidance, we need not decide whether § 42-56-10(24) violates the principle of separation of powers. See In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2006) (“Neither this Court nor the Superior Court should decide constitutional issues unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.”). 10', 'In its brief, the DOC states that it “has struggled considerably with the challenge of making this [prior] award workable,” but admits that it did not seek to have that award modified or vacated. The present dispute, then, is something of a self-inflicted wound.', '- 11 -', 'A close examination of § 11-47-17 demonstrates that the arbitrator’s decision was passably plausible. That statute provides that law enforcement officers must “repeat [weapons] qualification at periods of not more than one year, except for correctional officers who must repeat this qualification every two (2) years.” Section 11-47-17, as amended by P.L. 2007, ch. 73, art. 3, § 15. The arbitrator read that statute to mean that correctional officers were required to undergo weapons qualification at least every two years. He found that the statute prescribed a maximum time period, rather than a minimum or fixed time period, within which correctional officers must complete weapons qualification. Such an interpretation was passably plausible.', 'We emphasize that, in reviewing the arbitration award, we do not engage in our usual de novo review of statutes and contracts. Rather, precedent dictates that our task is merely to decide whether his interpretation of the CBA was passably plausible and did not manifestly disregard the law. See Cumberland Teachers Association, 45 A.3d at 1192. Given the limited scope of our review of arbitration awards, we cannot disturb the arbitrator’s determination that the DOC could not modify the weapons qualification component of the training program without the training committee’s approval and that it was not statutorily precluded from fulfilling its contractual obligation to conduct annual weapons qualification.', 'Because we hold that the arbitrator’s interpretation of the CBA was passably plausible, did not reflect a manifest disregard for the law, and was not irrational, the arbitration award must stand.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 12 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State of Rhode Island, Department of Corrections v.

56,(P3/07-483A) (P3/07-484A) (P3/07-485A) State : v. : Gualter Botas.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the record, the memoranda submitted to this Court on behalf of the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 1, 2008, a Providence County Superior Court jury found defendant Gualter Botas guilty of seven counts of simple assault. At the time of the alleged incidents, Mr. Botas was a captain at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI); he was also the shift', '-1- commander and the highest ranking uniformed officer on the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift at the ACI‘s minimum security facility. The simple assault charges leveled against Capt. Botas related to his treatment of four ACI inmates: Robert Houghton, Anthony Romano, Jose Gonzalez, and Matthew Gumkowski.', 'Captain Botas‘s appeal has much in common with an appeal that we have already decided, namely State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232 (R.I. 2012). That case involved Kenneth Viveiros, who was a lieutenant at the ACI and worked the same shift as Capt. Botas. Lieutenant Viveiros stood trial alongside Capt. Botas and was convicted on four counts of simple assault. Lieutenant Viveiros‘s convictions were affirmed by this Court on appeal.', 'As was true in Viveiros, this case ―presents a rare look into the dark side of prison life and the human cost and institutional consequences that result when rogue correctional officers deviate from established prison standards.‖ See Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1235. Mr. Houghton, Mr. Romano, and Mr. Gonzalez all testified that Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros assaulted and abused them behind closed doors at the ACI.1 The three inmates testified that those assaults took place with both Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros in the room.2', 'This Court has already provided a thorough discussion of the underlying facts and travel in its Viveiros opinion. This opinion will assume familiarity with that earlier opinion and will 1', 'Only Capt. Botas, and not Lt. Viveiros, was charged with assaulting Matthew Gumkowski. 2', 'A third correctional officer, Ernest Spaziano, Jr., was allegedly present during the assaults involving Robert Houghton and Jose Gonzalez. Officer Spaziano was charged with a single count of simple assault, with Mr. Gonzalez being the alleged victim. The trial justice, however, declined the prosecution‘s motion to join Officer Spaziano‘s case with those of Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros, finding that ―Spaziano—who faced a single count of assault—would face ‗a serious likelihood of substantial prejudice‘ were the court to order joinder.‖ See State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1238 (R.I. 2012).', '-2- therefore briefly summarize only the most pertinent aspects of the facts and travel narrated in the earlier opinion.', 'In addition, we shall narrate the pertinent facts relating to the assault on Matthew Gumkowski.', 'The jury convicted Capt. Botas of one count of simple assault against inmate Robert Houghton. Mr. Houghton testified that, on the morning of December 23, 2005, he was escorted from a holding cell to Capt. Botas‘s office, where Officer Spaziano, Lt. Viveiros, and Capt. Botas were waiting. Mr. Houghton told the jury that the officers questioned him as to whether he had information about a particular member of his prison work crew. Mr. Houghton testified that, during the interrogation, Capt. Botas hit him with a telephone book and Lt. Viveiros ―backhanded‖ him.', 'Captain Botas was also tried and convicted of three counts of simple assault against inmate Anthony Romano. Mr. Romano testified that, on January 30, 2006, Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros assaulted him during a series of interrogations at the ACI. He said that the two officers were questioning him about a telephone number that had been found on a piece of paper in his pocket a few days earlier. Mr. Romano stated that Lt. Viveiros hit him on the head with both a plastic clipboard and a telephone book. Mr. Romano also stated that Capt. Botas ―backhanded‖ him and pushed him into a metal file cabinet.', 'The jury also convicted Capt. Botas of two counts of simple assault against inmate Jose Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez testified that, on the morning of February 14, 2006, he went to see Capt. Botas to speak with him about food that had been seized from Mr. Gonzalez‘s locker the night before.', 'He stated that, upon encountering Capt. Botas, he mistakenly called him ―Lieutenant.‖ Mr. Gonzalez testified that Capt. Botas became ―very angry‖ and smacked him in', '-3- the face ―a couple of times.‖ Mr. Gonzalez also stated that Capt. Botas hit him in the head with a bag of food, a package of paper, and a telephone book.', 'The jury convicted Capt. Botas of one count of simple assault against inmate Matthew Gumkowski. Mr. Gumkowski told the jury that, on June 7, 2005, he was ―caught with * * * a $20 bill‖ by a correctional officer in a prison bathroom. Mr. Gumkowski testified that, on the following morning, he was called down to the front desk of the facility. Mr. Gumkowski stated that, once he arrived, Capt. Botas escorted him to an office where they were joined by Officer Spaziano. Mr. Gumkowski told the jury that the officers put him in handcuffs and closed the door and that Capt. Botas then began questioning him about the $20 bill. According to Mr. Gumkowski, he eventually ―got sick of [Capt. Botas] talking to [him],‖ and so he cursed at him. Mr. Gumkowski testified that Capt. Botas responded by punching him in the face, which ―split [him] open right by [his] eye.‖', 'On August 1, 2008, after a trial that lasted for seventeen days, the jury found Capt. Botas guilty on all charges. On September 5, 2008, the trial justice denied Capt. Botas‘s motion for a new trial. The trial justice then sentenced Capt. Botas to a total of three years at the ACI, with eighteen months to serve and the remainder suspended with probation. Captain Botas filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Captain Botas raises five issues on appeal. He contends that the trial justice committed reversible error when he (1) denied Capt. Botas‘s motion to sever his trial from that of Lt. Viveiros; (2) granted the prosecution‘s motion to preclude the testimony of inmate Sebastian Atryzek; (3) denied Capt. Botas‘s motion for a new trial; (4) gave improper jury instructions; and', '-4- (5) admitted evidence that had not been produced by the prosecution during discovery as required by Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Issues Addressed in State v. Viveiros', 'The first four of the just-summarized issues raised on appeal by Capt. Botas were also raised by Lt. Viveiros in his unsuccessful appeal. There is no material difference between the contentions of those two defendants, and our reasons for rejecting those arguments are the same as those articulated in our earlier opinion. See generally Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1240–46.', 'First, it is our opinion that the trial justice acted within his discretion when he denied Capt. Botas‘s motion to sever pursuant to Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.3 This Court has recognized ―that questions of severance based on Rule 14 are within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and we will not disturb his or her decision on appeal absent the showing of a clear abuse of discretion.‖ State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 309 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Captain Botas contends that the ―allegation[s] against co- defendant Viveiros spilled over into the allegations against Captain Botas, his supervisor.‖ We disagree for the same reasons as we articulated in the Viveiros opinion. See Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1240–42. We reiterate that, in the trial of Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros, the trial justice properly 3', 'Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '―If it appears that a defendant or the State is prejudiced by a', 'joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, information,', 'or complaint or by such joinder for trial together, the court may', 'order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of', 'defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.‖', '-5- found ―that the technical requirements for joinder were satisfied because the charged offenses arose from the same acts or transactions or series of acts or transactions.‖ Id. at 1241. The trial justice also carefully reflected on the potential for prejudice, and he concluded that ―Botas and Viveiros would not substantially be prejudiced by the joinder of their cases into one trial.‖ See id.; see also State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 900 (R.I. 2010) (―[A] defendant must show substantial prejudice for this Court to overturn a trial justice‘s denial of a motion for severance.‖).', 'We find Capt. Botas‘s argument concerning the severance issue to be unconvincing.', 'It is further our opinion that the trial justice acted within his discretion when he granted the prosecution‘s motion in limine to preclude the testimony of inmate Sebastian Atryzek. Again, this Court addressed the same argument in the Viveiros opinion. See Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1242–43. Captain Botas sought to call Mr. Atryzek as a witness for the sole purpose of attacking the credibility of Warren Tarsagian, an inmate who had already testified at the trial; specifically, defense counsel advised the trial justice that he anticipated that Mr. Atryzek would testify about having been approached by Mr. Tarsagian, who purportedly told him that ―they would both profit‖ by filing a false assault allegation against Capt. Botas. See id. at 1242. When questioned by defense counsel about the alleged scheme, Mr. Tarsagian testified that he ―[n]ever told [Mr. Atryzek] anything like that.‖ The trial justice properly determined that ―Atryzek‘s testimony would be extrinsic evidence on a collateral issue, which would be prohibited by Rule 608(b)‖ of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1242; see also State v. Tutt, 622 A.2d 459, 462 (R.I. 1993); State v. Bowden, 439 A.2d 263, 268 (R.I. 1982) (―A witness may not be', '-6- impeached on collateral matters by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. The cross-examiner is restricted to the answers of the witness.‖).4', 'Captain Botas‘s next contention on appeal is that the jury instructions were ―confusing and difficult to comprehend,‖ and that the ―jury could not properly segregate the charge[s] in light of the allegations against both defendants.‖ As we stated in Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1244, the record shows that, except for an objection pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence,5 ―neither [Capt. Botas‘s nor Lt. Viveiros‘s] attorney objected to any portion of the court‘s [jury] instructions.‖ Our established raise or waive rule ―precludes our consideration of an issue that has not been raised and articulated at trial.‖ State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828 (R.I. 2008). Accordingly, Capt. Botas, like his codefendant, is deemed to have waived the right to challenge the jury instructions on appeal.', 'Captain Botas next argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial. He maintains that the testimony of the inmate witnesses was not worthy of belief. Yet again, this Court addressed the same argument in Viveiros, stating that ―we are satisfied that the trial justice engaged in a comprehensive and proper analysis of the evidence presented in this case; he reviewed the testimony from both sides and independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses.‖ Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1245. After having once again reviewed the record, we remain 4', 'In his brief filed with this Court, Capt. Botas also states that a ―second motion in limine filed by the State precluded the defendants from introducing evidence of discipline records of the Department of Correction[s] employees listed as State Witnesses.‖ However, the brief does not include a legal argument to accompany that just-quoted statement. Accordingly, we shall not address this issue on appeal. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (―Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.‖). 5', 'The objection to the instructions based upon Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence is not one of the appellate issues raised by Capt. Botas.', '-7- fully satisfied with the analytical process employed by the trial justice in addressing the motion for a new trial and with his ultimate ruling denying the same as to Capt. Botas.', 'B', 'The Rule 16 Issue', 'Captain Botas presents one argument that was not raised in Lt. Viveiros‘s appeal: he contends that the trial justice committed reversible error by allowing the prosecution to introduce certain photographs into evidence at trial.6 Specifically, Capt. Botas argues that the trial justice should have excluded the photographs due to what he contends was a violation by the prosecution of its discovery obligations under Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We disagree.', 'The Rule 16 issue raised by Capt. Botas relates to the assault charges involving Mr. Romano discussed in Part I of this opinion, supra. As previously indicated, Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros allegedly assaulted Mr. Romano during a series of interrogations. Mr. Romano testified that, after the interrogations ended, the three men went to Capt. Botas‘s office. He told the jury that, once they entered the office, ―everything changed‖; he said that the officers began to act as if they were his ―best friend[s].‖ Mr. Romano stated that he apologized to the officers for not answering their questions as they had wanted and that Capt. Botas told him to ―forget about all that.‖ According to Mr. Romano, Capt. Botas then opened his desk drawer and removed a plastic bag containing photographs. Mr. Romano stated that Capt. Botas put the photographs in front of him and told him to ―take a look‖; Mr. Romano said that the photographs were of ―naked 6', 'This Court‘s opinion in Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1237 n.5, does note that ―[p]urportedly * * * Botas showed Romano some inappropriate photos of young girls * * *.‖ However, that opinion does not address those ―inappropriate photos‖ from a legal or evidentiary perspective.', '-8- girls‖ who ―looked like they were teenagers.‖ Mr. Romano testified that Capt. Botas told him that the photographs were to make him ―feel a little better.‖', 'The record indicates that, on July 16, 2008—five days into the jury trial and one day before Mr. Romano was scheduled to testify—defense counsel informed the trial justice that the defense had recently learned that the prosecution intended to introduce the above-referenced photographs, which defense counsel characterized as ―pornographic pictures.‖ Defense counsel argued that the photographs should not be allowed into evidence because they had not been disclosed during discovery.', 'The prosecutor acknowledged that the photographs had not been previously disclosed to defendants. She explained that a state police detective had seized the photographs from Capt. Botas‘s office while working as the lead investigator concerning an assault charge against Capt. Botas relating to his treatment of another inmate at the ACI, one Michael Walsh. Before trial, the prosecution elected to sever the charge against Capt. Botas involving Mr. Walsh. Accordingly, the prosecution had not disclosed the photographs in the consolidated case against Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros. The prosecutor also informed the court that Mr. Romano‘s witness statement—which had been disclosed—mentioned that he had been shown the photographs during his post-interrogation meeting with Capt. Botas and Lt. Viveiros in Capt. Botas‘s office.', 'The trial justice reserved decision and then revisited the issue with the parties the following day.', 'Defense counsel claimed that the defense was being ―ambushed by [the] photographs,‖ and that allowing the photographs into evidence would ―eviscerate‖ what he characterized as the ―defense of bad investigation.‖ Defense counsel also claimed that, if the defense had known about the proposed photographic evidence from the beginning, it ―would', '-9- have addressed [the evidence] in voir dire‖ by inquiring whether the potential jurors would be offended by pornographic photographs.', 'The trial justice recognized that the prosecution had violated Rule 16 by failing to disclose the photographs during discovery. However, he went on to find that the violation was ―clearly unintentional‖; Capt. Botas‘s counsel agreed, noting that he ―[did] not in the least blame‖ the prosecutor for the discovery violation. The trial justice ruled that the photographs could be entered into evidence in spite of the Rule 16 violation. The trial justice did, however, present defendants with remedial options; he stated that he was ―certainly willing‖ to postpone Mr. Romano‘s testimony, which was scheduled for later that day. The trial justice also indicated that he would consider ―adjourn[ing] for a day or two‖ to give defense counsel further time to prepare.7 Defense counsel did not take the trial justice up on either offer. Accordingly, during his testimony, Mr. Romano identified eight photographs as being the photographs that Capt. Botas had shown him on the day of the assault. At that point, the photographs were admitted as full exhibits.', 'Rule 16(i) states that, when faced with a discovery violation, a trial justice ―may order [the offending] party to provide the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material which or testimony of a witness whose identity or statement were not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems appropriate.‖ 8 7', 'Captain Botas was given the opportunity to move to pass the case. Before ruling on the admissibility of the photographs, the trial justice asked defense counsel what his position would be if he allowed the photographs to be admitted into evidence; defense counsel replied, ―I may have to discuss with my client about moving to pass.‖ However, when the time came for the introduction of the photographs, defense counsel made no such motion. 8', 'The pertinent discovery obligations which Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure imposes on the prosecution are as follows:', '- 10 - When determining the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation, the trial justice should look to ―(1) the reason for nondisclosure, (2) the extent of prejudice to the opposing party, (3) the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and (4) any other relevant factors.‖ State v. Vocatura, 922 A.2d 110, 117 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has recognized that ―the trial justice is in the best position to fashion a proper remedy for noncompliance with the discovery rule.‖ State v. Ramos, 553 A.2d 1059, 1068 (R.I. 1989). Accordingly, we review such rulings ―with deference and will not overturn the decision unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.‖ State v. Gonzalez, 923 A.2d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 2007). This Court has also noted that ―the exclusion of testimony is an extreme remedy and should be applied sparingly.‖ State v.

57,State : v. : James Gaffney. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 6, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant, James Gaffney, was charged with two counts of felony assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. The defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding him guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple assault (count 1) and of a “serious bodily injury” felony assault (count 2).1 On March 23, 2011, the trial justice heard and denied the defendant‟s motion for a new trial. The defendant was sentenced to serve one year at the Adult Correctional Institutions on count 12 and to a concurrent fifteen-year sentence on count 2, with five years to serve, the balance suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial. 1', 'Although defendant filed his notice of appeal prior to the October 21, 2011 entry of judgment, we treat the appeal as though it had been filed after the entry of judgment, in accordance with Article I, Rule 4(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. See State v. Baillargeron, 58 A.3d 194, 197 n.5 (R.I. 2013) (citing Azevedo v. State, 945 A.2d 335, 337 n.4 (R.I. 2008)). 2', 'That sentence was to be retroactive to November 3, 2010 because defendant was imprisoned on November 3, 2010 after he was found to be a bail violator.', '-1-', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'At trial, the complainant, April Meneses (Meneses), testified that, on June 10, 2009, she was visiting at defendant‟s Woonsocket, Rhode Island apartment for much of the day and night. According to Meneses, she had known defendant for about ten years: he was a close friend, an “[o]ff and on” love interest, and she frequented his apartment almost daily in order to drink vodka and beer and smoke crack cocaine. Meneses testified that, on June 10, 2009, she arrived at defendant‟s apartment at 11 a.m. and stayed throughout the day; during the course of that visit, she and defendant smoked “a lot” of crack cocaine and each made a trip to the liquor store.', 'Meneses testified that, beyond those basic details, she had no memory of the events that unfolded. In fact, Meneses indicated that she woke up on her sister‟s couch—at some indefinite time after June 10—with a swollen face, bruised eyes and neck, a lump on her forehead, staples in the back of her head, and various other bruises covering her body, but she had no recollection of how she had suffered any of those injuries.', 'The defendant‟s neighbor, Gina Trahan (Trahan), next testified; she explained how she awoke to a loud disturbance, emanating from defendant‟s apartment, between 5 and 6 a.m. on June 11, 2009. She indicated that the walls in the apartment building were “[v]ery thin” and, as a result, she could hear people talking in neighboring apartments. Trahan testified that “[she] was awakened to what sounded like furniture being thrown up against the wall, and screaming, yelling, crying.” She added that she “heard a woman crying, and [she] heard her yelling, „Help', '-2- me.‟”3 According to Trahan, “[she] knew someone was being very badly hurt in that apartment at that time.”', 'Because he had lived in the neighboring apartment for about two years, defendant‟s voice was recognizable to Trahan; she identified defendant‟s voice as one of the two voices she heard in the apartment that morning. Trahan also testified that she knew Meneses “a little bit” because Meneses regularly visited defendant at the apartment; Trahan identified Meneses‟ voice as the one yelling, “Help me.”', 'According to Trahan, she went into the hallway and put her ear “up against the door right before [she] called 9-1-1.” After she called 9-1-1, Trahan heard defendant say, “[s]omeone‟s going to call the police.” After she let the police into the building, Trahan “saw [Meneses] actually fall out of her apartment door, * * * on the floor. * * * [Trahan] saw blood all over the back of her head, and [she] saw blood actually fly across the hallway * * *.”', 'Officer David Wahl (Officer Wahl) testified that he saw defendant—whom Officer Wahl described as looking “a little agitated”—at the door to the apartment building, beyond the security door but before the sliding outside door. Officer Wahl noted that defendant had “blood on his hands.” As he entered the building, Officer Wahl found Meneses on the floor, face-down and bleeding from the back of her head. According to Officer Wahl, Meneses was crying and screaming for help; she also said, “I‟m dying. Call my grandma.” Officer Wahl observed that there were no signs of forced entry, but he indicated that he saw bloodied pieces of concrete on the floor of the apartment as well as broken pieces from the base of a lamp.', 'Similarly, Officer Michael Martufi (Officer Martufi) testified that, when he arrived, he noticed blood on defendant‟s thumb, clothes, and socks. Unlike Officer Wahl, however, Officer 3', 'Trahan later elaborated, stating that “it sounded like someone hit a wall. And as soon as [Trahan] heard that sound, [she] would hear her crying out.” Trahan explained, “it wasn‟t like she was crying softly.

Officer Martufi also testified that he observed “chunks” of what appeared to be ceramic material in Meneses‟s hair; these “chunks,” according to Officer Martufi, seemed to have been part of the base of the nearby broken floor lamp. As for Meneses‟s demeanor, Officer Martufi described her as “out of it,” panting, crying, screaming, and trying to crawl.', 'The state‟s final witness was Jessica Sevigny (Sevigny), a registered nurse on duty at Landmark Medical Center (Landmark) when Meneses arrived for emergency treatment. Sevigny testified that, upon arrival, Meneses was “tachycardic, tachypnea and hypertensive.” In other words, “[h]er heart rate [was] over a hundred, her respiratory rate [was] over 120, and * * * her blood pressure was 120 over 80.” Further, Sevigny indicated that Meneses had black and blue “raccoon eyes.” These observations, along with Meneses‟s vital signs, suggested to the witness that Meneses had suffered an injury severe enough to result in “bleeding into her brain,” which could cause her to “stop breathing” or possibly undergo “cardiac arrest.” Sevigny noted that she was most concerned about the head injury; Meneses‟s black and blue eyes were indicative of a possible skull fracture.', 'As a result, her status was deemed “critical,” and her family was contacted. Sevigny testified that Meneses was “yelling out, screaming, combative” during this time. She also indicated that “there was lots of blood” and that, when asked what happened, Meneses stated that “she got hit in the back of the head * * *.”', 'Sevigny testified that a CT scan was conducted “quickly” to eliminate the possibility of a head injury and bleeding into the brain, either of which, if found, would require treatment at Rhode Island Hospital. The scan included Meneses‟s face, head, and neck. The results of the scan revealed that there was in fact no bleeding into the brain, no broken bones, and no injuries', '-4- to Meneses‟s neck; Meneses‟s head lacerations were then “cleaned and stapled” with six staples to the back of her head.4', 'After the state rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts. With regard to defendant‟s argument on count 2—the only count he challenges before this Court—defendant argued that the testimony presented was insufficient to prove serious bodily injury under any of the relevant statutory criteria.', 'However, based on Sevigny‟s testimony, the trial justice denied the motion. Specifically, the trial justice found that Sevigny‟s description of Meneses‟s appearance at the time of her arrival at Landmark for treatment was sufficient to prove that her physical injuries created a substantial risk of death. Further, the trial justice determined that Sevigny‟s testimony that the staples in Meneses‟s head would leave scarring—and “sometimes hair doesn‟t grow over that scar”—was sufficient to prove that Meneses‟s physical injuries caused a serious permanent disfigurement.', 'After defendant rested his case without taking the stand or presenting any evidence, he renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The trial justice reserved her ruling as to that motion.', 'The jury found defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple assault and battery on count 1 and guilty on count 2 of assault and battery, resulting in serious bodily injury. The defendant immediately moved for a new trial with respect to count 2, felony assault, arguing that “the verdict [was] against the greater weight of evidence.” Additionally, at a March 23, 2011 hearing, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the charge of 4', 'Sevigny testified that stapling the head leaves “a scar, and no hair grows there.” On re-direct examination, in response to the state‟s question, “And you said [stapling] causes scarring on the back of the head?” Sevigny responded, “Yes.” The state followed this answer by asking, “Where you don‟t actually grow hair, correct?” and Sevigny replied, “Yeah, sometimes.”', '-5- felony assault and, further, that the state failed to prove that Meneses‟s injuries constituted serious bodily injury as defined by the statute.', 'The trial justice delivered her decision from the bench. In so doing, she found that the state‟s witnesses were credible: Meneses was “limited in her testimony,” but credible; Trahan, essentially “an eye witness” to the assault, was “very credible,” “presented well,” and “was a good witness”; “[t]he two police officers substantiated the injury, the assault and the condition” of Meneses; “[Sevigny] talked about the injury that, in fact, occurred”; and, overall, they were “all credible witnesses.”', 'As to the evidence, the trial justice “found the evidence to be credible[.]” In addressing the sufficiency of the evidence as to the supplemental motion for new trial and the reserved motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial justice concluded that “the assault that [Meneses] sustained, and the testimony of [Sevigny] justifies a finding of the assault causing serious injury.” Furthermore, “look[ing] at the standard which is that which creates a substantial risk of death,” the trial justice determined “that the testimony gives the jury that evidence for them to consider.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the testimony adduced at trial did not establish that Meneses‟s injuries created a substantial risk of death. The defendant points to the CT scan finding that there was no bleeding into Meneses‟s brain, or a skull fracture, or neck injuries, and argues that there was no meaningful connection between Meneses‟s head wound and her critical condition upon arrival at the hospital. The defendant suggests that her elevated vital signs were symptomatic of her use of drugs.5 He therefore contends that, “even looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any injuries inflicted by [defendant] created a substantial risk of death.” 5', 'There was no evidence of this connection with drugs in the record.', '-6-', 'Meanwhile, in support of his contention that there was insufficient evidence that Meneses‟s injuries caused serious permanent disfigurement, defendant argues that there was no evidence that Meneses has a resulting permanent mark or scar, and that Sevigny testified that staples may “sometimes” cause scars where hair does not grow. The defendant relies on State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 573 (R.I. 2009) for the proposition that a “serious permanent disfigurement” requires “an everlasting disfigurement * * * that is grave and not trivial in quality or manner.” Here, according to defendant, there was no evidence that the staples in Meneses‟s head left any permanent scars, and thus, there was no evidence to support a finding of serious permanent disfigurement.', 'Standard of Review', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal6 and for a new trial.7 This Court has explained that “prevailing on an acquittal motion is a heavier burden for a defendant because the trial justice „must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state‟s witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.‟” State v.

The witnesses described chunks of ceramic material near the bleeding head wound. Other witnesses testified to substantial bruising and significant amounts of blood. With that testimony in mind, we turn to the “substantial risk of death” prong of § 11-5-2. When the trial justice assessed “substantial risk of death,” she focused her analysis on the evidence of Meneses‟s injuries from the vantage point of the medical professionals who treated her at Landmark. Specifically, the trial justice found that the visible injuries—“raccoon eyes,” head laceration, and elevated vital signs—rendered Meneses in “critical” condition such that the jury could have found a substantial risk of death from the beating and its resultant injuries. Ultimately, the trial justice relied on these findings when she concluded that the state had presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a “serious bodily injury.” We discern no error in that conclusion.', 'Section 11-5-2 focuses on the conduct of a defendant and whether his or her assault upon another “results in serious bodily injury,” that is, results in a “physical injury” that “[c]reates a substantial risk of death.” Section 11-5-2(a), (c)(1). The statute does not require that the victim of the assault be rendered objectively or clinically at risk of death. Rather, the statute frames the issue as whether the conduct of a defendant, in assaulting the victim, “[c]reates a substantial risk of death.” Section 11-5-2(c)(1). Here, the issue is whether a savage beating causing substantial bleeding, “raccoon eyes,” abnormal and elevated vital signs, and a head wound requiring six', '- 10 - staples created a substantial risk of death.', 'Taken as a whole, the totality of the evidence of this brutal assault—including the multiple blows to Meneses‟s head, the resultant bleeding and bruised “raccoon eyes,” her elevated vital signs, combined with the classification of Meneses as “critical” upon her arrival at Landmark, and Landmark‟s response to the injuries as life-threatening—is sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude there was a substantial risk of death. Indeed, the risk of death was considered substantial enough that Landmark‟s medical staff contacted Meneses‟s family. These readily apparent signs of injury were indicative of a variety of life-threatening conditions, such as a skull fracture, brain bleed, spine injury, and the risk of cardiac arrest. Accordingly, in light of the evidence concerning the multitude as well as the extent of the injuries Meneses sustained, we are satisfied that a jury properly could conclude that this beating created a risk of death to Meneses as required by § 11-5-2. Indeed, we cannot say as a matter of law that the jury could not reasonably have found that Meneses suffered a “serious physical injury.” We conclude that the “serious physical injury” component of the statute satisfactorily was demonstrated and that, accordingly, there was sufficient evidence adduced to support a conviction of felony assault.', 'Because we affirm the trial justice‟s decision on the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not reach the question of whether the evidence presented was sufficient to support a finding of serious permanent disfigurement.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'Our decision with respect to the defendant‟s motion for new trial renders any analysis of the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal unnecessary.

58,(PC 10-5899) Karen McAninch et al. : v. : State of Rhode Island Department of Labor : and Training et al.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Karen McAninch, business agent for United Service and Allied Workers of Rhode Island (USAW-RI), seeks review of a judgment of the Superior Court that dismissed her complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The plaintiff had filed a complaint in the Superior Court under G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15 of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), seeking judicial review of a decision of the State of Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (DLT). The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred when she found that the plaintiff was tardy in filing her complaint after the statutory timeframe for doing so had expired. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on February 27, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this matter should not summarily be decided.', 'After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the case at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff is the business agent for a labor organization that represents former employees of the Providence Public Library (the library). On June 30, 2009, the final day of the library’s fiscal year, the library terminated the employment of thirty-eight union and eight nonunion employees. On July 9, 2009, plaintiff filed a complaint with the DLT’s Division of Labor Standards. The complaint alleged that the library had failed to pay the employees a total of $149,482.82 in vacation pay that the employees had accrued at the time of their termination. McAninch argued that, under USAW-RI’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA), as well as the library’s employee manual, the employees were entitled to the vacation time for the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2009. The library, on the other hand, argued that the vacation pay did not accrue until July 1, 2009, and because the employees were terminated on the previous day, they were not entitled to the vacation pay.', 'On July 8, 2010, a hearing officer of the DLT conducted a hearing. In a written decision, he held that, under the CBA and employee handbook, the employees’ vacation time accrued on July 1 of each fiscal year. Because the employees were not employed on that date, he concluded that they were not entitled to any vacation pay for the previous year. The DLT decision was mailed to the parties on September 9, 2010. The plaintiff then filed a complaint in the Superior Court on October 12, 2010, seeking judicial review of the DLT’s decision. 1 The plaintiff 1', 'The plaintiff contends that the complaint that was filed on October 12, 2010 was hand delivered to the clerk’s office on that date, and an identical complaint also had been mailed to the clerk’s office on October 8, but was not filed until October 13. As a result, two case files were opened by the clerk’s office, but the files were later consolidated. However, for purposes of determining whether the complaint was timely filed, we will employ the October 12 date, because it is the earlier of the two filing dates.', '-2- requested that the court reverse that decision and order the library to remit the requested vacation pay to the affected employees.', 'On October 5, 2011, the trial justice issued a written decision in which she dismissed plaintiff’s appeal “due to lack of jurisdiction,” holding that the complaint had not been timely filed.', 'The trial justice raised the jurisdictional issue sua sponte, holding that “[i]f an administrative appeal is untimely filed, the [c]ourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction.” She also concluded that administrative appeals are not civil actions, but rather that they are appellate in nature. Thus, she held that such appeals are analogous to this Court’s review of Superior Court decisions. According to the trial justice, adherence to the time limitations for filings in this Court are “mandatory,” and therefore she held that “Rule 6 of the [Superior Court] Rules of Civil Procedure—which extends the last day in computing any time period to the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor holiday—is not applicable and does not govern the review proceedings for an administrative appeal.” Further, she found that “§ 42-35-15 does not provide for an extension of time for ‘excusable neglect.’”', 'Accordingly, the trial justice held that, under the clear and unambiguous language of § 42-35-15(b), plaintiff had exactly thirty days within which to file its complaint in the Superior Court, which meant that plaintiff had “until October 9, 2010 to file a timely appeal.” Because plaintiff’s complaint was not filed until October 12, 2010, the trial justice concluded that the court “lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction over th[e] matter,” and she dismissed the case, even though October 9, 10, and 11 comprised the Columbus Day weekend.

City of Providence, 508 A.2d 661, 665 (R.I. 1986)). However, in this case, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred when she held that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over an administrative appeal that she had determined', '-5- was untimely filed. Nonetheless, it is our task to decide whether plaintiff’s appeal was, in fact, timely filed, and thus, whether the Superior Court’s jurisdiction was properly invoked.', 'B', 'Applicability of Rule 6 to Administrative Appeals', 'In her decision, the trial justice held that Rule 6 “is not applicable and does not govern the review proceedings for an administrative appeal.” The plaintiff contends that this holding was erroneous and that Rule 6 should be applied in such appeals, based not only on the rule’s clear language, but also on the language of Rules 80(c) 2 and 81 3 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, plaintiff argues that, because the last day to file the complaint fell on the 2', 'Rule 80(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states, in pertinent part, that “[t]hese rules, so far as they are applicable, shall govern the review proceedings.” 3', 'Rule 81 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part,', '“(a) To What Proceedings Applicable.', '“(1) These rules do not apply during the process and pleading', 'stages to the following proceedings:', '“Probate appeals', '“Proceedings in condemnation', '“Petitions for enforcement of mechanics’ liens', '“Statutory petitions for receiverships and for dissolution of', 'corporations.', '“(2) These rules do not apply to the following proceedings:', '“Assignments for benefit of creditors', '“Petitions for foreclosure of redemption of interests in land sold', 'for nonpayment of taxes', '“Naturalization proceedings', '“Prerogative writs except where governed by this rule or Rule', '80.', '“(3) These rules do not apply to petitions for the writ of habeas', 'corpus.', '“* * *', '“(e) * * * In applying these rules to any proceedings to which', 'they are applicable, the terminology of any statute which is also', 'applicable, where inconsistent with that in these rules, shall be', 'taken to mean the device or procedure proper under these rules.”', '-6- Saturday of Columbus Day weekend, Rule 6 should have extended that deadline to October 12, the Tuesday after the legal holiday. As a result, plaintiff urges this Court to hold that her complaint was timely filed.', 'The defendants, on the other hand, argue that Rule 6 is not applicable to administrative appeals based on this Court’s decision in Pizzi v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 857 A.2d 762 (R.I. 2004) (mem.). Furthermore, defendants cite Rule 80(b), which says that “[t]he time within which review [of an administrative action] may be sought shall be provided by law.” (Emphasis added.) The defendants contend that § 42-35-15(b) unambiguously granted plaintiff thirty days within which to file a complaint for review and that Rule 6 cannot be used to elongate this timeframe. 4 However, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that Rule 6 should apply in administrative appeals, and, therefore, plaintiff’s complaint was timely filed.', 'Rule 6(a) provides that', '“[i]n computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these', 'rules, by order of court or by any applicable statute, the day of the', 'act, event, or default after which the designated period of time', 'begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period is to', 'be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in', 'which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is', 'neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a holiday.” In the past, this Court has held that “[s]tatutes prescribing the time and procedure to be followed by a litigant attempting to secure appellate review are to be strictly construed.” Rivera, slip op. at 12 (quoting Sousa v. Town of Coventry, 774 A.2d 812, 814 (R.I. 2001)). However, this does not mean that the timeframes set forth in those statutes are utterly inflexible. See id. at 13 (holding that “the Superior Court has the equitable authority to determine whether the statute providing 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-35-15(b) provides, in pertinent part, that “[p]roceedings for review [of administrative actions] are instituted by filing a complaint * * * within thirty (30) days after mailing notice of the final decision of the agency * * *.”', '-7- for judicial review of an administrative decision pursuant to § 42-35-15(b) should be tolled in appropriate circumstances”).', 'Rule 80(b) says that “[t]he time within which review [of an administrative action] may be sought shall be provided by law.” To determine what law should cabin that timeframe, defendants urge this Court to look no further than § 42-35-15(b), which allows an aggrieved party thirty days within which to file a complaint. However, statutes are not the only “law” to which this Court must look; case law as well as court rules also provide guidance. See Carbone v. Planning Board of Appeal of South Kingstown, 702 A.2d 386, 388 (R.I. 1997) (looking to Rule 80(c) to determine whether Rules 15 and 21 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure apply to administrative appeals). Therefore, we shall look to those sources of law as well.', 'The language of Rule 6(a) itself clearly says that it should be applied “[i]n computing any period of time prescribed or allowed * * * by any applicable statute * * *.” (Emphases added.) Furthermore, Rule 80(c), which pertains to reviews of administrative actions, provides that “[t]hese rules [of civil procedure], so far as they are applicable, shall govern the review proceedings.” Finally, Rule 81 lists the types of proceedings to which the Rules of Civil Procedure shall not apply; administrative appeals are not included on that list. Reading all these provisions together, it is our opinion that Rule 6 should apply to the Superior Court’s review of administrative decisions.', 'In addition, our case law directs us to that same conclusion. In Carbone, 702 A.2d at 388-89, this Court addressed the applicability of certain Rules of Civil Procedure to appeals from administrative agencies. In that case, this Court reaffirmed its holding in Mauricio v. Zoning Board of Review of Pawtucket, 590 A.2d 879 (R.I. 1991), in which we held that such appeals were analogous to this Court’s review of lower-court decisions where “the filing of a notice of', '-8- appeal is a sine qua non in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for appellate purposes.” Carbone, 702 A.2d at 388 (quoting Mauricio, 590 A.2d at 880). Thus, Rule 3 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure was held to be inapplicable insofar as it allowed a plaintiff to initiate a civil action by depositing a complaint in the mail. Carbone, 702 A.2d at 388. But we also held that Rules 11, 15 and 21 applied to administrative appeals, and we suggested that other rules, such as Rule 24 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, may also apply. Carbone, 702 A.2d at 389. Finally, this Court held that:', '“By mentioning certain rules, we should not be deemed or', 'construed to be excluding other rules that may meet the general', 'requirements set forth in Rule 1 which commands that the rules of', 'civil procedure be construed and administered ‘to secure the just,', 'speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.’ In short,', 'those rules of civil procedure which are consistent with the nature', 'of an appellate proceeding may be applied in furtherance of that', 'goal.” Id. (quoting Rule 1 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil', 'Procedure). It is noteworthy that Article I, Rule 20(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, which speaks to the computation of time for appellate proceedings, is almost identical to Rule 6(a) of the Superior Court rules, in that it extends the last day in computing any time period to the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a holiday. 5 Thus, we hold that consistency demands that Rule 6(a) applies to the Superior Court’s review of administrative decisions. See Carbone, 702 A.2d at 389. 5', 'Article I, Rule 20(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure provides:', '“In computing any period of time prescribed by these rules, by', 'order of the Court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act,', 'event, or default after which the designated period of time begins', 'to run is not to be included. The last day of the period is to be', 'included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in', 'which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is', 'neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a holiday.”', '-9-', 'The defendants cite this Court’s order in Pizzi, 857 A.2d at 763-64, to support their argument that Rule 6 should not apply to administrative appeals.', 'In that case, the plaintiff sought to extend the period of time within which to appeal an administrative decision based on Rule 6(d), the subsection which adds one extra day to any prescribed time period if that period begins when a party is served by mail. 6 Pizzi, 857 A.2d at 763. This Court dismissed the matter on procedural grounds because the plaintiff had incorrectly sought review by filing an appeal and not a petition for writ of certiorari. Id. The defendants direct us to the language in Pizzi, 857 A.2d at 763-64, which reads as follows:', '“Nevertheless, we note in passing that even if this case were', 'properly before this Court, Rule 6 of the Superior Court Rules of', 'Civil Procedure is of no assistance to Pizzi. Rule 80 of the Superior', 'Court Rules of Civil Procedure explicitly provides that, with', 'respect to Superior Court claims seeking review of agency', 'decisions, ‘[t]he time within which review may be sought shall be', 'provided by law.’ (Emphasis added.) In this circumstance, the', 'governing law is G.L.1956 § 42-35-15(b), which provides that an', 'appeal from an administrative agency decision to the Superior', 'Court must be perfected within thirty days.” According to defendants, this language unequivocally prohibits plaintiff from seizing on Rule 6(a). We do not agree.', 'First, we note that this decision was in the form of a memorandum order—not a full opinion—which gives it little precedential value. Second, the language that defendants rely upon is pure dicta, and it had no bearing on the disposition of the case. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1177 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “obiter dictum” as “[a] judicial comment made while delivering a 6', 'Rule 6(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides:', '“Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or', 'take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service', 'of a notice or other paper upon the party, and the notice or paper is', 'served upon the party by mail, 1 day shall be added to the', 'prescribed period.”', '- 10 - judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential”). Finally, Pizzi, 857 A.2d at 763, does not control our decision in this matter because it is inapt to the issues raised in this case. In Pizzi, the issue before this Court was whether Rule 6(d) extended the time frame for appealing an administrative decision by one day because the plaintiff received that decision by mail. Pizzi, 857 A.2d at 763. Here, we are asked only to decide whether Rule 6(a) should be employed to compute the allowable time, not to extend the allowable period for filing. Thus, we do not believe that the language of Pizzi, dicta though it may be, cuts across our conclusion.', 'Indeed, from a practical standpoint, because the Superior Court Clerk’s office is closed on weekends and holidays, the trial justice’s decision would have afforded the plaintiff only twenty-nine days within which to file her complaint. Section 42-35-15(b) says that a plaintiff is to be afforded thirty days. 7', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.

59,: v. : Omar Proctor et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, William Lamont Thomas, sustained injuries when he was shot by the defendant, Omar Proctor, an officer with the Providence Police Department. The plaintiff appeals from a judgment entered after a jury verdict in favor of the defendant in the plaintiff’s civil action seeking damages. The plaintiff asserts that he was unfairly prejudiced when the trial justice allowed the defendant to introduce into evidence a redacted police department database report. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The plaintiff, in his Rule 12A statement, additionally asserted that the trial justice erred by not allowing him to ask for numeric damages regarding the pain and suffering experienced by plaintiff; however, during oral argument, plaintiff conceded that this issue was moot in light of the jury verdict.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'At approximately 6 p.m. on December 20, 2004, defendant was patrolling the vicinity of Broad Street when he saw plaintiff in front of a video store. The defendant testified that he was aware that there was an outstanding warrant for plaintiff, and that, therefore, he requested assistance to arrest plaintiff. Shortly thereafter, Ptlm. Frank Newton arrived at the scene. After plaintiff exited the store and entered his vehicle, Ptlm. Newton walked toward the driver’s side of plaintiff’s car. The defendant also approached the vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and ordered plaintiff to step out of the vehicle. 2 The defendant testified that plaintiff had been “fumbling in his waistband,” which caused defendant to conduct a pat-down search for weapons. However, as defendant “approached the front area of [plaintiff’s] waistband area where he * * * was observed fumbling,” plaintiff “turned and pushed [defendant] down,” “back peddl[ed], fumbling in his waistband area,” and then “began running.”', 'The defendant testified that, when he got up, he unholstered his firearm because he thought plaintiff was armed and began chasing after him. The defendant testified that, while he was running, he observed plaintiff’s “hand c[o]me out and [he] believed [plaintiff] was going to fire at [him],” so he yelled, “Stop,” and “fire[d] a round,” but missed and plaintiff kept running. According to defendant, he heard something fall and subsequently picked up a handgun that he believed to be Ptlm. Newton’s. The defendant averred that plaintiff “was still fumbling in his waistband area as he was running.” 2', 'The plaintiff and Ptlm. Newton both testified that defendant pulled plaintiff out of his car; however, defendant denied this. In a statement plaintiff gave to the police the day after the shooting, however, he merely stated that he “stood out of the car.”', '-2-', 'The defendant further testified that he pursued plaintiff through several empty lots to Public Street, where plaintiff ran behind a house. As plaintiff emerged from the back yard, he encountered defendant in a driveway. According to defendant, he yelled at plaintiff to stop, but plaintiff continued toward him with his hands down. 3 In response to plaintiff’s advancement and defendant’s professed belief that plaintiff was armed, defendant made a “[s]plit second” decision and “fired one round center mass.” 4', 'Doctor Elizabeth Laposata, a forensic pathologist, testified regarding plaintiff’s injuries. She stated that the bullet had grazed the back of plaintiff’s right wrist, entered the left side of his sternum, tunneled under his skin and “contus[ed] the lung,” exited the space below his left rib, and then reentered his left upper arm in the triceps muscle, where it remained. The plaintiff testified that he remained in the hospital for three or four days following the shooting. He further attested that, at the time of the trial, he still had pain in his chest and his arm, that, “because of where the bullet is [lodged] in [his] arm, it’s hard to position [in] normal positions, just laying, sitting down, resting [his] arm,” and that he cannot lift heavy items without pain. The plaintiff also stated that he had been having nightmares, causing him to have trouble sleeping for six years since the event occurred.', 'On December 16, 2005, plaintiff filed a civil complaint against defendant in the Superior Court. 5 A jury trial commenced on January 11, 2011, after which the jury found that plaintiff did 3', 'The defendant admitted during the trial that the area was not well lit. The plaintiff testified that, when he saw defendant, he put his hands up in the air and said, “I’m giving up.” In plaintiff’s deposition, he stated: “After I was shot, I looked down at my chest. I seen the blood coming out. [The defendant was] yelling, ‘Get on the ground.’ He’s shaking. * * * I’m thinking he’s going to shoot me again.” 4', 'The defendant testified that officers are trained at the police academy to aim for “center mass,” which he described as “one of the largest target areas to aim for.” 5', 'The plaintiff also named Stephen Napolitano, in his capacity as the treasurer of the City of Providence, as a defendant.', '-3- not prove “by a fair preponderance of the evidence that * * * [defendant] acted unreasonably under the circumstances when he shot and injured [plaintiff],” and a verdict was entered in defendant’s favor. Subsequently, plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied after a hearing held on March 7, 2011. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on March 22, 2011. 6', 'Additional facts will be provided as may be necessary to discuss the issues raised on appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states that, even if evidence is considered relevant, it “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” “It is well settled that this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on an evidentiary issue unless that ruling constitutes an abuse of the justice’s discretion that prejudices the complaining party.” State v. Tetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Dellay, 687 A.2d 435, 439 (R.I. 1996)). This Court has said that “a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly,” and “[i]t is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008). 6', 'Judgment was not entered in this case until June 26, 2012. Although defendant filed his appeal on March 22, 2011, this Court will treat defendant’s premature appeal as timely. See Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011).', '-4-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The central issue at the trial was whether Officer Proctor acted reasonably when he shot Thomas. The defendant testified that, at the time of this incident, he “was aware that [plaintiff] had been charged with possession of a sawed off shotgun,” having acquired this information from the police database. Subsequently, the trial justice admitted into evidence a redacted version of plaintiff’s “Known Persons Intelligence Report” (report), the document from which defendant had received the database information. The report, as entered, included plaintiff’s basic biographical information, his mug shot, and a reference to his arrest for possession of a shotgun in 1992. All other references to his previous arrests were redacted, however.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by admitting the “picture of the [p]laintiff from the [p]olice department’s data base where it was written under his picture that * * * the [p]laintiff had been charged with carrying a sawed off shotgun” because “[t]his charge was ultimately dismissed,” and it “was highly prejudicial, outweighed its probative value, was too remote in time and was not a conviction.” The defendant counters that the report was introduced to show the jury that he believed his life was in jeopardy at the time of the shooting, that, therefore, his actions in shooting plaintiff were reasonable, and that, accordingly, the exhibit was not unfairly prejudicial.', 'During the direct examination of defendant, he was asked whether he was aware of any gun offenses with which plaintiff had been charged, to which he responded, “I was aware that he was charged with possession of a sawed off shotgun.” During cross-examination, plaintiff’s counsel questioned defendant, “You know, don’t you, that [plaintiff] was never convicted of that crime of carrying a gun?” to which he answered, “I didn’t know if he was ever convicted.” After', '-5- asking again and having defendant affirm his previous answer, plaintiff’s counsel requested that the report be marked for identification, to which defendant’s counsel objected unless it was going to be entered as a full exhibit. The following colloquy was held at sidebar:', '“THE COURT: Why can’t we put this in?', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: I’m not putting it in. I’m asking him', 'to identify it to see if there is anything that says he is convicted of', 'carrying a gun.', '“[Defendant’s Counsel]: Then it’s admitted for substantive', 'purposes as a full exhibit. The witness testified he didn’t do a', 'criminal history. He didn’t know until [plaintiff’s counsel] -- I', 'don’t know how he knows by way of a question. It’s in evidence', 'that he says, I didn’t know. He had not been convicted. So it’s in', 'as an exhibit or it’s not in. If it’s not in as an exhibit, the witness', 'can’t use it.', '“THE COURT: You can put into evidence that he wasn’t', 'convicted. It’s easy enough to mark it.', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: I understand that, your Honor. I’m', 'not going to put it in because it has more of a criminal record that', 'we talked about. That’s why, obviously, I don’t want to put it in.', 'When he says that he does not, he already said he admitted that', 'he’s known to carry a gun. Well, he’s never been convicted of', 'carrying a gun.', '“THE COURT: What was his knowledge at the time? So', 'the choice is either it gets admitted or it’s not asked.” The trial justice then sustained the objection, and the trial continued.', 'During the redirect examination of defendant, his counsel also requested that the report be marked for identification, to which plaintiff’s counsel objected:', '“[Defendant’s Counsel]: Now, you testified on direct', 'examination that at some point early on before you actually knew', '[plaintiff], you came across a photograph and information on him', 'in a police data base. Is that correct?', '“[Defendant]: That’s correct.', '“[Defendant’s Counsel]: May I have this marked for', 'identification?', '“* * *', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: I’m going to object, your Honor.', '“THE COURT: Okay.', '“[Defendant’s Counsel]: I haven’t moved it full.', '-6-', '“THE COURT: Can I just see the exhibit? Okay. Counsel', 'at this point can proceed. It’s marked for I.D. I will hear counsel’s', 'objection if it’s in fact going to be moved in for full.” Subsequently, defendant’s counsel requested that the report be marked as a full exhibit, to which plaintiff’s counsel objected, and the following exchange occurred at sidebar:', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: Your Honor, my objection,', 'obviously, is to the information of possession of cocaine,', 'possession of marijuana. Everything else on there we kept out and', 'the reason for that, obviously, and I never got into it. He got into', 'what he did and everything else. All I asked him was how did you', 'know him.

You can ask', 'him is that where you found possession of a shotgun on that.', '“THE COURT: Okay. The Court is convinced from the', 'cross-examination there was much more than just one question that', 'involved what he looked at prior. Also what he looked at prior', 'does go to what his reasonable belief was at the time. Therefore,', 'the Court, over counsel’s objection, is going to permit this to be', 'entered as an exhibit in full.', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: It’s not prejudicial, Judge?', '“THE COURT: Absolutely, but it’s all a balancing.” The redirect examination continued, after the conclusion of which the trial justice stated:', '“THE COURT: Based on the testimony on [the report],', 'what the Court will require is prior to that exhibit going to the jury', 'that the other pieces of it and the handgun portion be redacted.', 'The pictures can be there, everything else, and the Court will give', 'the jury later a curative instruction that they are not to take it one', 'way or another that there is blacked out spaces on that.', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: Thank you, your Honor.”', 'This Court has recognized that mug-shot photographs present a danger of unfair prejudice because they “generally indicate past criminal behavior and are likely to create in the minds of jurors an inference of criminal behavior.” State v. Dinagen, 639 A.2d 1353, 1356 (R.I. 1994).', '-7- Because of this inherent danger, we have, in the criminal law context, “adopted three criteria that a trial justice should consider prior to deciding to admit such photographs.” Id. These criteria “are intended as a basis upon which attorneys may argue for or against admission of the evidence, as well as a basis for the trial justice’s decision.” Id.', '“The three criteria are: ‘(1) the prosecution must have a', 'demonstrable need to introduce the photographs; (2) the', 'photographs themselves, if shown to the jury, must not imply that', 'defendant had a prior criminal record; and (3) the manner of', 'introduction at trial must be such that it does not draw particular', 'attention to the source or implications of the photographs.’” Id.', '(quoting State v. Lemon, 456 A.2d 261, 265 (R.I. 1983)).', 'Even if a mug-shot photograph is admitted erroneously, however, it does not constitute reversible error and “is not prejudicial when the state presents other competent evidence from which the jury could convict the defendant.” Dinagen, 639 A.2d at 1357. The admission of a mug shot “may be harmless if ‘it is not reasonably possible that such evidence would influence an average jury on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” Id. (quoting State v. Bowden, 439 A.2d 263, 269 (R.I. 1982)). Further, we have “generally held that when objectionable evidence also has come before the jury through other avenues, the improper admission of the evidence was not prejudicial.” State v. Robertson, 740 A.2d 330, 336 (R.I. 1999). In Dinagen, 639 A.2d at 1358, we held that, even if mug shots were impermissibly admitted because the jury could then infer prior criminal conduct, it is not fatal where evidence of the defendant’s prior convictions came before the jury in other ways.', 'We recognize that, in the case under review, the jury was tasked with weighing defendant’s civil liability rather than plaintiff’s criminal liability. Nevertheless, the introduction of mug-shot photographs clearly has the potential of unfairly tipping the scales of justice in favor of one party or the other. Here, the reasonableness of Officer Proctor’s action was at issue and', '-8- was determined by what he knew at the time of the shooting. Officer Proctor had already testified about Thomas’s previous arrest for possession of a shotgun, therefore, the mug shot did not inform the jury of something of which it was not already aware. This, in itself, eliminated the high level of prejudice that most mug-shot photographs carry when admitted. Moreover, this argument was not sufficiently articulated at trial.', 'After a thorough review of the record, and to the extent that the issue was properly preserved for appellate review, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s decision to admit the redacted report was well within his discretionary authority. 7 As the trial justice explained in his instructions to the jury, Officer Proctor’s knowledge at the time of the shooting regarding Thomas’s prior arrest for possession of a shotgun was relevant to the jury’s determination of “whether or not another reasonable police officer standing in the shoes of the defendant police officer confronted with the same circumstances and having the same information available to the defendant at the time of the incident would have acted in the same or similar fashion.”', 'The plaintiff’s contention that the report containing his mug shot and the arrest for possession of a shotgun was highly prejudicial and outweighed its probative value was properly considered by the trial justice. Not only does the record show that the trial justice determined that the report was indeed prejudicial, albeit not unfairly so, he ordered that the report be redacted to remove from the exhibit all references to the plaintiff’s arrests except for the possession of a shotgun charge. Indeed, the trial justice addressed the only objection to the report articulated by the plaintiff, viz., the inclusion in the report of the plaintiff’s arrests for possession of illegal substances. The plaintiff explicitly stated, “[M]y objection, obviously, is to 7', 'We note that the trial justice stated that he would provide the jury with a curative instruction regarding the “blacked out spaces” on the redacted report; however, it seems as though the report was redacted in such a way that it neither contained any black streaks nor made it apparent that there were other charges listed on the report.', '-9- the information of possession of cocaine, possession of marijuana.” Significantly, the plaintiff said that he had “no problem” if the defendant testified that the “database says [the plaintiff was] charged with a weapon.” Further, when the trial justice declared his final determination that the report would be redacted before being made available to the jury but that the photographs would remain, the plaintiff’s only response was, “Thank you, your Honor.” No protestations were made nor did the plaintiff suggest that the redactions did not satisfactorily address his objections. Moreover, we are satisfied from the trial justice’s comments that he appropriately balanced the probative value of the report against the danger of unfair prejudice. Thus, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s determination to admit the redacted report.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hold that the trial justice did not err in denying the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.

Furtado (Lucilio) and Patricia Goncalves (Patricia) 2 (collectively, plaintiffs), appeal from a Superior Court judgment ordering them to execute general releases and pay attorney’s fees incurred by the executrix in seeking to enforce the settlement agreement. The plaintiffs argue that the Superior Court erred in ordering them to execute general releases with terms that were materially different from those contemplated during settlement negotiations, and in assessing attorney’s fees under G.L. 1956 § 9-1-45. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further 1', 'Because many of the individuals involved in this case share a common surname, this opinion will refer to the various parties by their first names to maintain clarity.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2006, Alfredo executed a will that made no provision for two of his children, Lucilio and Patricia. After Alfredo’s death, Lucilio and Patricia contested probate of that will, alleging lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence, and noncompliance with required formalities. The Providence Probate Court admitted the will into probate and appointed Maria (another of Alfredo’s children) as executrix. Lucilio and Patricia appealed the Probate Court’s order to the Superior Court.', 'After the parties had conducted discovery, they participated in a mediation session facilitated by the Roger Williams University School of Law Mediation Clinic. After several hours of negotiations, the parties reached an agreement in principle, which was reduced to writing by the mediator. Drafts of the agreement were circulated to the parties, and a final settlement agreement was eventually signed by the parties.', 'Pursuant to that agreement, defendant was to convey certain real estate located in the City of Providence to each of the two plaintiffs. The agreement also specified that', '“4. Maria Goncalves’ obligation to convey the properties to Lucilio', 'P. Furtado and Patricia Goncalves as set forth above is conditioned', 'upon the following:', '“a. The delivery by Lucilio P.

The general releases required plaintiffs to release all claims related to Alfredo’s estate and assets, “whether such Claims arise, are brought or have a situs in the United States of America, the Republic of Cape Verde or anywhere else,” and to refrain from filing any future claims. The plaintiffs requested that the release language pertaining to claims in Cape Verde be removed from the general releases, asserting that they did not understand the settlement discussions to cover claims involving property that was neither included in the probate estate nor located in Rhode Island. 4 The defendant refused to delete the references to Cape Verde claims from the general releases, pointing to conversations that allegedly took place during the mediation session about the Cape Verde property to support her contention that the settlement negotiations (and resulting agreement) were understood by all of the parties to include the Cape Verde property. Having reached an impasse on the release language, defendant filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement in the Superior Court. 3', 'In various documents in the record, Lucilla’s name is alternatively spelled “Lucillia” and “Lucilia.” 4', 'The record indicates that the property in Cape Verde is real estate, but provides few other undisputed details about its location, value, characteristics, etc.', '-3-', 'On April 12, 2011, the trial justice heard arguments from both sides and reviewed several documents, including Alfredo’s will and a related trust instrument. 5 During the hearing, the parties’ attorneys made conflicting representations about the extent to which the Cape Verde property had been discussed during the mediation session. Although the trial justice initially suggested that an evidentiary hearing might be necessary, ultimately, one was not held. Based on her review of pertinent documents and representations by counsel, the trial justice concluded that the settlement agreement clearly and unambiguously covered real estate located in Cape Verde and directed the plaintiffs to execute the proposed general releases.', 'Following entry of an order to that effect, defendant moved to recover attorney’s fees in the amount of $2,805 for time spent seeking to enforce the settlement agreement. The plaintiffs objected. After hearing arguments on this issue on June 22, 2011, the trial justice found that the requested attorney’s fees were fair and reasonable, and concluded that defendant was entitled to reimbursement under § 9-1-45. 6 The trial justice also denied plaintiffs’ request for a stay pending appeal.', 'The plaintiffs appealed both the Superior Court’s order enforcing the mediated settlement agreement and the order awarding attorney’s fees. 7 5', 'In his will, Alfredo devised all of his real property to a trust that had been established in 1989.

In assessing whether contract language is ambiguous, “‘we give words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.’ * * * The subjective intent of the parties may not properly be considered by the Court; rather, we ‘consider the intent expressed by the language of the contract.’” Id. at 128 (quoting Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association v. Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 11 A.3d 1078, 1083-84 (R.I. 2010)).

We will address each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Order Enforcing Settlement Agreement', 'First, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred when she ordered them to execute the general releases proposed by defendant because “the terms of the General Release[s] substantially changed the content, meaning and effect of the Mediated Settlement Agreement, including language that so dramatically altered the terms of the agreement that it did not in any way represent the intention of the Appellants or of the parties.” In particular, plaintiffs assert that “[t]here is nothing in the will or trust which lists real properties in Cape Verde or in any jurisdiction outside the State of Rhode Island,” and claim that “with the exception of a few allusions in the general discussion during the mediation, that Cape Verde [property] was not a part of the settlement discussions, nor was a disposition of any real estate in Cape Verde anticipated as part of the settlement agreement between the parties hereto.” The defendant responds that the mediated settlement agreement’s reference to the “General Release” of “any and all claims” clearly and unambiguously covers any claims to property in Cape Verde (and everywhere else in the world), and urges that whatever plaintiffs’ subjective intent may have been at the time of execution is irrelevant.', '-6-', 'We treat settlement agreements as we would any other contract, binding the parties to the terms of their bargain and permitting signatories of settlement agreements to seek court assistance in enforcing those agreements when another party has reneged. See, e.g., Homar, Inc. v. North Farm Associates, 445 A.2d 288, 290 (R.I. 1982) (noting that “[s]ettlement of a disputed liability is as conclusive of the parties’ rights as is a judgment that terminates litigation between them,” and permitting a party to initiate a second action to enforce a settlement agreement reached in an earlier proceeding); see also Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Co. v. Star Equipment Corp., 541 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008) (“Where * * * the settlement collapses before the original suit is dismissed, the party seeking to enforce the agreement may file a motion with the trial court.”). Accordingly, we will apply general contract law principles in construing this mediated settlement agreement. We review a trial justice’s legal determinations—including whether a contract is ambiguous—de novo. See Derderian, 44 A.3d at 127.', 'Here, the parties met for the purpose of mediating disputes “arising between or among them regarding the administration of the Estate and Trust of Alfredo D. Goncalves.” The operative language in the settlement agreement provides that defendant’s delivery of deeds to plaintiffs was conditioned on plaintiffs’ execution of “General Releases, in form acceptable to counsel for the Estate of Alfredo D. Goncalves, that releases any and all claims that Lucilio P. Furtado and Patricia Goncalves have or may have against * * *: The Estate of Alfredo D. Goncalves, the Alfredo Goncalves Trust or Trusts, Maria Goncalves,” and Alfredo’s other children. (Emphasis added.) We perceive this language in the settlement agreement to clearly and unambiguously require precisely what it states, and no more: the “release[] [of] any and all claims” against defendant, Alfredo’s Estate and Trust, and the other children. In contrast to the initial settlement agreement, the proposed general releases provide that plaintiffs will release all', '-7- claims “whether such Claims arise, are brought or have a situs in the United States of America, the Republic of Cape Verde or anywhere else.” This reference in the general releases to claims in specific geographic regions goes beyond the plain and unambiguous meaning of the settlement agreement’s call for the release of “any and all claims.” Therefore, we hold that the general release’s language exceeds the clear and unambiguous terms of the settlement agreement because it utilizes language that specifically encompasses claims arising in Cape Verde rather than employing the more general language (“any and all”) that was contemplated by the settlement agreement. 8', 'B', 'Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees', 'We turn next to the Superior Court’s award of attorney’s fees pursuant to § 9-1-45, which permits a court to “award a reasonable attorney’s fee to the prevailing party in any civil action arising from a breach of contract” if the court “[f]inds that there was a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact raised by the losing party” or “[r]enders a default judgment against the losing party.” We have already held that the defendant was not entitled to a judgment requiring the plaintiffs to execute the proposed general releases because the language of the general releases did not mirror the clear and unambiguous terms of the settlement agreement. See Section III, A, supra. Thus, § 9-1-45’s threshold requirement—that the party to receive the attorney’s fee award be the “prevailing party”—has not been met, and we vacate the Superior Court’s award of attorney’s fees to the defendant. 8', 'We recognize that the distinction between the release of all claims that arise or “have a situs in the United States, the Republic of Cape Verde or anywhere else” may be one of form more than substance; nonetheless, the current controversy must be resolved in favor of the parties’ mediated settlement agreement.', '-8-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, we direct the Superior Court to order the defendant to fulfill her obligation to convey the specified properties to the plaintiffs upon the delivery by the plaintiffs of the general releases prepared by the defendant, which shall be amended to release “any and all claims,” but shall not contain any geographical reference.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Lucilio P.

This case, arising from allegations of employment discrimination, is before the Court on a writ of certiorari. The State of Rhode Island seeks review of the Superior Court’s denial of its motion to dismiss and denial of its motion for summary judgment. 1 The plaintiff, Dawn L. Huntley (plaintiff or Ms. Huntley), filed suit against the state alleging statutory claims under the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), and the Rhode Island Whistleblowers’ Protection Act (WPA). The state asserts that these claims should be barred by the doctrine of res judicata because Huntley previously had filed a nearly identical suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island (federal court), which action was dismissed by that court. Further, the state argues that Ms. Huntley’s amended complaint was not timely filed and, that, therefore the additional named defendants were not properly before the court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not summarily be decided. After 1', 'Although the state filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, the Superior Court order states “Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment is Denied.”', '-1- reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we are satisfied that the issues may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiff, Ms. Huntley, is a fifty-six-year-old African-American woman who was employed as a prosecutor by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General from 1999 until 2008. During this time, Ms. Huntley alleges that she was subjected to a pattern of discriminatory treatment, which included inappropriate and offensive remarks regarding her sex and race, as well as denial of promotion and raises. In 2006, Ms. Huntley filed an internal grievance, which was deemed unfounded. In July 2008, after returning from medical leave, Ms. Huntley was terminated from her position. In November 2008, she filed a charge of discrimination with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (the commission) and, two years later, on November 3, 2010, received a notice of right to sue (notice letter) from that agency. The notice letter provided that the right to sue would be lost unless Ms. Huntley filed suit within ninety days from the date of the notice.', 'On April 30, 2010, prior to receiving the notice letter, Ms. Huntley filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office, specifically naming Deputy Attorney General Gerald Coyne, Chief of the Criminal Division Alan Goulart, and others. Four months later, she amended the complaint to omit the majority of the individually named employees of the Office of the Attorney General, leaving as defendants the “State of Rhode Island, Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office, Patrick Lynch, individually, and in their professional capacity.” The said', '-2- defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing that (1) Ms. Huntley was not an employee under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (2) she did not sufficiently allege discrimination because of her age, race, or gender, (3) Title VII does not apply to claims of age discrimination, (4) she did not plead adequate grounds for a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, and (5) the federal court should decline to address state law claims because workers’ compensation is the exclusive remedy for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress and defendants were immune from suit for breach of contract. Ms. Huntley filed no objection. Subsequently, the complaint was dismissed on October 4, 2010. The judgment states that “[j]udgment is hereby entered for the defendants, State of Rhode Island, Patrick Lynch and the RI Attorney General’s Office, against the plaintiff, Dawn L. Huntley, pursuant to the Order dated October 4, 2010 [granting] Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.” 2', 'There is nothing in the judgment or order indicating whether the dismissal was made with or without prejudice.', 'On January 31, 2011, after receiving the right to sue letter from the commission, Ms. Huntley, now represented by counsel, filed suit in the Superior Court, naming the state of Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General as defendant and asserting claims under the FEPA, the RICRA, and the WPA. On March 24, 2011, Ms. Huntley amended that complaint to add defendants Lincoln Chafee, Peter Kilmartin, Gina Raimondo, Patrick Lynch, Gerald Coyne, and Alan Goulart. 3 2', 'The judgment of the federal court was submitted with this appeal. Although the judgment states “pursuant to the Order dated October 4, 2010,” no copy of the order was supplied to the Superior Court. Following oral arguments before this Court, the state supplemented the record with a copy of the federal court order which states, “This matter is before the [c]ourt on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the Motion and the time for doing so has passed. The [c]ourt, therefore, GRANTS the Motion to Dismiss.” 3', 'The additional defendants were sued in their official capacities, Lincoln Chafee as Governor, Peter Kilmartin as Attorney General, and Gina Raimondo as General Treasurer.', '-3-', 'On July 11, 2011, the state filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Ms. Huntley’s action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because final judgment had entered against Ms. Huntley in her federal suit on essentially the same claims. Further, the state argued that the claims against Coyne and Goulart were time- barred because the amended complaint was filed after the ninety-day period allowed by the notice letter. In opposing the motion, Ms. Huntley argued, inter alia, that the federal court dismissal was not “on the merits,” but rather due to a lack of jurisdiction, and thus did not bar her state court action. Ms. Huntley further asserted that the addition of Coyne and Goulart was timely because her amended complaint related back to the date of her initial complaint. Further, Ms. Huntley noted that her claims brought under the RICRA and the WPA are not subject to the ninety-day period and, thus, were timely.', 'A Superior Court hearing on the state’s motion was held on September 13, 2011. At that time, Ms. Huntley requested that, if the hearing justice treated the motion as a motion for summary judgment, she be afforded the opportunity to present affidavits. The hearing justice stated that, for the purposes of oral argument, she would treat the motion as a motion to dismiss. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing justice gave the parties an opportunity to submit further briefs and materials. On November 9, 2011, the hearing justice issued a written decision holding that the state “fail[ed] to prove that [the] prior judgment was final or that it was dismissed with prejudice.” The hearing justice found that, even assuming that the federal court claims were dismissed on the grounds argued in the state’s memorandum of law in support of its federal court motion to dismiss, “such judgment did not go to the merits of the action and will not bar the instant action.” Finally, the court held that the amended complaint related back to the', '-4- date of the original complaint, and, thus, Coyne and Goulart were timely added as defendants. The court denied both the motion to dismiss and the motion for summary judgment.', 'The state filed a petition for writ of certiorari on December 7, 2011, and, on February 20, 2012, this Court granted that petition. At that time, the Court directed the parties to address both the issue of res judicata and the appropriateness of the Superior Court’s ruling that the amended complaint related back to the date of the original complaint with respect to the additional defendants.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court’s review ‘on writ of certiorari is limited to examining the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” State v.

Further, the state asserts that the amended complaint should not relate back to the date of the original complaint because Ms. Huntley’s omission of two defendants was not a mistake, but rather was a tactical decision.', 'Ms. Huntley argues that the federal claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, which is not a judgment on the merits and thus res judicata does not apply to bar her claims. Further, she asserts that the amended complaint should relate back to the date of the original complaint because she filed the amendment prior to any responsive pleading. Additionally, Ms. Huntley argues that relation back is not relevant to either the RICRA claim or the WPA claim, as those actions have a three-year statute of limitations.', 'The doctrine of res judicata bars the relitigation of all issues that “were tried or might have been tried” in an earlier action. Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1027 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Carrozza v. Voccola, 962 A.2d 73, 78 (R.I. 2009)). “In essence, the doctrine * * * ‘serves as an absolute bar to a second cause of action where there exists identity of parties, identity of issues, and finality of judgment in an earlier action.’” Id.

Here, where defendants are all members of state government or employees of the Attorney General’s office, they are clearly in privity with the named defendant State of Rhode Island.', 'Identity of issues is established where “all claims arising from the same transaction or series of transactions which could have properly been raised in a previous litigation” are present in the latter suit. DiBattista v. State, 808 A.2d 1081, 1086 (R.I. 2002). Here, the facts underlying Huntley’s claims are the same as those underlying her federal complaint. Accordingly, we will focus our analysis on the dispositive issue—whether the federal court dismissal operates as a final judgment on the merits.', 'The burden is upon the party asserting res judicata to “prove that the prior judgment on which it is relying was final.” 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 648 at 222 (2006).

Accordingly, defendants’ motion was granted. Further, Ms. Huntley did not appeal the dismissal.', '“The principle underlying the rule of [res judicata] * * * is that a party who once has had a chance to litigate a claim before an appropriate tribunal usually ought not to have another chance to do so.” Restatement (Second) Judgments ch. 1 at 2 (1982).

Freer', 'Introduction to Civil Procedure § 11.1 at 512 (2006). Ms. Huntley argues that the dismissal should not be given preclusive effect because the merits of her claim were not reached. However, the plain language of Rule 41(b) does not require that the merits of a claim be reached in order for a dismissal to “operate[] as an adjudication on the merits.” Instead, what is required is that the party had an opportunity to be heard. “[A]s long as a prior federal court judgment is procured in a manner that satisfies due process concerns, the requisite ‘full and fair opportunity’ existed.” Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, Inc. v.

However, the order states clearly that “[p]laintiff has not filed an opposition to the [m]otion and the time for doing so has passed. The [c]ourt, therefore, [grants] the [m]otion to [d]ismiss.” “Ordinarily, a dismissal for failure to state a claim is treated as a dismissal on the merits, and there is abundant case law to this effect.” AVX Corp. v.

To support this argument, plaintiff offers the docket of an unrelated case in which it appears that a magistrate in the federal court gave a party notice of a pending, unanswered motion to dismiss.5 However, it does not follow that because a judicial officer in another case chose to give particularized notice to a party, a judgment issued without such notice is void. Although a court may choose to give additional notice as a courtesy, the court’s local rule requiring the filing of an objection within fourteen days after service of a motion provides all the notice that is required.', 'Accordingly, because we find identity of the parties, identity of the issues, and finality of judgment, we hold that the federal court judgment is entitled to preclusive effect.

Finally, defendant argues that because safety glass was not required by the building code in effect at the time the school was constructed and indeed is not required by the present building code, the fact that the glass in the bathroom window was not safety glass is not evidence of a breach of duty. Accordingly, defendant asserts that the hearing justice was correct in granting its motion for summary judgment.', 'A', 'Duty to Supervise', '“It is well settled that to prevail on a claim of negligence ‘a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.’” Habershaw v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1276 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009)). The plaintiff argues that defendant’s duty is established both by G.L. 1956 § 16-2-17 and by the school’s handbook.', 'Section 16-2-17(a) states that students have “a right to attend * * * a school which is safe and secure, and which is conducive to learning, and which is free from the threat, actual or implied, of physical harm by a disruptive student.” However, we consider the argument based on § 16-2-17 to be meritless—since that statute clearly does not relate to non-public schools such as Bishop Hendricken High School.', 'The Bishop Hendricken Student Handbook provides that:', '“Designated supervisors of extracurricular activities are on duty for', 'necessary times before, during, and after their respective activities.', '-4-', '“Parents can expect the official supervision of students during the', 'school day to begin at 7:15 AM until 4:30 PM. The time of', 'official supervision of students during extracurricular activities', 'begins at the moment when the first student arrives for the activity', 'until such time as all students have departed. After school,', 'students are limited to the cafeteria and the foyer area * * *.', 'Outside these times of official supervision, students who are on', 'campus must observe policies, regulations and procedures', 'governing our school community.', '“Parents should be aware that the school will not be responsible for', 'students on campus outside times of official supervision.”', 'Daniels stated that he remained on campus to work out, as part of the school’s hockey program, and that, after working out, was on his way to the cafeteria when he ran into Goudiably. The evidence does not indicate whether the workout was a formal extracurricular activity as opposed to an individual pursuit tangentially linked to the hockey team.', 'The questions of whether Daniels was participating in an extracurricular activity, and whether that activity had ended are questions of material fact. However, the hearing justice assumed without deciding that a duty existed. This is consistent with the summary judgment standard of viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here, plaintiff. See Great American E & S Insurance Co., 45 A.3d at 574. For purposes of our review, this Court will likewise assume without deciding that a duty existed.', 'Determining whether the school breached its duty by failing to adequately supervise the boys at the time of the incident requires us to determine the extent of supervision necessary in a high school setting. This Court addressed this issue in Medeiros v. Sitrin, 984 A.2d 620, 626-27 (R.I. 2009). 3 In that case, a high school student was arriving late to class when he was injured by two other students in an altercation that took place in a lab area just outside of the classroom. Id. 3', 'As in the instant case, in Medeiros v. Sitrin, 984 A.2d 620, 626 (R.I. 2009), this Court stated, “for the purposes of this appeal, we will assume, without deciding, that [the defendant] had a duty to supervise [the students] * * *.”', '-5- at 623. The injured student filed suit against the teacher and the city, alleging that the teacher failed to adequately supervise “foreseeably late students who would have to travel through the lab to reach the classroom.” Id. at 624. However, because the plaintiff failed to identify “a specific act or omission * * * that indicated a deviation from the proper standard of care,” we held that the defendants did not breach their supervisory duties. Id. at 626 (quoting Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 732 (R.I. 2006)). We noted that “even the case law from other jurisdictions * * * cite[d] to support the proposed standard of care for teachers in supervising their students does not contemplate that a teacher’s physical absence from a student is necessarily a breach of the duty to supervise.” Id. at 627.', 'Here, plaintiff offers no specific act or omission by defendant other than the fact that no teacher or administrator was present to discourage or detect the horseplay. Absent a specific act or omission, we are reluctant to impose upon schools a standard that would require them to post monitors at each bathroom during after-school hours. We note that other jurisdictions have held that “schools are not the insurers of the safety of their students, ‘perfection in supervision’ is not required, and schools are not liable for ‘every thoughtless or careless act by which one pupil may injure another.’” Armellino v. Thomase, 899 N.Y.S.2d 339, 340 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010) (quoting Lawes v. Board of Education of the City of New York, 213 N.E.2d 667, 668-69 (N.Y. 1965)).', 'In determining the degree of supervision required, other jurisdictions have focused on the foreseeability of the injury. In Miller v. Yoshimoto, 536 P.2d 1195, 1198, 1200-01 (Haw. 1975), the Hawaii Supreme Court held that a school was not liable for injuries sustained by a student who was hit by rocks thrown by another child in an area between two campus buildings. The incident occurred just after the school day ended, as the children were walking home. Id. at 1196, 1198. There was no supervision of that area of the campus at the time of the incident. Id.', '-6- at 1200. The court held that the absence of “personnel assigned specifically to supervise the area in which [the student] was injured” was not sufficient to show a breach of the duty of reasonable supervision. Id. Rather, the Hawaii court looked to the foreseeability of the injury:', '“The duty of reasonable supervision does not require the', '[school] to provide personnel to supervise every portion of the', 'school buildings and campus area. However, if certain specific', 'areas are known to the [school] as dangerous, or the [school]', 'should have known that a specific area is dangerous, or the', '[school] knew or should have known that certain students would or', 'may conduct themselves in a manner dangerous to the welfare of', 'others, [the] duty of reasonable supervision would require specific', 'supervision of those situations.” Id.', 'More recently, a New York court employed a similar standard, holding that, in order to find that a school breached its duty to supervise, a plaintiff must show that the acts of the defendant students were foreseeable: “[T]o find that a school breached the duty to provide adequate supervision ‘in the context of injuries caused by the acts of fellow students,’ it must be demonstrated * * * ‘that the third-party acts could reasonably have been anticipated.’” Rose v. Onteora Central School District, 861 N.Y.S.2d 442, 443 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008) (quoting Mirand v. City of New York, 637 N.E.2d 263, 266 (N.Y. 1994)). In Rose, 861 N.Y.S.2d at 443, the plaintiff student was injured when a fellow student, as a prank, closed a classroom door on his hand. The plaintiff student sued the school district, alleging negligent supervision. Id. In holding that the school was not liable, the court noted that the incident was not reasonably foreseeable because there was no history of disciplinary problems in the classroom where the incident took place, nor was there a history of disciplinary problems among the students involved. Id. at 444. The court noted that “constant supervision of students at the high school level is not required” and concluded that the incident “was the result of a spontaneous and', '-7- careless prank among high school friends such that [the] defendant could not have reasonably anticipated its occurrence or prevented it.” Id. at 443, 444.', 'We agree that, rather than hold schools to the standard of being insurers of their students’ safety, a plaintiff seeking to hold a school liable for injuries resulting from the acts of another student must show that such acts could have been reasonably foreseen by the school. Here, plaintiff offered no evidence that there was a history of “horseplay” in the area where the incident took place. 4 Nor was there any evidence offered that complaints had been made about Fluette’s conduct. Absent even the allegation of such a history, it was not error for the hearing justice to grant summary judgment for defendant, as plaintiff has not proven the existence of a disputed issue of material fact.', 'B', 'Safety Glass', 'Alternatively, plaintiff argues that the school had a duty to protect its students and that its failure to install safety glass in the boys’ bathroom window was a breach of that duty. Further, plaintiff asserts that the school’s reliance on its compliance with past and present building codes provides no defense to its negligence. In support of this argument, plaintiff offers several cases in which courts have held that failure to install safety glass in heavily used doors may be the basis of liability, notwithstanding the fact that safety glass was not required by the building codes. See Johnson v. City of Boston, 490 N.E.2d 1204, 1205, 1206 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986) (holding that the plaintiff had proven that a swinging door to the auditorium, used by students who were likely to be “high spirited” or “distracted,” was a “recognizable hazard,” despite the fact that the building code did not require the replacement of the door panel with safety glass); 4', 'Only if there were some evidence of such a history could the issue be beyond summary judgment and subject to a determination by the trier of fact.', '-8- Trimarco v. Klein, 436 N.E.2d 502, 503, 506 (N.Y. 1982) (holding that the evidence of custom and usage of installing shatterproof glass in shower doors was sufficient to establish a question of fact as to whether reasonable prudence required a landlord to replace the existing plain glass door); Wheeler v. Jones, 431 P.2d 985, 988, 989 (Utah 1967) (affirming a jury verdict against a defendant who failed to install safety glass in a sliding door to a pool area used exclusively by children).', 'The plaintiff’s reliance on these “door cases” is misplaced. In each of these cases, the hazard was quite foreseeable. In Johnson, 490 N.E.2d at 1205, 1206, the swinging door was located in a high traffic location, and the pane of glass was situated such that the plaintiff, in pushing the door, inadvertently put his hand through the glass. The glass at issue in Trimarco, 436 N.E.2d at 503, 504, was in a bathtub enclosure, long after the danger posed by using non- shatterproof glass in bath enclosures was recognized.', 'Similarly, the sliding glass door in Wheeler, 431 P.2d at 988, was used by children as the entrance to a swimming pool, and the hazard posed by the glass was readily apparent. By contrast, in this case there was no evidence submitted that the window in the boys’ bathroom received heavy use or that it was situated in such a way as to pose a particular danger. On the contrary, defendants offered an affidavit that stated that the glass in that window had not been replaced since the school was built in 1959. Unlike the “door cases,” here plaintiff presented no evidence at all that would tend to show that it was foreseeable that a student could be injured as a result of the school’s failure to install safety glass.', 'While compliance with building codes alone may not provide a complete defense, the school had no reason to foresee that the window might pose a danger, and imposing liability here', '-9- would be tantamount to making the school an insurer of its students. Accordingly, we find no error with the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

63,: v. : Juan G. Catala. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. It is said that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas— except in this case, where the parties dispute what happened there. The defendant, Juan G. Catala (Catala or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court money-damage judgment in favor of the plaintiff, David S. Vogel (Vogel or plaintiff). On appeal, Catala contends that the trial justice erred in (1) finding Vogel to be a credible witness; and (2) failing to find that the transaction between Vogel and Catala was void pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-19-17 as a loan for betting. This case came before us for oral argument on February 6, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the record and considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Initially, we pause to note that Catala, as the appealing party, has failed to order a transcript of the bench trial below, which is ultimately fatal to his appeal. 1 We briefly turn to the facts of this case, as gleaned from the record, including the written decision of the trial justice.', 'On April 9, 2007, Catala, while visiting Las Vegas, Nevada, called his friend, Vogel, who was in Rhode Island. Catala informed Vogel that he had lost money gambling and consequently needed additional money so he could attempt to recover his losses. Vogel then wired $8,500 to Catala, c/o The Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. According to Vogel, Catala promised to repay this debt within two weeks of receipt.', 'After Catala failed to repay him, on October 18, 2007, Vogel filed a complaint against Catala in Providence County Superior Court alleging both breach of contract and breach of an implied-in-fact contract. That same day, Vogel amended his complaint to include a claim for failure to repay based on book account. In his answer, Catala indicated that he was without sufficient information to admit or deny the book account claim—thus, disputing that he had received the $8,500. 2 He also denied the two breach-of-contract claims. 1', 'At oral argument, this Court asked Catala’s counsel whether he had ordered the transcript on appeal, to which he answered in the affirmative. However, our review of the lower court record reveals that he did not order the transcript—in fact, on the notice of appeal, he affirmatively indicated that the transcript would not be ordered.', 'On January 10, 2013, Vogel moved to dismiss this appeal on the grounds that Catala had failed to order a transcript of the proceedings below, pursuant to Article I, Rule 10 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. In light of this opinion, we need not address that motion. 2', 'Thereafter, in an affidavit filed on August 31, 2009, he acknowledged receipt of the $8,500.', '-2-', 'On April 23, 2009, Vogel moved for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit containing the same assertions he had previously made in his complaint. In this affidavit, Vogel stated, in pertinent part: “Defendant called me to request that I loan money to him[.] Defendant said that he had lost a substantial sum of money during his trip to Las Vegas, and needed to borrow money so that he might win back at least part of what he had lost.” On February 8, 2010, Catala then amended his answer to include an affirmative defense that the loan was void pursuant to § 11-19-17. 3', 'The hearing justice subsequently denied Vogel’s motion for summary judgment on February 23, 2010. Approximately one month later, Catala then moved for summary judgment, relying on the affirmative defense that he had raised in his amended answer that the loan at issue was void under § 11-19-17. The hearing justice denied this motion on May 18, 2010.', 'On November 4, 2010, the case proceeded to trial before another justice of the Superior Court, sitting without a jury. The trial justice issued a written decision on May 19, 2011, concluding that the loan was not void because it did not contravene § 11-19-17.', 'In so concluding, he found that Vogel’s testimony was more credible than that offered by Catala. In making this determination, the trial justice found “no credible evidence to support a finding that there were any promises given or made for the repayment of money knowingly lent for gambling or betting in violation of § 11-19-17.” He further found that “the monetary transaction between 3', 'In pertinent part, G.L. 1956 § 11-19-17 states that “[a]ll * * * promises, given or made * * * for the repayment of money knowingly lent for * * * betting, shall be utterly void.” Although this Court has not yet passed on the prohibitions contained within that statute, we reviewed an earlier version in McGrath v. Kennedy, 15 R.I. 209, 2 A. 438, (1886). There, reviewing R.I. Pub. St. ch. 246, § 16, we explained that “[a]ll bonds, notes, judgments, mortgages, deeds, or other securities, as well as promises, given or made for money, * * * won at any game, or by betting at any race or fight, * * * shall be utterly void.” Id. at 211, 2A. at 439 (emphasis added). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the first reported opinion issued by this Court declared a contract void where the parties had placed bets on the outcome of an election. Stoddard v. Martin, 1 R.I. 1, 6- 7 (1828).', '-3- the parties constituted a loan not tied to the gambling fortunes of Catala, and for which Vogel expected repayment * * *.” Thus, he concluded that the loan did not violate § 11-19-17 because it was not extended for gambling purposes; rather, it was extended as an ordinary loan with the understanding that it would be repaid. 4 “To conclude otherwise,” the trial justice stated, “would permit Catala to avoid repaying this loan, thus resulting in unjust enrichment.” Accordingly, Catala was ordered to pay damages to Vogel in the amount of $8,500, together with statutory interest and costs. A judgment to that effect entered on April 30, 2012.', 'Catala then appealed to this Court. 5 He advances two theories in support of his appeal. First, he contends that the trial justice was incorrect in finding that Vogel was a credible witness. Second, he argues that the trial justice erred in failing to find that the transaction was void pursuant to § 11-19-17, because, according to Catala, Vogel had advanced the money to him with the knowledge that it would be used for gambling. In countering Catala’s contentions on appeal, Vogel maintains that the trial justice was correct in concluding that he had loaned the money to Catala with the understanding that it would be repaid, and not with any knowledge that the loaned money would be used for gambling purposes', 'II', 'Analysis', '“This Court gives great weight to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil matter, and we will not disturb such findings unless they are ‘clearly erroneous or 4', 'The trial justice made this finding despite the allegation in Vogel’s complaint stating that he had wired Catala $8,500 after Catala told him that he “had lost a substantial sum of money during his trip [to Las Vegas], and now needed to borrow money so that he might win back at least part of what he had lost.” 5', 'Although Catala’s appeal of the trial justice’s decision was premature, the later entry of final judgment cured the defect in his premature appeal. See Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Dufault, 958 A.2d 620, 623 n.4 (R.I. 2008).', '-4- unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.’” Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 86 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Costa v. Silva, 996 A.2d 607, 611 (R.I. 2010)). Moreover, “[t]he task of determining the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly the function of the trial justice when sitting without a jury.” Walton v. Baird, 433 A.2d 963, 964 (R.I. 1981). “If our review of the record before us ‘indicates that competent evidence supports the [trial] justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.’” Thibaudeau v. Thibaudeau, 947 A.2d 243, 246 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Imperial Casualty and Indemnity Co. v. Bellini, 888 A.2d 957, 961 (R.I. 2005)).', 'Here, however, because we have not been provided with a transcript of the trial below, we are unable to properly engage in a review of the trial justice’s factual findings. Pursuant to Article I, Rules 10(b) and 11(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, Catala, as the appellant, had a duty to ensure that the record on appeal was “complete and ready for transmission” to this Court. Small Business Loan Fund Corp. v. Gallant, 795 A.2d 531, 532 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Procopio v. PRM Concrete Corp., 711 A.2d 650, 651 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). Catala’s failure to order the transcript is not only “risky business” but also fatal to his appeal. See Bergquist v. Cesario, 844 A.2d 100, 105 (R.I. 2004). “[W]e ordinarily will not decide matters presented to us unless there has * * * been transmitted to us so much of the record of the tribunal below as may be necessary to enable us to pass on the question at issue * * *.” Savoy Realty Corp. v. LPL, Inc., 121 R.I. 962, 962, 401 A.2d 61, 61 (1979) (mem.).', 'While the dissent reasons that Vogel’s judicial admissions allow us to engage in a meaningful review of the decision below, we conclude otherwise. Without the transcript, we can only speculate as to the testimony adduced at trial. This Court declines to accept such an', '-5- invitation to gamble in that regard. We acknowledge that Vogel pleaded that he had wired Catala $8,500 after Catala had told him that he “had lost a substantial sum of money during his trip [to Las Vegas], and now needed to borrow money so that he might win back at least part of what he had lost.” However, § 11-19-17 declares void only those transactions where money was “knowingly lent” for the purpose of, among other things, betting. (Emphasis added.) Thus, whether Vogel lent this money “knowingly” under § 11-19-17 was a question of fact for the trial justice in this case—a question that we cannot say the trial justice erred in deciding, without reviewing the transcript. Indeed, in his written decision, the trial justice explicitly found that “the monetary transaction between the parties constituted a loan not tied to the gambling fortunes of Catala, and for which Vogel expected repayment * * *.”', 'Because we are unable to engage in any meaningful review of the trial justice’s factual determination that Vogel did not “knowingly” lend the money at issue in contravention of § 11- 19-17, this Court “has no choice but to uphold the lower court’s findings.” See Bergquist, 844 A.2d at 105 (citing State v. Pineda, 712 A.2d 858, 861 (R.I. 1998)).', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Mr. Vogel, by virtue of his own explicit judicial admissions, was statutorily barred from recovering the sum of money at issue in this case.', '-6-', 'The following facts are uncontested.', 'And, in my judgment, these facts should be dispositive of this case.', 'Paragraph 7 of Mr. Vogel’s amended complaint reads in its entirety as follows:', '“On or about April 9, 2007, Defendant called Mr. Vogel in', 'order to request that Mr. Vogel lend money to Defendant. At that', 'time, Defendant was on vacation in Las Vegas, Nevada.', 'Defendant said that he (Defendant) had lost a substantial sum of', 'money during his trip, and now needed to borrow money so that he', 'might win back at least part of what he had lost. Defendant', 'indicated he would repay Mr. Vogel after he returned from Las', 'Vegas. On or about that same day (April 9, 2007), Mr. Vogel', 'wired $8,500 to Defendant; Defendant received the money at', 'Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas.” (Emphasis added.) Mr. Catala raised G.L. 1956 § 11-19-17 as an affirmative defense in his answer to the amended complaint. That statute provides, in unequivocal language, that “[a]ll * * * promises * * * for the repayment of money knowingly lent for * * * gaming or betting * * * shall be utterly void.” 6 Section 11-19-17 (emphasis added). Mr. Vogel also filed a motion for summary judgment, which included his sworn affidavit that acknowledged the purpose of the loan to Mr. Catala. Specifically, paragraph 4 of the affidavit states:', '“At the time [Mr. Catala] called me to request that I loan money to', 'him, [Mr. Catala] said that he had lost a substantial sum of money', 'during his trip to Las Vegas, and needed to borrow money so that', 'he might win back at least part of what he had lost.” (Emphasis', 'added.) Mr. Catala then filed his own motion for summary judgment, arguing that § 11-19-17 precluded Mr. Vogel from recovering the $8,500 at issue. In that motion, Mr. Catala directed the trial court’s attention to both paragraph 7 of the amended complaint and paragraph 4 of Mr. Vogel’s affidavit; nevertheless, the trial court denied Mr. Catala’s motion for summary judgment. The 6', 'The legislative ancestor of G.L. 1956 § 11-19-17 is the Statute of Queen Anne (9 Anne, ch.14, § 1), which was enacted in England in 1710. See 71 Am. Jur. 3d Proof of Facts 193 § 2 (2003).', '-7- case then proceeded to trial, at the conclusion of which the trial justice found that there was “no credible evidence to support a finding that there were any promises given or made for the repayment of money knowingly lent for gambling or betting in violation of § 11-19-17.”', 'The doctrine of “judicial admissions” has long been recognized in our case law. This Court has clearly stated that “parties to an action are judicially bound by their pleadings therein and * * * the allegations are conclusive as against the pleader.” Ogden v. Rabinowitz, 86 R.I. 294, 300, 134 A.2d 416, 419 (1957) (emphasis added).

The record before us contains (inter alia) Mr. Vogel’s amended complaint and Mr. Catala’s motion for summary judgment.', 'Mr. Vogel’s admission is dispositive of this case—a case that never should have gone to trial. In his amended complaint, Mr. Vogel explicitly indicated the purpose of the loan at issue; that pleading states that Mr. Vogel lent the disputed sum to Mr. Catala “so that he might win back at least part of what he had lost.” (Emphasis added.)', '-9-', 'The “fit” between the plaintiff’s two explicit statements as to the purpose of the loan and what § 11-19-17 addresses could hardly be more perfect. Section 11-19-17 reads:', '“All bonds, notes, judgments, mortgages, deeds or other securities,', 'as well as promises, given or made for money, lands, houses, or', 'other property, or article or piece of property, real, personal, or', 'mixed, won at any game, or by betting at any race or fight, or for', 'the repayment of money knowingly lent for such gaming or', 'betting, shall be utterly void.” (Emphasis added.) By its plain terms, the statute renders “utterly void” any loan where the lender knew that the borrower would use the loan to gamble. And that is precisely what Mr. Vogel admitted in his amended complaint and in his sworn affidavit: in both of those documents filed with the court, he stated that he knew (1) that Mr. Catala was in Las Vegas, (2) that Mr. Catala “had lost a substantial sum of money during his trip,” and (3) that Mr. Catala wanted the loan “so that he might win back at least part of what he had lost.” 7 7', 'It appears that the trial justice may have misunderstood the effect of § 11-19-17. In his decision, he included the following finding of fact:', '“Previously, Vogel did advance money to facilitate Catala’s entry', 'into tournament poker games. On those occasions, it was agreed', 'that the advance for entry fees would not be repaid by Catala', 'unless Catala won money in the poker tournament. The Court does', 'not find that the $8500 advance to Catala was in furtherance of the', 'above poker arrangements; instead, the $8500 was a loan made by', 'Vogel to Catala, and for which Catala was obligated to repay', 'regardless of how he used the money.” This finding by the trial justice suggests that he believed that § 11-19-17 would apply only if Mr. Vogel’s repayment was conditioned on Mr. Catala winning money at the tables. The statute, however, is broader than that; it applies if money is “knowingly lent for * * * gaming or betting.” In other words, since Mr. Vogel knew that Mr. Catala would be gambling with the $8,500, Mr. Catala was statutorily absolved of any legal obligation to pay Mr. Vogel back. This may be a severe result, but it is the result expressly mandated by the General Assembly in § 11-19-17. The statute applies whether or not the lender has a stake in the outcome; so long as the lender offers money that he or she knows will be used to gamble, there is no legally enforceable promise for repayment.', '- 10 -', 'Mr. Catala expressly cited the statute as an affirmative defense in his answer to the amended complaint, and he thereafter brought his statutory defense and Mr. Vogel’s judicial admission (and affidavit) to the court’s attention when he moved (unsuccessfully) for summary judgment. At the time Mr. Vogel filed his amended complaint, Mr. Vogel’s knowledge of the purpose of the loan was “conclusively established.” See State v. Rice, 986 A.2d 247, 249 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, Mr. Vogel was “preclude[d] * * * from challenging [the judicially admitted fact] later during the lawsuit * * *.” See DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 767 (R.I. 2000). In spite of Mr. Vogel’s written judicial admission, the trial court denied Mr. Catala’s motion for summary judgment, proceeded to conduct a trial, and ultimately rendered a verdict that belied the statements made in Mr. Vogel’s amended complaint and affidavit.', 'This case should have been decided by the granting of summary judgment in Mr. Catala’s favor. What transpired after the denial of Mr. Catala’s motion for summary judgment was entirely unnecessary. The trial justice never should have heard testimony or made credibility determinations. The transcript is superfluous to this appeal because, no matter what evidence was presented, the judicial admission in the amended complaint was conclusively established as against Mr. Vogel. See Rice, 986 A.2d at 249.', 'The majority states that, “[w]ithout the transcript, [they] can only speculate as to the testimony adduced at trial”; therefore, they “decline[] to accept such an invitation to gamble in that regard.” Our law on judicial admissions, however, makes it clear that, in this case, there is no gamble: “A party cannot take a position contradictory of, or inconsistent with, his pleadings * * *.” See Ogden, 86 R.I. at 300, 134 A.2d at 419. Whether Mr. Vogel lent the money “knowingly” for the purpose of betting is surely a question of fact, but Mr. Vogel answered that', '- 11 - factual inquiry “conclusively” when he filed his amended complaint. See Rice, 986 A.2d at 249. The trial justice’s findings, however, contradict a fact that had already been “conclusively established.” See id. Mr. Vogel could very well have called one hundred witnesses to testify that he lent Mr. Catala the money without knowing that he would use it to gamble, but all of such testimony would have been to no avail in view of Mr. Vogel’s unambiguous judicial admission. See 29A Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 783 (2008) (“The party who made a judicial admission may not controvert the admission on trial or on appeal, and may not create a question of fact for purposes of a summary judgment motion by trying to contradict a previous judicial admission.”). While I have great respect for my colleagues in the majority, it is unclear to me why they have not addressed the conclusive nature of Mr. Vogel’s judicial admission—a concept which we have characterized as “among the most solemn and probative evidentiary offerings known to the law.” See Carter v. Munson, 452 A.2d 309, 310 (R.I. 1982).', 'In my judgment, Mr. Catala was entitled to summary judgment based upon the doctrine of judicial admissions—a venerable and fundamental principle of our jurisprudence.', 'For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.', '- 12 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'David S.

64,"Paul Ellis : v. : Verizon New England, Inc. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The petitioner, Paul Ellis, was severely injured when he was assaulted by a stranger in the West End of the City of Providence. Ellis had been sent to that location by his employer, Verizon New England, Inc. (Verizon). Ellis’s claim for workers’ compensation benefits was denied following a trial because the trial judge concluded that Ellis had failed to prove that his injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. The Workers’ Compensation Court Appellate Division (Appellate Division) affirmed the trial judge’s decision and Ellis sought review by this Court. We granted his petition for writ of certiorari, and we now quash the decree of the Appellate Division.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The underlying facts of this case are undisputed. On September 17, 2007, Ellis, a splice service technician, was sent by Verizon to a job site on Union Avenue in the West End of Providence to repair outdoor cable lines. Ellis testified that, when he arrived, he heard a man, who was standing across the street, yelling, among other things: “The country is going down. The president is dead.” Although he initially ignored the man and went about his repair work, Ellis eventually asked the man what his problem was. In response, the man picked up a piece of', '-1- wood and hit Ellis on the head several times with it. Ellis was taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where he received fourteen staples to treat two wounds on his head. Ellis also attended five counseling sessions with a licensed mental-health professional for treatment of emotional stress.', 'Ellis’s assailant, who had fled the scene after the assault, was apprehended on September 19 and was criminally charged. During the time between the assault on Ellis and the arrest of his assailant, Verizon sent its employees to the West End in pairs rather than alone. Additionally, for a couple of weeks following the assailant’s arrest, Verizon reassigned employees who objected to working alone in that neighborhood. Ellis returned to work on November 12, 2007 and, for the first two weeks after his return, he rode to job sites with another employee. Ellis’s supervisor testified that he was not aware of any other assaults on employees that had taken place in the West End during his thirty-nine-year tenure with the company.', 'At trial, Ellis offered the testimony of James Lucht, who was the Information Group Director at the Providence Plan, an organization that, among other things, compiles and aggregates statistics on violent crimes in various Providence neighborhoods. Lucht provided a “hot spot” map of Providence that showed the relative concentration in various neighborhoods of violent crimes that were committed between 2002 and 2007. Lucht described the data-collection method used by the Providence Plan in creating this map and testified that “violent crimes” included murder, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Although the map depicted the West End as a high-violent-crime area, Lucht acknowledged that there was no way to tell from looking at the map what proportion of the crimes that occurred there were aggravated assaults, as opposed to murders, rapes, and other violent crimes. Lucht also explained that the map depicted aggregated statistics collected over a long period of time and did not indicate variations in crime rates between, for example, night and day or winter and summer.', 'Additionally, Lucht', '-2- acknowledged that, because of the way crime rates were displayed on the map, it would be possible for a very-low-crime pocket to appear as a high-crime area because the surrounding neighborhoods have a high concentration of violent crime. Finally, Lucht said that, while much of the Providence Plan’s crime data is publicly available on the organization’s website, data breaking down the specific types of violent crimes occurring in each neighborhood is not. The trial justice did not permit Lucht to testify about those statistics, reasoning that Verizon could not be held responsible for knowledge that was not publicly available.', 'The trial judge, although expressing sympathy for Ellis, denied workers’ compensation benefits because he concluded that Ellis’s injuries were noncompensable under Rhode Island’s actual-risk test, which requires that there be some causal connection between the injury suffered by the employee and the employment or the conditions of employment. See Nowicki v. Byrne, 73 R.I. 89, 92, 54 A.2d 7, 9 (1947). The trial judge commended Ellis for demonstrating the high- crime nature of the neighborhood where he was assaulted, but he noted that the statistics did not sufficiently differentiate between aggravated assault and other violent crimes. He also pointed out that there had been no evidence produced that would demonstrate that Verizon was aware of these crime statistics prior to the assault on Ellis; he added that, even if Verizon had been aware, he nonetheless would have concluded that Ellis’s injuries were noncompensable under Rhode Island’s actual-risk test.', 'The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that the trial judge did not err in determining that the evidence adduced at trial failed to establish that this random assault was an actual risk of Ellis’s employment as a splice technician with Verizon. Additionally, the Appellate Division agreed with the trial judge’s assessment that the Providence Plan’s crime data were not specific', '-3- enough to establish that Ellis was subjected to a special or increased risk of being assaulted at the particular time he was sent to perform service in the West End.', 'Ellis petitioned this Court for writ of certiorari, which we granted.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Upon a petition for certiorari, we review a decree of the Appellate Division for any error of law or equity pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-35-30.” 1 Mumma v.

Re: Narragansett Brewery Fire, 637 A.2d 1047, 1049 (R.I. 1994). However, we review de novo questions of statutory construction. Mumma, 965 A.2d at 441.', 'Whether a workers’ compensation claimant has demonstrated the requisite causal connection between his injury and his employment is a mixed question of law and fact: “This 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-35-30 limits this Court’s review of the Appellate Division’s decrees as follows:', '“(a) Upon petition for certiorari, the [S]upreme [C]ourt may', 'affirm, set aside, or modify any decree of the appellate [division]', 'of the workers’ compensation court only upon the following', 'grounds:', '“(1) That the workers’ compensation court acted without or', 'in excess of its authority;', '“(2) That the order, decree, or award was procured by', 'fraud; or', '“(3) That the appellate division erred on questions of law or', 'equity, the petitioner first having had his objections noted to any', 'adverse rulings made during the progress of the hearing at the time', 'the rulings were made, if made in open hearing and not otherwise', 'of record.', '“(b) Review shall not be granted by the [S]upreme [C]ourt', 'except as provided in this section, and the [S]upreme [C]ourt shall', 'disregard any irregularity or error of the appellate division or trial', 'judge unless it affirmatively appears that the petitioner was', 'damaged by the irregularity or error.”', '-4- [C]ourt is bound by the [Workers’ Compensation] [C]ommission’s findings regarding the facts surrounding the accident, and we will review those findings only to determine if the record contains competent legal evidence in support thereof.” Maggiacomo v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 508 A.2d 402, 403 (R.I. 1986). However, if the facts are undisputed or “would lead to but one conclusion, then the question of whether the injury arose out of the employment is one of law and the [C]ourt is permitted to substitute its judgment for that of the [C]ommission.” Branco v. Leviton Manufacturing Co., 518 A.2d 621, 622 (R.I. 1986); DeNardo v. Fairmount Foundries Cranston, Inc., 121 R.I. 440, 449, 339 A.2d 1229, 1234 (1979).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Ellis specifies several errors in the Appellate Division’s decision. These can be broken down into four general arguments—two of which concern the compensability of Ellis’s injury under Rhode Island law; the third pertains to the relevance of Verizon’s knowledge about the West End’s dangerousness; and the fourth concerns the proper methods for proving the causal connection between injury and employment.', 'First, Ellis argues that the actual-risk standard was satisfied here because “street perils,” such as being assaulted by a stranger, are an actual risk of working in the West End. Next, Ellis avers that Verizon’s decision to send him to work in a dangerous neighborhood created a “special risk” that Ellis would be assaulted and that assault was, therefore, an actual risk of his employment. Third, Ellis complains that the trial judge (and the Appellate Division) erred in considering whether Verizon was on notice that the West End is a high-crime area in reaching the determination on compensability and in excluding evidence. Finally, Ellis asserts that the Appellate Division erred in affirming the trial court’s', '-5- conclusion that the crime data he presented at trial did not sufficiently separate the incidence of aggravated assaults from other types of violent crimes.', 'A', 'Compensability of the Injury', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-33-1 provides for workers’ compensation benefits to be paid to an employee who “receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his or her employment, connected and referable to the employment * * *.” Under Rhode Island law, the claimant carries the burden of demonstrating that this “nexus or causal connection exists between the injury sustained and the employment.” Toolin v. Aquidneck Island Medical Resource, 668 A.2d 639, 640 (R.I. 1995); see also Gaudette v. Glas-Kraft, Inc., 91 R.I. 304, 306, 163 A.2d 23, 24-25 (1960) (“Under § 28-33-1 the [claimant] * * * ha[s] the burden of establishing that he suffered a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, connected therewith and referable thereto.”). To determine whether the requisite nexus exists between the injury and the employment, we apply a three-part test first adopted by this Court in Di Libero v. Middlesex Construction Co., 63 R.I. 509, 516, 9 A.2d 848, 851 (1939).', '“We first inquire whether the injury occurred within the period of', 'the employee’s employment. Next, we examine the situs of the', 'injury to determine whether it occurred at a place where the', 'employee might reasonably have been expected to be. Third, we', 'inquire whether the employee was reasonably fulfilling the duties', 'of his or her job at the time of the injury or was performing some', 'task incidental to those conditions under which those duties were', 'to be performed.” Toolin, 668 A.2d at 641. Here, it is undisputed that Ellis was injured during the period of his employment at a place where Verizon might reasonably have expected him to be. Therefore, we need only determine whether, at the time he was assaulted, Ellis was “reasonably fulfilling the duties of his * * * job * * * or', '-6- was performing some task incidental to those conditions under which those duties were to be performed.” Id.', 'Modern courts generally take one of three approaches to determine whether the risk that caused an injury is one “arising out of and in the course of [an employee’s] employment.” See 1 Arthur Larson & Lex K. Larson, Larson’s Workers’ Compensation Law § 3.01 at 3-2, 3-4 (Matthew Bender, rev. ed. 2012). Some jurisdictions apply an “increased-risk” test, under which an injury is compensable if the employment increased the amount of exposure to a general risk that is not unique to that employment but, rather, is one to which the general public is exposed. Id. § 3.03 at 3-5. Other jurisdictions apply an “actual-risk” standard, under which an injury is compensable even if it was caused by a risk that is common to the general public, so long as the risk was an actual risk of that particular employment. Id. § 3.04 at 3-5.', 'Finally, some jurisdictions have embraced the “positional-risk” test, the broadest of the three, which essentially applies a “but-for” analysis: if, but for the requirements or conditions of the employment, the employee would not have been in the position that exposed him or her to risk of injury, that injury is compensable. Id. § 3.05 at 3-6. This Court has consistently taken the position that only those injuries arising from the actual risks of employment are compensable under the Di Libero standard. See Dawson v. A & H MFG. Co., 463 A.2d 519, 521 (R.I. 1983) (“Our holdings * * * clearly indicate that Rhode Island has not adopted a positional-risk test and probably should be placed in the actual-risk category.”).', 'This Court has not yet been called upon to determine under what circumstances the risk of random assault by a stranger is an actual risk of employment. 2 However, courts of other 2', 'We have previously addressed workplace assaults, but our cases are not directly on point with the case at bar because they involved assaults that were either personally motivated or clearly work-related. For example, in Gaudette v. Glas-Kraft, Inc., 91 R.I. 304, 305, 163 A.2d 23, 24', '-7- jurisdictions and legal scholars have explored this issue extensively. See, e.g., Larson’s Workers’ Compensation Law § 8.03[2][b] at 8-63 to -66. In particular, Professor Larson has thoroughly reviewed how courts have treated “neutral assaults,” which he defines to mean “those assaults which are in essence equivalent to blind or irrational forces, such as attacks by lunatics, drunks, small children, and other irresponsibles; completely unexplained assaults; and assaults by mistake.” Id. § 8.03[1] at 8-62. He observes that a minority of jurisdictions treat such assaults as noncompensable “for want of affirmative proof of distinctive employment risk as the cause of the harm,” but that a growing number of jurisdictions have begun to treat injuries from random assaults as compensable under a positional-risk standard. Id.', 'Ellis argues that being randomly assaulted by a stranger was an actual risk of his employment with Verizon. In particular, he attempts to draw an analogy between the facts of his case and this Court’s jurisprudence recognizing the “street perils” associated with traveling on public roadways as actual risks of employment. Verizon responds that the Appellate Division correctly applied Rhode Island’s actual-risk test to the case at bar and that the “street perils” line of cases should not be expanded to encompass criminal activity.', 'In limited circumstances, our jurisprudence has recognized certain “street perils” as actual risks of employment, permitting compensation where employees have been injured while (1960), an employee was injured in a fight with a co-worker while using the company sink. We consider the fight in that case to be distinguishable from the random assault at issue here because, there, the trial court concluded that the basis of the quarrel was private rather than employment-related and, therefore, “the assault was not attributable in whole or in part to the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of petitioner’s employment * * *.” Id. at 307, 163 A.2d at 25. In Correia v. McCormick, 51 R.I 301, 302, 303, 154 A. 276, 276 (1931), overruled on other grounds, St. Goddard v. Potter & Johnson Machine Co., 69 R.I. 90, 94, 31 A.2d 20, 22 (1943), this Court awarded compensation when an employee was struck by an angry truck driver who was attempting to deliver gravel to a construction site. There, we concluded that the assault was prompted by the employee’s refusal to stray from protocol and, thus, arose out of his job duties. Id. at 303, 154 A. at 276.', '-8- using public roadways in connection with their employment. For example, in Sullivan v. State, 89 R.I. 119, 122, 151 A.2d 360, 362 (1959), we held that, when a court employee was struck by an automobile while returning to the courthouse from a refreshment run that had been sanctioned by his supervisor, his injuries were compensable because “[i]n th[o]se circumstances the employment required the [employee] to use the public highway and therefore the risks of such highway must be considered risks of the employment.” Similarly, in Branco, 518 A.2d at 623, we held that when an employer required its employees to cross a busy road to get from the employee parking lot to the employer’s facility, and an employee was hit by an automobile while crossing the road on the way to his shift, his injury was compensable. There, we reasoned that “because [the] employer placed [the employee] in the position of having to negotiate [a busy road] each work day in order to reach his post, the risk entailed in crossing the highway must be considered a condition incident to his employment.” Id. Finally, in Toolin, 668 A.2d at 640, 641, we concluded that, when a nursing assistant who was required by her employer to travel to and from patients’ homes was injured in an automobile accident while traveling between patients’ homes, “the risk of travel on public roads must be considered a condition incident to [the employee’s] employment,” notwithstanding the fact that her employer neither paid her for travel time nor reimbursed her for travel expenses.', 'However, we also have held that injuries caused by other risks unrelated to the common perils of the roadways are noncompensable. For instance, we held that, when an employee who had completed his workday and was departing from his employer’s facility (Hillsgrove Airport, which is now named Theodore Francis Green Airport) in his own automobile was hit by a stray bullet that had been fired on a neighboring property, the injury was deemed to be noncompensable because being hit by a stray bullet “was not a natural or necessary', '-9- consequence” of the employee’s employment at the airport. Nowicki, 73 R.I. at 90-91, 93, 54 A.2d at 8, 9.3 Similarly, when an employee was stung by a bee in the hallway of his employer’s facility, we held that the injury was noncompensable because the employee failed to demonstrate “that this risk, even though common to the public, was in fact a risk of his employment.” Dawson, 463 A.2d at 521-22. See also Maggiacomo, 508 A.2d at 403, 404 (holding that, under the actual-risk standard, when a bus driver threw out his back as a result of a coughing fit that was otherwise unrelated to his employment, his injuries were noncompensable).', 'We also are mindful of the tension between two policies underlying Rhode Island’s Workers’ Compensation Act. On one hand, “[t]his [C]ourt has consistently repeated that the concept underlying the Workers’ Compensation Act is to provide financial and medical benefits to workers who have been injured while on the job by making the employer carry the burden to provide payments.” Dawson, 463 A.2d at 522 (Bevilacqua, C.J., and Kelleher, J., dissenting) (citing Guilmette v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 114 R.I. 508, 512, 336 A.2d 553, 555 (1975); Nardolillo v. Big G Supermarket, Inc., 111 R.I. 751, 755, 306 A.2d 844, 847 (1973)); see also DeNardo, 121 R.I. at 452, 399 A.2d at 1236 (Kelleher, J., concurring) (“This [C]ourt has long recognized that the Act’s provisions must be given a liberal construction with an eye to effectuating their evident humanitarian purpose.”). On the other hand, “the Legislature clearly did not intend for the act to compensate every worker who is injured while at his place of employment regardless of the circumstances involved.” Maggiacomo, 508 A.2d at 404; see also Zuchowski v. United States Rubber Co., 102 R.I. 165, 172, 175, 229 A.2d 61, 65, 66 (1967) (“To hold [an idiopathic workplace fall compensable] would convert workmen’s compensation into a 3', 'Interestingly, Professor Larson notes “an almost complete parallel between the lunatic-assault cases and stray-bullet cases, as they originate as extensions of the street-risk doctrine * * *.” Arthur Larson & Lex K.

This we cannot accept, as it was never the intent of the [L]egislature to afford this type of protection to an injured workman.”).', 'Having carefully considered our own case law, the policies underlying the Workers’ Compensation Act, and persuasive authority, we conclude that Ellis’s injury here is compensable under the street-peril doctrine. Ellis’s employment for Verizon required that he park his work vehicle on public streets and then walk to and from his vehicle, as the tasks required. It was in the course of returning to his work vehicle that he was assaulted on a public street, apparently randomly, by an individual whom the trial judge characterized as “at least slightly off his rocker.” This Court has held that the risk of being injured in an automobile accident is among the street perils to which an employee is exposed when his or her employment requires travel on public roads. See Toolin, 668 A.2d at 641; Branco, 518 A.2d at 623; Sullivan, 89 R.I. at 122, 151 A.2d at 362. Thus, we conclude that, under our established case law, had Ellis been struck by a car—rather than by a stick-wielding assailant—as he returned to where his work vehicle was parked on the street, his injuries would have been compensable. See, e.g., Branco, 518 A.2d at 623; Sullivan, 89 R.I. at 122, 151 A.2d at 362. We discern no meaningful difference between being struck by an assailant and being struck by an automobile (both while traveling on a public road) because, in either instance, the possibility of injury is an actual risk to which employees are necessarily exposed if they are required by their employers to travel on public roads.', 'Moreover, we are satisfied that the street-risk doctrine is not confined to automobile accidents. In a case cited by this Court in Sullivan, 89 R.I. at 122, 151 A.2d at 362, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed an award of compensation to a chauffeur who had been stabbed, stating that “[t]he risk of being stabbed by an insane man running amuck seems in a peculiar sense a risk incidental to the streets to which [the] claimant was exposed by his employment.”', '- 11 - Katz v. A. Kadans & Co., 134 N.E. 330, 331 (N.Y. 1922). In a rather stark portrayal of the perils of urban life, the court explained:', '“The street becomes a dangerous place when street brawlers,', 'highwaymen, escaping criminals, or violent madmen are afoot', 'therein as they sometimes are. The danger of being struck by them', 'by accident is a street risk because it is incident to passing through', 'or being on the street when dangerous characters are abroad.', '“Particularly on the crowded streets of a great city, not only', 'do vehicles collide, pavements become out of repair, and crowds', 'jostle, but mad or biting dogs may run wild, gunmen may', 'discharge their weapons, police officers may shoot at fugitives', 'fleeing from justice, or other things may happen from which', 'accidental injuries result to people on the streets which are peculiar', 'to the use of the streets and do not commonly happen indoors.” Id. We hasten to add that, notwithstanding such colorful language, the specific risks to which an employee may be exposed on the public roadways by virtue of his or her employment must perforce be the subject of a case-by-case analysis.', 'We also emphasize that our holding in this case should not be construed as a retreat from the actual-risk test. We reach our conclusion, rather, in recognition of the principle “that the risks of the street are the risks of the employment, if the employment requires the employee’s use of the street.” Hudson v. Thurston Motor Lines, Inc., 583 S.W.2d 597, 602 (Tenn. 1979). Clearly, Ellis, as a splice service technician for Verizon, was exposed to the risks of the street on a regular basis. We are satisfied that such risks include the risk of a random assault by a stranger, as distinguished from an assault specifically directed against an employee for non- employment-related reasons.

65,: Inc. et al. v. : Verissimo DePina et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Amy Realty, 1 appeals from the Superior Court’s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), Citigroup Global Markets Realty, and Regions Bank d/b/a Regions Mortgage (collectively, plaintiffs). On appeal, the defendant argues that the Superior Court erred in vacating a final decree foreclosing the plaintiffs’ rights of redemption in a Central Falls property that had been sold to the defendant at a tax auction and in declaring a deed conveying that property to be null and void. The defendant contends, rather, that the Superior Court misconstrued G.L. 1956 § 44-9-24 2 and that, under §§ 44-9-30 and 44-9-31 the plaintiffs are barred from redeeming the property and from raising defects in the tax sale and 1', 'Although several defendants were named below, only Amy Realty has appealed the Superior Court’s judgment. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-9-24 provides that a party with an interest in a property sold at a tax sale may institute a separate action seeking to vacate a final decree of foreclosure within one year of its issuance, but only', '“for inadequacy of notice of the petition amounting to a denial of', 'due process or for the invalidity of the tax sale because the taxes', 'for which the property was sold had been paid or were not due and', 'owing because the property was exempt from the payment of such', 'taxes.”', '-1- foreclosure proceedings. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In January 2008, the Pawtucket Water Supply Board (PWSB) mailed a notice to Verissimo DePina informing him that the water bill on his property located at 18 Perry Street in Central Falls was past due, and that the PWSB would move forward with a water lien sale unless payment was received or an alternative arrangement was negotiated. 3 In April 2008 (apparently having received no response to the first notice), the PWSB sent DePina a second notice of the sale informing him that his property at 18 Perry Street would be advertised for a tax sale on May 6, 2008 and that it would be sold at public auction on May 29, 2008. 4 Both notices listed the property to be sold as 18 Perry Street, Assessor’s Plat No. 5, lot No. 486 (Lot 486), even though DePina’s property was in fact Assessor’s Plat No. 5, lot No. 456 (Lot 456). The PWSB also publicly advertised the sale of Lot 486 pursuant to § 44-9-9.', 'At the time these notices were sent, MERS (as nominee for lenders Citigroup Global Markets Realty and Regions Bank) held first and second mortgages on the property, which were appropriately recorded in the land evidence records. It is undisputed that, notwithstanding the requirement of § 44-9-11(a) that mortgagees of record receive notice at least twenty days in 3', 'There is some dispute as to the correct street address of DePina’s property. The PWSB’s records refer to the property as “18 Perry Street,” but at least one mortgage document lists the property as “20 Perry Street.” However, given the other, more significant deficiencies in the way that the property was listed on the operative documents, we need not pass on whether this discrepancy has any impact on the tax sale and subsequent foreclosure. 4', 'Section 44-9-10(a) requires that notice of a tax sale be sent both “to the street address of the real estate liable for payment of taxes, and, if different, to the taxpayer’s address listed with the tax assessor’s office of the city or town where the real estate is located.” DePina’s mailing address on file with the PWSB was in Dorchester, Massachusetts, but it appears that only the first of the two notices was sent to his Dorchester address.', '-2- advance of a tax sale, plaintiffs did not receive any notice. In addition to DePina, however, Raquel Valdez (the record owner of Lot 486) and the mortgagees of record of Lot 486 received notice of the sale.', 'On May 29, 2008, the PWSB auctioned the lot advertised in the newspaper as “Plat 5, Lot 486, taxed to Verissimo DePina,” for $2,027.81. Subsequently, the PWSB issued a deed purportedly conveying “all of the right, title and interest of the said Raquel Valdez, Bank of America, N.A., and Verissimo Depina * * * in and to that certain tract or parcel of land * * * designated as Plat 5, Lot 486” to Amy Realty. The parties do not dispute that the tax deed was recorded within sixty days of the sale, as is required by § 44-9-12(a). When Lot 486 was not redeemed within one year, Amy Realty initiated foreclosure proceedings pursuant to § 44-9- 25(a). However, after obtaining a title report and sending notice of the foreclosure petition to various parties, Amy Realty received a telephone call from Valdez, the record owner of Lot 486, who asserted that her water bill with the PWSB was current. Upon consulting with the PWSB, Amy Realty became aware that the property that the PWSB had intended to auction (Lot 456) had been mistakenly listed as “Lot 486” on the tax sale notices and deed. To correct this incongruity, Amy Realty sought and obtained a “corrective” deed from the PWSB purportedly conveying “all of the right, title and interest of the said Raquel Valdez, Bank of America, N.A., and Verissimo Depina * * * in and to that certain tract or parcel of land * * * designated as Plat 5, Lot 456,” and that deed was recorded in September 2009. Additionally, Amy Realty prepared a redemption deed for Valdez, reconveying Lot 486 to her so that there would be no cloud on her title. It is undisputed that neither Raquel Valdez nor Bank of America ever held an interest in Lot 456.', '-3-', 'Amy Realty’s representative gave deposition testimony that, at the time of the tax sale, he was under the impression that he had bid on and purchased Lot 486, not Lot 456, and that until Valdez contacted him, he was not aware of the discrepancy as to the lot numbers. Additionally, he acknowledged that, aside from DePina, the parties with actual interests in Lot 456 (namely, plaintiffs) did not receive notice of the sale.', 'Thereafter, Amy Realty filed an amended petition to foreclose, this time on Lot 456, and sent notice to each of the parties with an interest in Lot 456, including plaintiffs. 5 However, plaintiffs did not respond; and, in December 2009, a final decree was entered foreclosing plaintiffs’ rights of redemption in Lot 456.', 'In April 2010, plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking injunctive and declaratory relief under § 44-9-24.', 'Specifically, plaintiffs urged the Superior Court to vacate the final decree of foreclosure, alleging that the corrective deed changing the lot number from 486 to 456 was invalid and that this infirmity rendered the foreclosure decree void. 6 Amy Realty answered the complaint, and the parties proceeded with discovery. 7', 'In March 2011, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their injunctive and declaratory relief count. Amy Realty objected. After hearing arguments from the parties on April 26, 2011, the Superior Court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs, concluding that because the corrective deed was filed more than a year after the tax sale, it did not comply with § 44-9-12, which requires that a tax-sale deed be filed within sixty days of the sale. Additionally, the hearing justice observed that Lot 486 (rather than 5', 'The plaintiffs acknowledge that they received this notice of Amy Realty’s amended petition to foreclose on Lot 456. 6', 'The plaintiffs later amended their complaint to plead tortious interference with contractual relations and deprivation of federal civil rights. However, the Superior Court’s judgment did not resolve these later-added counts, and they are not at issue in this appeal. 7', 'The plaintiffs named other defendants in this action in addition to Amy Realty. However, because only Amy Realty is party to this appeal, we confine our recitation of the case’s procedural history to only that portion pertaining to Amy Realty.', '-4- Lot 456) was sold at the tax sale even though the only outstanding water bill in the case was on Lot 456, and thus he held that § 44-9-24 permitted the Superior Court to vacate the final foreclosure decree. Finally, at a hearing on June 7, 2011, the hearing justice clarified that, in addition to the reasons he noted at the April 26 hearing, he also believed that there was a “due process issue” with the way the tax sale and foreclosure had proceeded. Amy Realty timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The grant of a motion for summary judgment is reviewed by this Court de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Great American E & S Insurance Co. v. End Zone Pub & Grill of Narragansett, Inc., 45 A.3d 571, 574 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Generation Realty, LLC v. Catanzaro, 21 A.3d 253, 258 (R.I. 2011)). Thus, we will affirm a grant of summary judgment if, in “reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id.

Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012). “As a general matter, the authority for the sale of real estate for delinquent taxes ‘must be found in the statutes and such statutes will not be enlarged by judicial construction but will be strictly construed in favor of the owner.’” 140 Reservoir Avenue Associates v. Sepe Investments, LLC, 941 A.2d 805, 810 (R.I. 2007) (quoting First Bank & Trust Co. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 606, 610 (R.I. 2003)).', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Amy Realty argues that the Superior Court erred in vacating the foreclosure decree because, once the foreclosure decree was entered, plaintiffs were “forever barred” from seeking redemption or challenging the validity of the proceeding under the provisions of §§ 44-9-30 and 44-9-31. Additionally, Amy Realty posits that § 44-9-24 does not apply in this case because minimum due-process requirements were met when plaintiffs received notice of the foreclosure proceeding, the “single digit” error in the tax sale notices listing the incorrect lot number was neither substantial nor misleading, and a water bill was actually due and owing for Lot 456 (the property for which Amy Realty obtained a corrective deed and upon which it ultimately foreclosed). Finally, Amy Realty suggests that, because DePina owned only one property in Central Falls and the tax sale notices listed DePina as record owner of the property to be sold, it should have been obvious to plaintiffs, had they conducted due diligence, that the property referenced in the tax sale advertisement and notices was actually Lot 456, notwithstanding the fact that the notices (which plaintiffs never received) described the property as Lot 486. The plaintiffs respond that the hearing justice correctly applied § 44-9-24’s “safety valve” both in concluding that taxes were not owed on Lot 486 (the property actually sold at the tax auction) and that their due-process rights were violated here because they did not receive proper notice of the tax sale.', 'The procedure for tax sales, redemptions, and foreclosures in Rhode Island is set forth in a series of statutory provisions. See chapter 9 of title 44. We have noted that, “[b]ecause tax sales ‘are or may be * * * penal in effect,’ * * * ‘[l]egislatures and courts have acted to ameliorate the severity of tax forfeitures’ in light of the ‘inequity of the owner’s inordinate', '-6- loss.’” ABAR Associates, a RIGP v. Luna, 870 A.2d 990, 994 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Albertson v. Leca, 447 A.2d 383, 388 (R.I. 1982)). Thus, we have observed that Rhode Island’s statutory scheme “strikes a fair balance between the interests of the government and private property rights—the state may move quickly to obtain by sale the taxes due, but the owner has ample opportunity to redeem his real estate.” Id. (quoting Albertson, 447 A.2d at 388). We also recognize that a concurrent goal of the tax sale statute is to “afford a measure of stability to tax titles.” Id. (quoting Picerne v. Sylvestre, 122 R.I. 85, 89, 404 A.2d 476, 478 (1979)).', 'To resolve the issues raised in this appeal we must examine several intertwined provisions of Rhode Island’s tax sale statutes. First, § 44-9-11(a) requires that any mortgagee whose interest is recorded ninety days before the date of the tax sale receive notice of the tax sale by registered mail at least twenty days in advance of the sale. Additionally, § 44-9-11(c) provides that, once a petition for a final decree of foreclosure has been filed, a mortgagee entitled to notice of the tax sale “must raise the notice defense * * * or be estopped from alleging lack of notice in any action to vacate a final decree * * *.”', 'Section 44-9-12(a) provides that, following a tax sale, the tax sale deed must be recorded within sixty days, or it is invalid. During the one-year period following a tax sale, a person with an interest in the property (including a mortgagee) may redeem the property by tendering to the purchaser the purchase price as well as fees, taxes, and other penalties. See §§ 44-9-21 and 44- 9-25(a). After one year has passed without redemption, § 44-9-25(a) permits the purchaser to file a petition in the Superior Court seeking to foreclose all rights of redemption. Prior to foreclosure, the purchaser must send notice of the foreclosure petition to all parties with an interest in the property, including the mortgagees of record, and any interested party may seek to', '-7- redeem the property by filing an answer and an offer to redeem on or before the return day. 8 See §§ 44-9-27(a) and 44-9-29. If there is no redemption within that timeframe, “a decree shall be entered which shall forever bar all rights of redemption.” Section 44-9-30.', 'A final foreclosure decree carries with it significant consequences for any party who had an interest in the property prior to the tax sale: § 44-9-24 provides that “title conveyed by a tax collector’s deed shall be absolute after foreclosure of the right of redemption,” and it permits an interested party to challenge the foreclosure within one year of the decree, but only on the grounds that there was', '“inadequacy of notice of the petition amounting to a denial of due', 'process or for the invalidity of the tax sale because the taxes for', 'which the property was sold had been paid or were not due and', 'owing because the property was exempt from the payment of such', 'taxes.” Id. Moreover, § 44-9-31 makes clear that', '“If a person claiming an interest desires to raise any', 'question concerning the validity of a tax title, the person shall do', 'so by answer filed in the proceeding on or before the return day, or', 'within that further time as may on motion be allowed by the court', 'or else be forever barred from contesting or raising the question in', 'any other proceeding.” Finally, § 44-9-35 provides that “[n]o tax title shall be held to be invalid by reason of any error or irregularity which is neither substantial nor misleading * * *.”', 'This Court has recognized the finality that Rhode Island’s tax foreclosure procedure provides to purchasers, and we have consistently upheld the strict bar to tax sale challenges erected by §§ 44-9-30 and 44-9-31 when notice of the foreclosure petition was proper. We have repeatedly held that “upon notice of a petition for foreclosure of the right of redemption, the 8', 'Section 44-9-28 requires that the return day be at least twenty days after the “actual issuance of notice” to interested parties.', '-8- failure by one who owns an interest in real estate to file an answer or specifications on or before the return day forever bars that party from later contesting the validity of the tax title,” because “once a ‘foreclosure [of redemption] decree has been entered, the title conveyed by the tax collector’s deed becomes absolute.’” Kildeer Realty v. Brewster Realty Corp., 826 A.2d 961, 967 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Picerne v. Sylvestre, 113 R.I. 598, 600, 324 A.2d 617, 618 (1974)). For example, when a property owner did not receive notice of a tax sale because its recently recorded interest was not uncovered by a title search, but it did receive notice of the foreclosure petition and failed to respond, we held that it was barred by §§ 44-9-30 and 44-9-31 from seeking to vacate the foreclosure decree on the basis of defects at the tax sale stage. Kildeer Realty, 826 A.2d at 963, 966-67. In particular, we concluded that', '“the explicit language of [§§ 44-9-30 and 44-9-31 is] controlling in', 'this case; and any subsequent claims by [the owner] were forever', 'barred. Any previous defects in the notice procedure of the tax', 'sale were negated by [the owner’s] subsequent failure to answer or', 'appear upon notice of the petition to foreclose its rights of', 'redemption. We deem [the owner’s] failure to answer on or before', 'the return day to be fatal to its appeal.” Kildeer Realty, 826 A.2d at', '966-67. Our case law has consistently prevented those who previously held an interest in property sold at a tax sale from attacking a final decree of foreclosure when they have been properly noticed of the foreclosure proceedings but have failed to take action prior to the return day to protect their redemption rights. See Medeiros v. Bankers Trust Co., 38 A.3d 1112, 1113-14, 1119 (R.I. 2012) (holding that, when a property owner who had received notice of the tax sale and foreclosure petition failed to answer the foreclosure petition, he was barred from subsequently claiming an interest in the property); ABAR Associates, 870 A.2d at 991, 992, 996, 997 (concluding that the holder of an unrecorded interest who was not entitled to receive notice of the tax sale or', '-9- foreclosure petition could not intervene in a subsequent challenge to the final decree barring his right to redeem).', 'The plaintiffs urge us to apply our holding in Sycamore Properties, LLC v. Tabriz Realty, LLC, 870 A.2d 424 (R.I. 2005), to the issues at bar. There we held that, under an earlier version of § 44-9-24, when a property owner who did not receive notice of the tax sale but did receive notice of the foreclosure petition (through an agent) failed to answer the foreclosure petition, he was not barred from bringing a separate action to assert his rights to the property. Sycamore Properties, LLC, 870 A.2d at 425, 428. At that time, § 44-9-24 permitted the Superior Court to vacate a foreclosure decree when there was an “inadequacy of notice amounting to a denial of due process.” Sycamore Properties, LLC, 870 A.2d at 427 (quoting § 44-9-24). We noted that the phrase “inadequacy of notice” was “susceptible to three interpretations: inadequacy of notice of the tax sale; inadequate notice of the foreclosure petition; or both.” Id. at 428. We observed that “§ 44-9-24 operates as a ‘safety valve’ for taxpayers who have lost their right of redemption because of an invalid tax sale, notwithstanding noncompliance with § 44-9-31,” and we concluded that the property owner was not barred from challenging the final decree of foreclosure on the grounds that notice of the initial tax sale was inadequate. Sycamore Properties, LLC, 870 A.2d at 426, 428. However, as Amy Realty correctly points out, § 44-9-24 has since been amended, and the operative phrase—“inadequacy of notice amounting to a denial of due process”—now reads, “inadequacy of notice of the petition amounting to a denial of due process.” See § 44-9-24, as amended by P.L. 2006, ch. 537, § 4 (emphasis added). Amy Realty argues that, by adding the term “petition” to the statute, the General Assembly restricted notice challenges to only those situations in which an interest holder did not receive notice of the foreclosure petition itself, thereby delimiting this Court’s broader interpretation in Sycamore.', '- 10 -', 'Although the General Assembly’s post-Sycamore amendments may have significantly narrowed the notice-based “safety valve” of § 44-9-24, the statute retains a second avenue through which an interested party may attack a tax sale following a final decree of foreclosure. An action to vacate may also be instituted “for the invalidity of a tax sale because the taxes for which the property was sold had been paid.” Section 44-9-24. Here, Amy Realty did not dispute that Valdez was current on her water bill for Lot 486, the property purportedly sold at the tax sale. The hearing justice concluded, as one basis for his decision, that taxes were not due and owing on the property sold at the tax auction (Lot 486), and thus he permitted plaintiffs to challenge the tax sale’s validity under § 44-9-24 notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 44-9-30 and 44-9-31.', 'Amy Realty maintains that the corrective deed changing the lot number from 486 to 456 obviates this deficiency because it relates back to the date of the tax sale, such that the law deems Lot 456 to have been the property sold at the tax sale. Thus, Amy Realty’s title to Lot 456 hinges on the validity of the corrective deed purporting to alter the lot number of the property auctioned at the tax sale. Amy Realty seeks to minimize the error as a “typo,” perhaps similar to a misspelling in the grantee’s name, a slight mistake in a deed’s expression of metes and bounds, or any other clerical error that may be rectified simply by obtaining a corrective deed. However, we are of the opinion that to describe this discrepancy in lot numbers as a mere “typo” grossly mischaracterizes the nature and import of the error; not only did this mistake cause the PWSB to notice incorrect parties, but it also caused the wrong lot to be sold at auction.', 'It does not appear that we have previously been called upon to determine which types of errors may be rectified through a corrective tax sale deed, but the weight of authority suggests that corrective deeds may not be used to fix such fundamental errors as selling the incorrect lot at', '- 11 - a tax sale. We find the Texas Supreme Court’s well-reasoned opinion in Myrad Properties, Inc. v. LaSalle Bank National Association, 300 S.W.3d 746 (Tex. 2009), to be instructive on this point. There, a trustee for the beneficiaries of a deed of trust brought an action to foreclose on two apartment complexes owned by the borrower. Id. at 748. The trustee, intending to purchase both properties, made the sole bid at the foreclosure sale. Id. at 748-49. However, because of an apparent mistake at the sale, only one of the two properties actually was sold and the resulting deed conveyed only that single property. Id. at 749. Upon realizing the mistake, the trustee obtained a “correction deed” purporting to convey both properties. Id. The Texas Supreme Court held that a corrective deed could not be used to correct such an error, noting that, while it “ha[s] long allowed agreeable parties to use correction deeds in limited circumstances,” nonetheless, “the proper use of a correction deed is narrow in scope.” Id. at 750. Specifically, the court explained that, although corrective deeds may be appropriate to rectify inaccuracies in the expression of metes and bounds of a single property or insufficient descriptions indicating a grantor’s capacity, “using a correction deed to convey an additional, separate parcel of land is beyond the appropriate scope of a correction deed.” Id. The court reasoned that, to maintain the integrity of the real property system, corrective deeds are appropriate only under a limited set of circumstances:', '“Preserving the narrow circumstances for acceptable use of', 'a correction deed is important because a proper correction deed', 'may relate back to the date of the deed it corrects. * * * To allow', 'correction deeds to convey additional, separate properties not', 'described in the original deed would introduce unwarranted and', 'unnecessary confusion, distrust, and expense into the Texas real', 'property records system. For example, it could require those who', 'must rely on such records to look beyond the deed and research the', 'circumstances of ownership to make sure that no conveyance', 'mistake such as that before us in this case was made, undermining', 'the entire purpose of record notice.” Id. at 750-51.', '- 12 - Thus, the court held the corrective deed purporting to convey both lots when only one was sold at the foreclosure sale to be void. Id. at 751.', 'Other persuasive authority also supports the conclusion that a corrective deed may not be used to correct an error as fundamental as conveying the wrong lot. For example, Corpus Juris Secundum recognizes the validity of corrective deeds when used to rectify minor irregularities, but cautions that corrective deeds may not be employed when doing so would prejudice the rights of third parties:', '“Where there is no fraud and the rights of third persons', 'have not intervened, and equity could have reformed the deed, it', 'may be amended by a subsequent instrument so as to effectuate the', 'intention of the parties. This rule applies to a mistake in the', 'description of the property, or to omission of conditions by mutual', 'mistake, or to a deed executed and antedated to replace a destroyed', 'instrument, even though done without the grantee’s knowledge.', '“* * *', '“Ordinarily, a correction deed relates back to the date of the', 'document that it purports to express more accurately, as long as no', 'new rights are thereby affected. However, as against third persons,', 'an alleged defective deed can be cured only by a bill in equity, and', 'not by a confirmation assuming to relate back to the original deed.”', '26A C.J.S. Deeds § 40 at 66-67, 68 (2011).', 'Here, the mistake at the tax auction and in the resulting deed was far more fundamental than a simple misspelling of a party’s name or a slightly incorrect property description: the initial tax deed here purported to convey an entirely different property than the property for which a water bill was due and owing. In the original deed, the property conveyed was described only as “Plat 5, Lot 486,” and the parties whose interests were being transferred included Raquel Valdez and Bank of America, as well as Verissimo DePina. 9 The weight of authority indicates that a 9', 'It is true that the deed stated that the PWSB did “assess upon Verissimo Depina as a portion of said water charges and assessments upon Plat 5, Lot 486, being property located at 18 Perry', '- 13 - corrective deed is insufficient to correct an error of this magnitude. We agree with the hearing justice that the original tax deed purported to convey Lot 486, and that the corrective deed, relating to an entirely different parcel of land, Lot 456, was null and void because it was not recorded within sixty days of the tax sale as required by § 44-9-11.', 'Additionally, given the policies underlying the tax sale statute, we find Amy Realty’s argument that the corrective deed cured all deficiencies to be untenable under the facts of this case. As we have previously noted:', '“Historically, * * * our law has strongly disfavored', 'forfeitures of real property.', '“* * *', '“Legislatures and courts have acted to ameliorate the', 'severity of tax forfeitures. Although tax-sale statutes furnish a', 'strong arm with which to enforce the government’s right to its', 'revenues, the statutes also protect the right of property owners to', 'their real estate. * * * Because the right of redemption is a valuable', 'property right, * * * and the potential loss to the owner is grave,', 'the courts have as a matter of general policy interpreted tax statutes', 'liberally in favor of redemption.” Albertson, 447 A.2d at 388. We also observe that § 44-9-24 looks to whether the property sold at the “tax sale” owed any taxes, rather than whether the property ultimately foreclosed upon owed taxes. (Emphasis added.) Thus by the statute’s express terms, it is immaterial whether Amy Realty foreclosed on a property with an outstanding water bill, because the property it actually purchased at the tax sale was current on its bill; and, as we have discussed supra, the corrective deed obtained in this case was null and void.', 'Finally, Amy Realty argues that the errors in the tax sale notices listing the property as Lot 486 rather than Lot 456 were cured by § 44-9-35 because they were “neither substantial nor misleading” and could have been overcome by plaintiffs had they exercised ordinary diligence. Street, Central Falls.” This language appears, however, in a recital or “whereas” clause of the deed and not in the operative clause that purports to actually convey the property.', '- 14 - Essentially, Amy Realty asserts that because the tax sale notices listed DePina as the record owner of the property to be sold and DePina owned only one property in Central Falls, if plaintiffs had thoroughly investigated the matter, they would have surmised that the PWSB intended to sell Lot 456, DePina’s only Central Falls property, rather than Lot 486, which was the property actually listed on the tax sale notice. Thus, Amy Realty argues, § 44-9-35 applies to resolve the discrepancy. In support of this argument, Amy Realty cites to Murray v. Schillace, 658 A.2d 512, 513, 514 (R.I. 1995), in which a mortgagee sought to vacate a final decree of foreclosure because tax sale notices (which were sent to the proper parties) misspelled the owner’s name as “Marc Shillace” when it should have been spelled “Marc Schillace.” There, we concluded that the misspelling was “neither substantial nor misleading” under § 44-9-35, reasoning that the mistake “could have been overcome with ordinary diligence.” Murray, 658 A.2d at 514. In particular we cautioned that, “when a bank receives a certified letter legally describing a piece of property and when, in addition, twelve out of thirteen letters of the mortgagor’s name are correct, notice should not be disregarded when foreclosure on the piece of property is at stake.” Id. In contrast, here the error with the lot number caused incorrect parties to be noticed of the tax sale, and thus plaintiffs never received any type of notice that would prompt them to conduct further investigations. We conclude that, under the circumstances presented here, the error was both substantial and misleading vis-à-vis plaintiffs and, therefore, § 44-9-35 did not prevent the court from vacating the final foreclosure decree.', 'For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to avail themselves of the “safety valve” of § 44-9-24. See Sycamore, 870 A.2d at 426. The corrective deed obtained in this case did not resolve the fundamental flaw present in the tax sale—namely, that a property on which no taxes were due was auctioned. Additionally, because the error', '- 15 - present here was both substantial and misleading, Amy Realty may not invoke § 44-9-35 to sanitize this flawed tax sale and foreclosure proceeding. The collector’s deed conveyed title only to Lot 486, and it is undisputed that Lot 486 owed nothing to the PWSB. We therefore conclude that, pursuant to § 44-9-24, the final foreclosure decree may be vacated “for the invalidity of the tax sale because the taxes for which the property was sold had been paid * * *.”', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

In these consolidated cases, Nancy Griggs, Patricia Griggs, and Lauren Griggs (collectively, appellants) appeal from Superior Court judgments dismissing their appeals from a Warwick Probate Court order. The appellants argue that the trial justice erred when he dismissed their appeals for failure to provide a sufficient record as required by G.L. 1956 § 33-23-1. These cases came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in these appeals should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that these cases may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'These cases have followed a long and tortuous path, beginning in 2000 with an unsuccessful bid by Lauren Griggs, inter alios, for guardianship of her father, Glenn E. Griggs, 1 then winding through an (ultimately successful) emergency petition for guardianship, filed by Glenn Griggs’s son, Dan Griggs. See In re Estate of Griggs, 2006 WL 3720309 at *1-2 (R.I. Super. Ct. Dec. 12, 2006). Along the way, in what appears to be an effort to exert control over Glenn Griggs, appellants removed him from his house and refused to disclose his location. On June 26, 2003, the Warwick Probate Court awarded temporary limited co-guardianship to Glenn Griggs’s business partner, David Heal, and to Dan Griggs. The appellants, however, refused to disclose Glenn Griggs’s whereabouts and moved, unsuccessfully, to vacate the decision of the probate court. It was not until July 3, 2003, after the Probate Court judge ordered appellants to retrieve Mr. Griggs and bring him before the court that appellants finally complied with the court’s order.', 'In 2005, the Probate Court adjudged appellants to be in contempt of its June 26, 2003 order. 2 That same year, the Probate Court appointed David Heal (guardian or appellee) as permanent guardian for Mr. Griggs. 3 For the next five years, the litigation dragged on, surviving Mr. Griggs, who “died out of it”4 in 2007. The appellants initiated successive (and unsuccessful) challenges and appeals in both the Probate Court and the Superior Court.', 'Ultimately, on December 13, 2010, the Probate Court entered a decision and order assessing “compensatory 1', 'For further details, see Griggs v.

Knopf, Inc. 1991) (1853).', '-2- contempt sanctions” against appellants totaling approximately $447,000 in the aggregate. Thereafter, each appellant filed a claim of appeal in the Warwick Probate Court. 5', 'In January 2011, each of the appellants filed a certified copy of her claim and the reasons of appeal in the Superior Court, together with a certified copy of the December 13, 2010 decision and order. No other portion of the record was submitted, and appellants moved for an extension of time to file the record. The guardian objected to any extension and requested that the appeals be dismissed. A hearing was held in Superior Court on January 24, 2011, at which time the trial justice denied the motion to extend time and dismissed the appeals for failure to timely provide the Probate Court record. The appellants each filed a notice of appeal to this Court on February 21, 2011. On April 27, 2011, appellee moved in Superior Court for execution on the Probate Court order awarding sanctions. The appellants objected to the motion, and on May 9, 2011 the Superior Court granted the motion and issued the execution.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court employs “a de novo standard ‘[w]hen reviewing an appeal based on an alleged error of law.’” Warwick Sewer Authority v.

The guardian argues that Nancy’s claim was filed beyond the twenty day jurisdictional requirement of G.L. 1956 § 33-23-1(a)(1) and that, therefore, her appeal was never properly before the Superior Court. Nancy responds that, notwithstanding the fact that the Warwick Probate Court was open for business on January 3, that date was a statutorily recognized state government holiday. In light of our opinion affirming the dismissal of all three appeals, we need not resolve this particular issue.', '-3-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, appellants argue that the trial justice erred in finding that they had not complied with the requirements of § 33-23-1 (setting forth timing requirements for probate appeals) and that, under § 33-23-1(c), he should have granted the extension in order to reach the merits of their cases. Further, appellants contend that the contempt finding and sanctions must be vacated because the Probate Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and because the order that they purportedly violated lacked specificity. The appellee counters that the trial justice was correct in dismissing the appeal because this Court’s precedent requires that a sufficient record be submitted before the Superior Court may allow additions to the record. The appellee further asserts that the Probate Court had inherent authority to impose sanctions and that the death of Glenn Griggs did not deprive the court of this authority. In addition, appellee moved to dismiss the instant appeals, arguing that appellants had failed to perfect their appeals because they did not submit an official transcript of the January 24, 2011 Superior Court hearing to this Court.', 'A', 'The Motion to Dismiss the Supreme Court Appeal', 'We first address the threshold issue of appellee’s motion to dismiss these appeals for failure to provide a transcript. Article I, Rule 10(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that “[w]ithin twenty (20) days after filing the notice of appeal the appellant shall order from the reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant deems necessary for inclusion in the record.” Here, appellants indicated in their notices of appeal that they would order a transcript, but they never did so.', 'This Court has previously stated:', '-4-', '“The deliberate decision to prosecute an appeal without', 'providing the Court with a transcript of the proceedings in the trial', 'court is risky business. Unless the appeal is limited to a challenge', 'to rulings of law that appear sufficiently on the record and the', 'party accepts the finding of the trial justice as correct, the appeal', 'must fail.” Adams v. Christie’s, Inc., 880 A.2d 774, 778 (R.I.', '2005) (quoting 731 Airport Associates, LP v. H & M Realty', 'Associates, LLC, 799 A.2d 279, 282 (R.I. 2002)). Moreover, Article I, Rule 11(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure requires an appellant to “take any other action necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and transmit the record.” Rule 11(b) devolves to the clerk of the trial court the obligation to transmit the record “[w]hen the record is complete for purposes of the appeal.” Thus, it is the responsibility of an appellant who fails to order a transcript after indicating that he or she would do so, to inform the Court that he or she will not order a transcript, so that the clerk may “assemble and transmit the record.” See Sentas v. Sentas, 911 A.2d 266, 270 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Rule 11(a)); Procopio v. PRM Concrete Corp., 711 A.2d 650, 651 (R.I. 1998) (mem.).', 'While it is regrettable that appellants did not inform the court that they had decided not to order a transcript, that failure does not prevent us from reaching the merits in this particular case. We are satisfied that these appeals concern a question of law that appears sufficiently on the Superior Court record. We therefore deny appellee’s motion to dismiss this appeal.', 'B', 'The Dismissal of the Superior Court Appeal', 'Section 33-23-1(a)(2) requires that, within thirty days of the entry of the order appealed from “the appellant shall file in the superior court a certified copy of the claim and record and the reasons of appeal specifically stated * * *.” Here, no portion of the record other than the December 13, 2010 decision and order was provided to the Superior Court. Instead, appellants,', '-5- citing § 33-23-1(c), filed a motion to extend time to file the probate record. Section 33-23-1(c) states:', '“If the appellant ordered the transcript or tape recording as', 'the case may be from the probate clerk within the twenty (20) day', 'deadline of subsection (a)(1) and the transcript is unavailable for', 'filing within the thirty (30) day deadline of subsection (a)(2), the', 'superior court on appellant’s motion shall grant an extension of', 'such additional time reasonably necessary to complete the record.” The trial justice found that § 33-23-1(c), by its plain language, applies to transcripts of proceedings.', 'In argument before the trial justice, appellants sought to extend the term “transcript” to apply to the entire record of the case. However, the definition of “transcript” simply does not stretch so far.', 'In Griggs v. Estate of Griggs, 845 A.2d 1006, 1010 (R.I. 2004) (Griggs I), we stated: “A Superior Court justice’s authority to permit additions or corrections to the record is contingent on the appealing party’s filing a substantial record at the outset. The transmitted record is sufficient if it will allow the Superior Court to pass on each issue raised in the appeal.” Here, appellants did not merely fail to produce a transcript of the Probate Court proceedings; they failed to produce anything beyond that court’s decision and their own reasons for appeal. The appellants claimed that, because appellee would not stipulate to a record, they would have had to submit the entire record of these cases, amounting to thousands of pages and boxes of documents—far more than the Warwick Probate Court clerk’s office could hope to produce before the deadline. The trial justice noted that “[t]he deadline[s] of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) * * * are jurisdictional and may not be extended by either the probate court or the superior court, except for purposes of extending the time to file the transcript under subsection (c).”', 'While parties are always presumed to be on notice of the law, rarely do we see a case where clear precedent can be found within the parties’ own case history. In Griggs I, 845 A.2d', '-6- at 1010, we held that “[a]lthough it is within a [s]uperior [c]ourt justice’s discretion to enlarge the record, we conclude that * * * the * * * justice erred in allowing the additions by failing to determine, as a preliminary matter, whether petitioners had filed enough of the record from the Probate Court to perfect the appeal.”', 'Each appellant filed her claim and reasons for the appeal in the Superior Court, yet failed to file any part of the record and instead moved for an extension of time to file the record. In Griggs I, 845 A.2d at 1010, we foresaw just such a situation and addressed it, saying “[s]ection 33-23-1(b) should not be interpreted as a loophole allowing inattentive parties to perfect the appeal by initially supplying the court with a smattering of documents, then supplementing the record later in the proceedings.” We went on to state that “[o]nly after a substantial portion of the relevant documents have been filed will the appeal be perfected, and a motion justice then can consider whether any additions or corrections are needed.” Griggs I, 845 A.2d at 1010. Here, appellants failed to file a substantial portion of the record. The trial justice then correctly held that § 33-23-1(c) applied only to transcripts and that he did not have the authority to extend the deadline to file the record.', 'We discern no error in the trial justice’s dismissal of the appellants’ appeals. Although we harbor considerable concerns about the authority of the Probate Court to continue to preside over a guardianship proceeding for a long-dead ward, as well as the magnitude of the sanctions imposed without the benefit of a jury trial, we are unable to conduct any meaningful review due to the lack of a record before us. 6 Nor can we address whether the Superior Court properly issued the execution while this matter was on appeal, as that issue is not properly before us. 6', 'We note, however, that the Probate Court judge said in his decision assessing the amount of sanctions that appellants were given the opportunity to review and challenge the evidence', '-7-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.

67,": of the Joyce DiPippo Living Trust dated June 10, 1992 et al. v. : Louis Sperling et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Joyce DiPippo (Mrs. DiPippo) and Trudy DiPippo (collectively, plaintiffs) 1 appeal from a Superior Court judgment, after a bench trial, in favor of the defendants, Louis and Rebecca Sperling, in this adverse-possession action. The plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred in holding that an agreement, in which the Sperlings granted Mrs. DiPippo permission to place a hammock on a disputed parcel of land, was a concession to the defendants’ superior title in that land. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Although the case caption reads “Joyce DiPippo, Individually and as Trustee * * *,” the original complaint was amended to include Joyce DiPippo’s daughter, Trudy DiPippo, as an additional plaintiff.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiffs own property at 90 Overhill Road in Warwick, Rhode Island, which is described as Assessor’s Plat No. 219, lot No. 9. Joyce DiPippo purchased the property with her then-husband, Robert, in 1972. 2 In 2002, defendants purchased property at 86 D’Agnillo Drive in Warwick, Rhode Island, which is described as Assessor’s Plat No. 219, lot No. 172. The defendants’ property abuts the southern boundary of plaintiffs’ property. The parcel of land at issue is an area, irregular in both shape and contour, located on the northernmost portion of defendants’ surveyed property. 3 The precise boundaries of the disputed area have not been determined. The plaintiffs assert that, since 1972, they have used this area as their own, in the belief that it is part of their yard. Specifically, plaintiffs placed an inflatable children’s pool, built a “tree fort,” and hung a hammock from trees in the disputed area.', 'In March 2003, after purchasing the property on D’Agnillo Drive, defendants arranged to have their property surveyed and staked. One of the stakes denoting the northern border of the Sperling property was placed within the disputed area. Mrs. DiPippo’s son, Alexander, testified that he removed the stake, stating that he thought it had been placed “in the middle of my yard.” Mr. Sperling testified that he spoke to Mrs. DiPippo for the first time on or about March 14, 2', 'Joyce and Robert DiPippo owned the property until their divorce. Mrs. DiPippo became the sole owner in 1986. In 2000, she transferred the property to herself as trustee of a revocable trust. In 2008, she conveyed the property to Trudy DiPippo, reserving a life estate for herself. 3', 'Although plaintiffs consistently use the term “the cleared area” in their filings, defendants assert that the area is not cleared and remains woodland. The photographs offered as exhibits show trees and brush consistent with a natural woodland. While there was discussion during the trial about taking a view of the property, the record does not reveal whether the court took such a view. Accordingly, on such limited information, this Court will decline to use the term “cleared area” and will instead refer to it only as the “disputed area.”', '-2- 2003. He said that Mrs. DiPippo inquired about the surveyor’s stake and asked if Mr. Sperling intended to erect a fence across the rear of the property. Mr. Sperling recalled responding that he did not intend to do so, and asked why that would be a concern. He testified that Mrs. DiPippo replied that she had placed her hammock there and that the prior owner “had told her it was okay.” Mr. Sperling further testified that “she wanted to know if I would let her do it.”', 'Mrs. DiPippo also testified about meeting Mr. Sperling for the first time “a couple of days after [her] son broke off the stake.” She recalled Mr. Sperling telling her that he was now the owner of the land and testified that she “probably stood there with [her] mouth open.” When asked whether she told Mr. Sperling what she believed the status of the land to be, Mrs. DiPippo testified that she told him: “I have no idea what you’re talking about. I totally have to process this. This is news to me.” Although she did not testify to making any claim of ownership during that conversation, she recalled feeling “like someone * * * told you after 35 years it’s not yours. It’s just too much to process, too much to absorb and I couldn’t absorb it at that point.”', 'Mr. Sperling testified that he told Mrs. DiPippo that he would allow her to hang the hammock and then, at a subsequent meeting, stated that he would give permission in exchange for her executing an indemnification agreement. The indemnification was not executed until 2005, and during the interim, Mrs. DiPippo did not hang her hammock in the disputed area.', 'In January 2004, defendants sent a letter to several neighbors along their northern border, including Mrs. DiPippo. The letter referred to a stone wall at the rear edge of the property, that “marks the property line” between defendants and the neighboring lots to the north, and noted that “part of [the defendants’] property may have been used by a neighbor not being aware that the property line stops at the stone wall. This may particularly be the case where the stone wall', '-3- has disappeared.” 4 In the letter, defendants also stated that they would not permit further use of their property without “specific written permission,” but they offered to consider requests for such permission. Additionally, the letter advised that defendants intended to file a notice to contest adverse possession. On March 31, 2004, defendants recorded said notice in the Warwick Records of Land Evidence.', 'On April 13, 2004, Mrs. DiPippo sent a letter to defendants asserting that she had “always believed that [she] own[ed] the property in dispute.” Mrs. DiPippo proposed meeting to “discuss ways that the case can be resolved,” and noted that any such meeting “would be considered a settlement discussion pursuant to Rule 408 [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence].” Although the parties met, no settlement was reached.', 'In the spring of 2005, there was further discussion about Mrs. DiPippo putting up the hammock, and Mr. Sperling reminded her that he would need an indemnification agreement. When Mrs. DiPippo realized that defendants had not received one from her attorney, she invited Mr. Sperling to draft an agreement.', 'Finally, on April 22, 2005, Mrs. DiPippo signed an indemnification agreement that Mr. Sperling had drafted. The document states as follows:', '“This letter will serve to confirm our understanding regarding our', 'permission for you to put up and use a hammock amongst trees on', 'our property.', '“On Tuesday, April 19, 2005, you indicated to me that you had', 'informed your attorney to present us with your acknowledgement', 'that we had given you permission to place a hammock on a portion', 'of our property which abuts your adjoining property in exchange', 'for your agreement to indemnify us for any injury which may', 'occur to you or your guests from the use of the hammock placed', 'on our property. I indicated to you that I had not received any such', 'notification from your attorney. I further indicated to you that you 4', 'The stone wall referenced in the letter runs along the southern boundary of four rectangular lots north of defendants’ property, but there is a gap in the wall behind plaintiffs’ property.', '-4-', 'could place the hammock on our property pending acceptable', 'notification from you or your attorney regarding indemnification.', '“This letter will serve as notification of our intent to grant you', 'limited access and use of a portion of our property for the purpose', 'of placing and using a hammock on our property in exchange for', 'your signed indemnification as noted below.', '“You also indicated to me a desire to obtain permission for your', 'son to place a hammock on our property should you decide to sell', 'your property to him in the future. Our willingness to grant', 'permission to your son should he become the owner of the', 'property will be dependent on his willingness to indemnify us at', 'the time he becomes an owner of the property and his agreement to', 'the terms of usage as outlined in this letter.', '“Of course, circumstances may change and you may, in the future,', 'not wish to provide us with indemnification. Therefore, it is', 'understood and agreed that either party may terminate this', 'agreement at any time and for any reason upon written notice to', 'the other party. Should you withdraw your indemnification or', 'should you use the property for any purpose or reason other than', 'the placement and use of a hammock, permission to use our', 'property will be immediately withdrawn. It is understood that you', 'cannot cut any trees or shrubs that are on our property nor may you', 'place any other structure or object on our property other than the', 'said hammock.', '“It is further understood and agreed that you will indemnify us and', 'hold us harmless for any injury which you or your guests may', 'sustain while using the hammock on our property.', '“By signing and returning a copy of this letter to me, we can avoid', 'any further discussion of the matter and avoid additional and', 'unnecessary attorney fees. Enjoy your summer and happy', 'swinging.” Mrs. DiPippo returned the signed letter to defendants along with a handwritten note stating: “What a perfect solution!! I’m happy to sign the agreement * * * I feel good about resolving this, as I’m sure you do. Looking forward to waving hello at you, while swinging in my hammock!!” Neither document contains a reservation of rights, or any mention of plaintiffs’ claim to the property.', '-5-', 'In the fall of 2005, Mrs. DiPippo alerted defendants that one of the trees to which she affixed her hammock was leaning at a 45-degree angle. In a handwritten letter dated November 17, 2005, Mrs. DiPippo offered to pay $100 toward removal of the tree, “even though I’ve since learned that I have no responsibility to do so.” On June 11, 2006, Mrs. DiPippo again wrote to defendants, expressing increasing concern about “the huge tree in your yard that is now perched very precariously on my tree” and the fear that her tree could collapse onto the roof of her house. Mr. Sperling responded in a letter dated June 13, 2006, noting that the “branches and the like which hang over your property are subject to being cut and trimmed by you.” The letter describes the property line stating, “[i]f you stand where the stone wall used to be and look up, you can see a bulge in the tree. Everything to the left of the bulge is over your property * * *.” Finally, the letter states that if, after the overhanging branches are trimmed, the trunk still looks unsteady, defendants “will, of course, deal with that expense.”', 'In December 2006, Mrs. DiPippo left Mr. Sperling a voicemail message informing him that she had found someone to cut the branches on her property. In his response, Mr. Sperling reiterated that Mrs. DiPippo was not authorized to remove any part of the tree trunk that remained on his property. The tree, which previously had held up one side of Mrs. DiPippo’s hammock, fell over in early 2007. Mrs. DiPippo arranged to have the fallen tree removed, prompting defendants to send a letter directing her to cease cutting “wood that is not yours to cut” and reiterating that “you cannot enter the property, cut trees, remove shrubs or even rake leaves without explicit permission.” Mrs. DiPippo complied.', 'In 2008, Mrs. DiPippo installed security lights on her property that shone toward defendants’ house. That November, defendants erected a fence approximately five and a half feet inside the northern boundary of their own property. The plaintiffs filed the instant action for', '-6- adverse possession on July 10, 2009, and moved for a preliminary injunction. The motion for preliminary injunction was heard on August 26, 2009, and the hearing justice found that plaintiffs failed to establish either a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm and thus he denied the motion. The case proceeded to a bench trial and was heard on December 6-8, 2010. 5 On July 14, 2011, judgment entered in favor of defendants. The plaintiffs timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court will “give much deference ‘to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil case.’” McGarry v. Coletti, 33 A.3d 140, 144 (R.I. 2011) (quoting B.S. International Ltd. v. JMAM, LLC, 13 A.3d 1057, 1062 (R.I. 2011)).

Morrow, 11 A.3d 82 (R.I. 2011), when he found that the 2005 agreement between the parties allowing Mrs. DiPippo to put up a hammock was an acknowledgment by plaintiffs of defendants’ superior title. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the indemnification letter was a settlement agreement entered into after a dispute had arisen and thus cannot serve as evidence 5', 'The Superior Court justice who presided at the trial was not the same justice who heard the motion for preliminary injunction.', '-7- that plaintiffs conceded defendants’ ownership of the disputed area. The defendants respond that Mrs. DiPippo asked Mr. Sperling for permission to put up her hammock in 2003, well before defendants’ notice of intent to dispute adverse possession. The defendants argue that, because this request was made prior to any dispute, it cannot be construed to be a settlement. Further, defendants note that Mrs. DiPippo did not reserve any rights to maintain an adverse-possession claim when she signed the 2005 agreement. Accordingly, defendants assert that the trial justice was correct in holding that plaintiffs did not possess the disputed property under a claim of right. Alternatively, defendants argue that the most plaintiffs can claim is a seasonal easement to use a hammock in the disputed area—an easement that was extinguished when one of the “hammock trees” fell.', 'In Rhode Island, to obtain property by adverse possession, 6 a claimant must prove “actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive use of property under a claim of right for at least a period of ten years.” Cahill, 11 A.3d at 88. “The party who asserts that adverse possession has occurred must establish the required elements by strict proof, that is, proof by 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-7-1 states,', '“Where any person or persons, or others from whom he,', 'she, or they derive their title, either by themselves, tenants or', 'lessees, shall have been for the space of ten (10) years in the', 'uninterrupted, quiet, peaceful and actual seisin and possession of', 'any lands, tenements or hereditaments for and during that time,', 'claiming the same as his, her or their proper, sole and rightful', 'estate in fee simple, the actual seisin and possession shall be', 'allowed to give and make a good and rightful title to the person or', 'persons, their heirs and assigns forever; and any plaintiff suing for', 'the recovery of any such lands may rely upon the possession as', 'conclusive title thereto, and this chapter being pleaded in bar to', 'any action that shall be brought for the lands, tenements or', 'hereditaments, and the actual seisin and possession being duly', 'proved, shall be allowed to be good, valid and effectual in law for', 'barring the action.”', '-8- clear and convincing evidence.” Id. (quoting Corrigan v. Nanian, 950 A.2d 1179, 1179 (R.I. 2008) (mem.)).', 'The trial justice made specific findings that plaintiffs’ use of the disputed property was actual and continuous, open and notorious, and exclusive throughout the ten-year statutory period. At issue here is the element of hostility. “[T]o require adverse possession under a claim of right is the same as requiring hostility, in that both terms simply indicate that the claimant is holding the property with an intent that is adverse to the interests of the true owner.” Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003) (quoting 16 Richard R. Powell and Michael Allan Wolf Powell on Real Property, § 91.05[4] at 91-29 (2000)). A possessor’s use is hostile if it is “a use ‘inconsistent with the right of the owner, without permission asked or given, * * * such as would entitle the owner to a cause of action against the intruder [for trespass].’” Id. (quoting Powell on Real Property, § 91.05[1] at 91-23). The trial justice found that plaintiffs failed to prove their use was hostile because they made “several arrangements with [defendants] that illustrated [their] acceptance of [d]efendants’ superior title.” Accordingly, he found that Mrs. DiPippo was “well aware that her interest in the disputed property was subservient to that of the [d]efendants.” Although the trial justice made few specific findings of fact, in making this determination it is apparent that he relied on testimony about discussions in which Mrs. DiPippo requested permission to place a hammock on the disputed property, as well as the 2005 indemnification agreement. We shall address each of these bases separately.', 'A', 'The 2003 Discussion', 'In Cahill, 11 A.3d at 93, this Court held that “the objective manifestations that another has superior title, made after the statutory period and not made to settle an ongoing dispute, are', '-9- poignantly relevant to the ultimate determination of claim of right and hostile possession during the statutory period.” Here, the trial justice found that “[p]laintiff made several arrangements with the owners of the property neighboring hers that illustrated her acceptance of [d]efendants’ superior title.” Because the trial justice found that plaintiffs’ acts of actual and continuous possession related to the tree fort, inflatable swimming pool, and children’s play in the disputed area—acts which occurred decades before defendants purchased the property, it is clear that the “arrangements” between plaintiffs and defendants were made after the ten-year statutory period had run. See G.L. 1956 § 34-7-1.', 'The plaintiffs argue that the “arrangements” were made to settle an ongoing dispute, and thus cannot be considered in determining whether Mrs. DiPippo’s possession was under claim of right. To support this argument, plaintiffs aver that defendants’ January 10, 2004 letter advising that they would file a notice to contest adverse possession marks the beginning of the ongoing dispute. Accordingly, they assert that the signed agreement between the parties, dated April 22, 2005, is not an objective manifestation of defendants’ superior title, but rather, is an attempt to settle an ongoing dispute.', 'It is clear, however, that the trial justice did not base his decision solely on the 2005 agreement.', 'The trial justice also found “that there are declarations by [p]laintiff[s] of [d]efendants’ superior title. When the Sperlings became the owners of the property [Mrs. DiPippo] asked for permission to anchor the hammock in the disputed area. Defendants allowed her to do so, conditioned on an indemnification agreement * * *.” While the indemnification agreement is dated 2005, both Mrs. DiPippo and Mr. Sperling testified to having a conversation in 2003, although their testimony regarding the content of the 2003 discussion differs. After carefully reviewing the trial justice’s decision, we are satisfied that he was not clearly wrong in', '- 10 - finding that Mrs. DiPippo “acknowledged that someone else had superior title over the disputed property by asking for permission” to use the area shortly after the Sperlings purchased the property.', 'B', 'The 2005 Agreement', 'Even assuming, arguendo, that the trial justice relied solely on the post-dispute 2005 indemnification agreement, we remain unconvinced that this agreement represents an attempt to settle the ongoing dispute over ownership of the property.', 'The plaintiffs characterize the agreement as one “whereby [Mrs. DiPippo] agreed to treat the disputed property as [defendants’], not hers, provided the Sperlings allowed her to place her hammock on the disputed property, and provided further that she indemnify them for any claims.” The assertion that Mrs. DiPippo “agreed to treat the disputed property” as the Sperlings’ is plainly not reflected in the indemnification agreement.', 'The agreement contains no fewer than eleven references by defendants to the disputed area as “our property”; two of those references serve to distinguish the disputed area from “your property.” Further, the statement that Mrs. DiPippo signed at the bottom of that correspondence reads:', '“I, Joyce DiPippo, hereby agree to the terms set forth in', 'this letter and acknowledge that I have obtained the permission of', 'Louis and Rebecca Sperling to place and use a hammock on their', 'property. I further agree to indemnify them and hold them', 'harmless for any injury which may occur to myself or to my guests', 'while using the hammock on their property.” At no point in the document is there any reference to plaintiffs having any claim to the disputed area or to their agreeing to “treat the disputed property” as belonging to defendants. The letter', '- 11 - contains no reservation of rights; and, importantly, plaintiffs do not promise not to file a claim in exchange for permission to use the property.', 'The plaintiffs also state that they entered the agreement “hoping that it would bring peace and closure to the boundary dispute.” There is, however, no mention of any such dispute within the document. Absent a promise to refrain from litigation over the disputed area, we fail to see how this letter could operate to resolve the dispute over the property. Rather, we read the agreement as a straightforward grant of permission to use the land for a very limited purpose (hanging a hammock) in exchange for a promise to hold the landowner-defendants harmless from any injury that might result from that use.', 'Accordingly, because we do not find that the 2005 agreement was entered into to settle an ongoing dispute, it was not error for the trial justice to consider it as an objective manifestation of the defendants’ superior title.', 'As we held in Cahill, 11 A.3d at 93, although such a manifestation does not automatically invalidate the plaintiffs’ claim, it is “poignantly relevant to the ultimate determination of claim of right and hostile possession during the statutory period.” The clear and convincing standard presents a high hurdle to a would-be adverse possessor; the evidence proffered in this case fails to meet that hurdle.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

68,"Anthony Bucci et al. : v. : Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. In this case, we are asked to determine whether a nominee of a mortgage lender, who holds only legal title to the mortgage, but who is not the holder of the accompanying promissory note, may exercise the statutory power of sale and foreclose on the mortgage. On May 15, 2007, Anthony Bucci borrowed $249,900 from Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman Brothers) to finance the purchase of a home, and he signed an adjustable rate note (note) that evidenced the debt. On that same date, he and his wife, Stephanie Bucci (collectively, the Buccis or plaintiffs) executed a mortgage on the property that secured the loan. 1 Like many loans in the modern era of lending, even though the note was made payable to the lender—in this case Lehman Brothers—the mortgage was granted to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for the lender and the lender’s successors and assigns. In October 2008, the plaintiffs ceased making loan payments, thereby defaulting on the note. Sometime thereafter, MERS initiated foreclosure proceedings. A foreclosure sale was scheduled, but the day before it was to take place, the plaintiffs commenced an action seeking a 1', 'It appears from the trial justice’s decision and from the copies of the note and mortgage in the record that, although both plaintiffs are named in the mortgage deed, only Anthony Bucci signed the note that evidenced the loan. However, this fact does not affect our decision in this case.', '-1- declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, in which they sought to prevent MERS from exercising the power of sale contained in the mortgage. The trial justice denied the plaintiffs’ request, and judgment was entered on behalf of the defendants on September 21, 2009. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'MERS', 'To begin, we believe that it is important to an understanding of this case to set forth a description of MERS and the role that it plays in the mortgage industry. In 1993, several major participants in the lending community collaborated to form a national electronic registration system that would track the transfer of ownership interests in residential loans (the MERS® System). MERSCORP, Inc. v. Romaine, 861 N.E.2d 81, 83 (N.Y. 2006). The MERS® System was developed to allow for more efficient transfers of those interests in the primary and secondary mortgage markets. Jackson v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 770 N.W.2d 487, 490 (Minn. 2009).', 'The primary mortgage market consists mainly of home loans that are made to consumers. Jackson, 770 N.W.2d at 490. However, the loans are often “bundled” and sold to institutional investors on the secondary mortgage market. Id.', 'In turn, the institutional investors often repackage and resell the loans or securitize them and sell shares of the resulting securities. Id. According to MERS, prior to the creation of its registration system, the constant buying and selling of mortgage-backed loans became costly and time-consuming, because each transfer', '-2- required that an assignment of the mortgage be recorded in the local land evidence records. It also became difficult to determine what entity owned the beneficial interests in these loans at any given time, because those interests were bought and sold with such frequency, often leading to recording errors. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. Bellistri, 2010 WL 2720802 at *7 (E.D. Mo. July 1, 2010). The MERS® System was developed to bring efficiency and order to this increasingly complex industry. Jackson, 770 N.W.2d at 490.', 'In order to take advantage of the MERS® System, lenders and other entities must become members of MERSCORP, Inc. (MERSCORP), the corporation that owns the system. MERSCORP is also the parent company of defendant MERS. Bellistri, 2010 WL 2720802 at *6. In a typical MERS transaction, when a loan is made by a member of MERSCORP, the member will be designated as the lender in the promissory note, and MERS will be named in the mortgage as the mortgagee, acting as nominee for the lender and the lender’s successors or assigns. Jackson, 770 N.W.2d at 490.', 'Whenever a note is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another MERSCORP member, MERS remains as the mortgagee of record. As a result, there is no need to record an assignment of the mortgage in the land evidence records. Id. It is only when a loan is transferred to a nonmember that an assignment of the mortgage must be executed and recorded. Id. at 491. Consequently, loans can be transferred more quickly and economically, and each transfer can be tracked on the MERS® System. 2 Id. The typical MERS loan, as just described, was exactly the type of transaction that occurred between plaintiffs and defendants in the matter that confronts this Court. 2', 'There are obvious benefits that flow from the MERS® System; however, there are also certain drawbacks, such as a lack of transparency, because transfers between members are generally not known to anyone outside the system.

Specifically, plaintiffs launched a fusillade of claims, asking the court to declare that: (1) Lehman Brothers was the lender relative to this matter; (2) MERS was not a lender relative to this matter; (3) pursuant to the loan documents, only the lender could invoke the statutory power of sale contained in the mortgage; (4) the pending foreclosure violated the terms and conditions of the loan documents and Rhode Island statutory law; (5) the pending foreclosure be ordered cancelled; (6) plaintiffs could not legally designate MERS as nominee of the lender; (7) there was no proof of agency between MERS and Lehman Brothers; and (8) Aurora, as a servicer, was not allowed by statute to foreclose on a mortgage that it did not own. The plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief to preclude defendants from exercising the statutory power of sale contained in the mortgage.', 'The plaintiffs argued that the language of the mortgage did not authorize MERS to foreclose. Specifically, they pointed to a provision that said “Lender * * * may invoke the STATUTORY POWER OF SALE,” and they asserted that this language precluded MERS from foreclosing because the mortgage defined Lehman Brothers as the lender, not MERS. Furthermore, they asserted that Lehman Brothers never designated MERS as its nominee because, although the mortgage named MERS as nominee, Lehman Brothers never signed the mortgage.', 'Additionally, plaintiffs argued that MERS was prohibited from foreclosing by G.L. 1956 §§ 34-11-21 and 34-11-22. 4 Specifically, they contended that § 34-11-22 permitted only a 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-11-21, entitled “Statutory mortgage condition,” provides:', '“The following condition shall be known as the ‘statutory', 'condition’, and may be incorporated in any mortgage by reference:', '“(Condition)', '-6- mortgagee to exercise the power of sale and that MERS was merely a “nominee-mortgagee,” an ill-defined entity that lacked the authority to foreclose.

Because MERS was not the lender, and because MERS did not receive principal and interest payments, plaintiffs argued, it could not be the mortgagee under § 34-11-21.', 'The defendants responded by filing objections to plaintiffs’ prayers for declaratory and injunctive relief. They also filed a memorandum in which they argued that MERS was permitted to foreclose by the clear language of the mortgage and that its doing so would not violate the statutes cited by plaintiffs. For further support, defendants provided the court with an affidavit of Cheryl R. Marchant, a Vice President of Aurora, the servicer of the note.', 'On July 9, 2009, the trial justice ordered that the scheduled foreclosure be stayed until further order of the court. On July 14, 2009, he conducted a hearing on the issue of whether MERS had the legal right to foreclose the mortgage by exercising the statutory power of sale contained therein, or whether injunctive relief should be granted to enjoin defendants from foreclosing. 5', 'D', 'Superior Court Decision', 'The trial justice filed a written decision on August 25, 2009. In his decision, he distilled the controversy to two questions of law: (1) whether MERS had the contractual right to foreclose under the note and mortgage; and (2) whether MERS had the statutory authority to do so. As to the first issue, the trial justice found that plaintiffs, by executing the mortgage deed, “specifically 5', 'The matter was originally set down as a hearing on an application for preliminary injunction; however, the trial justice consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits under Rule 65(a)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', '-8- granted ‘the Statutory Power of Sale’ to MERS, as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns.” The trial justice quoted the provision of the mortgage that said that “‘if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) has the right to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property * * *.’” The trial justice concluded that the language in the mortgage, cited by plaintiffs, which provided the lender with the right to invoke the statutory power of sale, did “not negate the previous language in the Mortgage directly granting MERS * * * the right to” foreclose and sell the property.', 'Although Lehman Brothers no longer held the note at the time this case was heard in the Superior Court, the trial justice nonetheless found that MERS had the contractual authority to foreclose because the mortgage named MERS as the nominee of Lehman Brothers and its “successors and assigns.” The trial justice, relying on the affidavit of Cheryl R. Marchant, found that “‘[t]he Note ha[d] been indorsed in blank and [wa]s currently held by LaSalle [Bank, NA (LaSalle)] as custodian for the beneficial owner of the Note * * *.’” He then found that LaSalle was acting in a trustee capacity for the owner of the note and that that owner was indeed a “successor or assign” of Lehman Brothers. See G.L. 1956 § 6A-3-205(b) (“When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.”); G.L. 1956 § 6A-1-201(b)(5) (“‘Bearer’ means a person in possession of a negotiable instrument, document of title, or certificated security that is payable to bearer or indorsed in blank.”). Therefore, the trial justice concluded that MERS was the mortgagee as nominee for the current beneficial owner of the note.', 'Moreover, although Lehman Brothers never signed the mortgage designating MERS as its nominee, the trial justice nonetheless found that it had authorized MERS to act in this', '-9- capacity when it disbursed the loan funds to plaintiffs. The trial justice reasoned that “[i]f Lehman [Brothers] had not approved of MERS acting as its nominee, [it] would not have disbursed the loan proceeds to the Buccis.” 6', 'The trial justice then went on to address plaintiffs’ statutory arguments. First, he found that § 34-11-22—which sets forth the statutory power of sale and allows “the mortgagee * * * to sell” the mortgaged property in the event of a default—did not prohibit MERS from exercising that power because the mortgage named MERS as the mortgagee. Furthermore, he said, “[t]he fact that MERS acts in a nominee capacity for the lender and the lender’s successors and assigns does not diminish MERS’s role as the mortgagee nor is there created a new legal term ‘nominee- mortgagee.’”', 'The trial justice then addressed § 34-11-21, which says that “the mortgagor * * * shall pay to the mortgagee * * * the principal and interest of th[e] * * * promissory note,” and found that, despite that statutory phrasing, nothing in that section prohibited MERS from foreclosing on the mortgage. He concluded that the overly literal reading of the statute urged on him by plaintiffs would create an absurd result because it would prohibit loan servicers from collecting principal and interest payments on loans that were secured by real estate mortgages.', 'He reasoned that, “[c]learly, the General Assembly envisioned a role for mortgage servicers in the mortgage lending industry,” and he cited G.L. 1956 § 34-26-8(a)(4)—which includes “mortgage servicer” within the definition of “mortgagee” for purposes of that section—to support his reasoning. 6', 'At trial, the parties stipulated to the facts that were set forth in the Marchant affidavit. Significantly, in paragraph five of the affidavit, Marchant states that “[t]he Note has been indorsed in blank and is currently held by LaSalle as the custodian for the beneficial owner of the Note and/or its agents (including MERS) for whom MERS, in its capacity as mortgagee, is the nominee of the beneficial owner of the Note.”', '- 10 -', 'The trial justice determined that MERS was legally authorized to foreclose the Buccis’ mortgage by exercising the statutory power of sale. Therefore, he denied their request for declaratory and injunctive relief. Judgment was entered on September 21, 2009, and plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'To begin, we shall set out some well-settled principles of real property law regarding mortgages. Generally, there are two operative documents to a real estate loan transaction—a promissory note and a mortgage. The promissory note evidences the obligation of the borrower to repay the monies that have been lent, and the mortgage (or mortgage deed) acts as security for that debt.

First, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred when he found that defendants had the contractual authority to foreclose the Bucci mortgage because they argue that no agency or contractual relationship exists between MERS and the note holder. Second, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice erred when he found that defendants had the statutory authority to foreclose. 7 However, before this Court reaches these issues, we must address whether or not they have been rendered moot by events occurring after the trial justice handed down his decision. 7', 'At various points throughout the record and in the parties’ briefs, the issues before us are framed in terms of MERS’s “standing” to foreclose. We note, however, that the term “standing” refers to “[a] party’s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1536 (9th ed. 2009). Therefore, “[a] standing inquiry focuses on the party who is advancing the claim,” not the party defending against that claim. Bowen v. Mollis, 945 A.2d 314, 317 (R.I. 2008). In many cases involving MERS, the issue of standing is raised when MERS, acting as a plaintiff or a movant, is seeking to initiate judicial foreclosure proceedings, or is seeking relief from stay from a bankruptcy court so that a foreclosure may proceed. See, e.g., Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. Saunders, 2 A.3d 289, 293 (Me. 2010); In re Huggins, 357 B.R. 180, 181-82 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2006). However, in this case, MERS is a defendant, and therefore, we are not concerned about its standing to sue. Although the issue of MERS’s standing to commence judicial action may find its way to this Court in the future, that issue is not before us today. The salient issue that is before this Court is whether MERS has the legal authority to initiate a nonjudicial foreclosure and to exercise the power of sale.', '- 13 -', '1', 'Mootness', 'This Court has said “that the principle of mootness applies in actions for equitable relief, and that declaratory judgment will not be rendered on moot questions.” Boyer v.

Furthermore, defendants contend that MERS’s voluntary', '- 14 - cessation of foreclosure proceedings, through its internal policy change, is insufficient to render the case moot.', 'This Court has had few opportunities to address whether a defendant’s voluntary cessation of allegedly improper conduct will render a case moot, but we have discussed the issue on occasion.

We agree with the reasoning of the trial justice.', 'Within the mortgage is a provision that says: “Borrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS, (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS, with Mortgage Covenants upon the Statutory Condition and with the Statutory Power of Sale, the [mortgaged] property * * *.” The mortgage further provides:', '“Borrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title', 'to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security Instrument,', 'but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as', 'nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) has the', 'right to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not', 'limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property * * *.” These provisions are clear and leave no room for interpretation. The plaintiffs explicitly granted the statutory power of sale and the right to foreclose to MERS, and consequently, MERS has the contractual authority to exercise that right.', 'Although there is a later provision in the mortgage that empowers the “Lender” to invoke the statutory power of sale, in our opinion the trial justice was correct when he found that that', '- 17 - subsequent provision did “not negate the previous language in the [m]ortgage directly granting MERS * * * the right to” foreclose and sell the property. Thus, plaintiffs have agreed to grant MERS the power of sale.', 'ii', 'Relationship between MERS and the Note Holder', 'The plaintiffs next argue that Lehman Brothers never authorized MERS—contractually or as an agent—to act on its behalf because Lehman Brothers never signed the mortgage that named MERS as its nominee.', 'Furthermore, they contend that none of Lehman Brothers’ successors or assigns authorized MERS to act on their behalf. Therefore, they assert that the trial justice erred when he found that Lehman Brothers had properly designated MERS as its nominee. 10', 'While the contractual issue that was discussed in the previous section dealt with the relationship between plaintiffs and MERS, the argument discussed in this section focuses on the link between MERS and Lehman Brothers (and its successors and assigns).

See State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010) (“As this Court has made clear, the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial.” citing State v.

This section does not stand for the principle that an agency agreement relating to a mortgage and real estate loan must also be in writing.

However, in our opinion, this second relationship is as robust as the first. 11', 'A nominee relationship is akin to that of a principal and agent. See Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 826 F. Supp. 2d 352, 370 (D. Mass. 2011) (“The term ‘nominee’ in fact connotes a narrow form of agency * * *.”). We have held that the existence of an agency relationship is a question of fact. See, e.g., Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 966 A.2d 1262, 1268 (R.I. 2009) (“Whether an attorney-client relationship has formed is a question of fact governed by the principles of agency.”); Baker v.

See also 2A C.J.S. Agency § 5 at 309 (2003) (“The existence of an agency relationship is a question of fact under the circumstances of the particular case * * *.”). Although plaintiffs assert on appeal that no agency relationship between MERS and the note holder was proven at trial, it is our opinion that they waived this argument when their counsel agreed before the trial justice that there were no issues of fact in this case. See State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010) (“As this Court has made clear, the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial.” citing State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008)).', 'At trial in the Superior Court, the trial justice inquired as to whether the parties could agree on a stipulation of facts. The plaintiffs’ counsel responded by saying “I am willing to, I think, agree to most everything that [MERS and Aurora’s counsel] has presented from a factual point of view.” In addition, plaintiffs’ counsel said: “Maybe [the Marchant affidavit] would be 11', 'The plaintiffs do not challenge the third relationship in the triangle—the one between themselves and Lehman Brothers—on a contractual basis.', '- 19 - the basis for a factual agreement.” He later told the trial justice: “I’d think that my brother and I might be able to agree on Paragraphs 1 through 14” of that affidavit. In paragraph five of the affidavit, Marchant states that “[t]he Note has been indorsed in blank and is currently held by LaSalle as the custodian for the beneficial owner of the Note and/or its agents (including MERS) for whom MERS, in its capacity as mortgagee, is the nominee of the beneficial owner of the Note.” (Emphasis added.) Because the existence of an agency relationship is a question of fact and the parties, in accepting the Marchant affidavit, agreed that MERS was an agent and nominee of the beneficial owner of the note, plaintiffs may not seek a contrary holding from this Court. See Hagenberg, 879 A.2d at 441. Thus, plaintiffs have waived their agency argument. 12', '2', 'Statutory Authority for MERS to Foreclose and Exercise the Power of Sale', 'The plaintiffs offer an array of statutory arguments to support their position that MERS may not foreclose and exercise the statutory power of sale. First, they contend that G.L. 1956 § 18-10-1 precludes MERS from acting as a nominee for the beneficial owner of the note because it does not specifically authorize an entity such as MERS to hold a mortgage in a nominee capacity. Second, they argue that MERS is not a true mortgagee, but rather that it is a “nominee 12', 'Even if plaintiffs had not waived this argument, we nonetheless believe that it lacks merit because of MERSCORP’s rules of membership to which each member has agreed.

Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., 44 So.3d 618, 620 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (“The participants agree to appoint MERS to act as their common agent on all mortgages registered by them in the MERS system.”); MERSCORP, Inc. v. Romaine, 861 N.E.2d 81, 83 (N.Y. 2006) (“Members contractually agree to appoint MERS to act as their common agent on all mortgages they register in the MERS system.”). Because plaintiffs have conceded that an agency relationship existed when they agreed to that fact in the Marchant affidavit, and because we believe that the current beneficial owner of the note contractually agreed to allow MERS to foreclose on its behalf, we need not address plaintiffs other arguments regarding MERS’s contractual ability to be the nominee of the current owner of the note.', '- 20 - mortgagee,” which may not exercise the power of sale under § 34-11-22. Finally, they contend that MERS may not foreclose the mortgage because it is not the note holder, a transactional structure which plaintiffs maintain violates § 34-11-21, as well as many other statutes and case law. We shall address each of these arguments in turn.', 'i', 'Section 18-10-1', 'The plaintiffs cite to § 18-10-1 13 and argue that this section precludes MERS from acting as a nominee because MERS is neither a trust company nor a national banking association; however, they did not raise this statute in their argument before the trial justice.

Thus, they contend, MERS may not hold the mortgage as a nominee because the statute does not specifically grant it this right.

Therefore, we conclude that this section has no effect on MERS’s ability to act in a nominee capacity.', 'ii', 'Section 34-11-22 and MERS’s Status as Mortgagee', 'The plaintiffs next contend that MERS is not a true mortgagee, but rather that it is a “nominee mortgagee,” an amorphous creature that they maintain is not contemplated by any Rhode Island statute. Because MERS is not a true mortgagee, they argue, it may not exercise the statutory power of sale contained in § 34-11-22. The defendants counter by arguing that the power of sale is a right that is derived from contract, not from statute, and that § 34-11-22 merely regulates the manner in which that contractual right may be exercised; it does not, they maintain, dictate to whom or to what that power may be granted. Thus, they contend that the statute does not preclude MERS from being named as mortgagee. To put it succinctly, the question that is before this Court is whether MERS, acting in a nominee capacity for the owner of the note, can be a “mortgagee” as that term is used in § 34-11-22. We answer that question in the affirmative.', 'Section 34-11-22 provides, in pertinent part:', '“The following power shall be known as the ‘statutory power of', 'sale’ and may be incorporated in any mortgage by reference:', '“(Power)', '- 22 -', '“But if default shall be made in the performance or observance', 'of any of the foregoing or other conditions, or if breach shall be', 'made of the covenant for insurance contained in this deed, then it', 'shall be lawful for the mortgagee or his, her or its executors,', 'administrators, successors or assigns to sell * * * the premises', 'hereby granted or intended to be granted, or any part or parts', 'thereof, and the benefit and equity of redemption of the mortgagor', 'and his, her or its heirs, executors, administrators, successors and', 'assigns therein, at public auction * * *.” As defendants have correctly framed it, the right to exercise the power of sale in a mortgage is derived from contract, not statute. Thurber v. Carpenter, 18 R.I. 782, 784, 31 A. 5, 6 (1895) (describing the right to exercise the power of sale in a mortgage as “a matter of contract”); see also 55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages § 472 at 202 (2009) (“The power to sell under a mortgage or deed of trust is a matter of contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee under the conditions expressed in the instrument, and does not exist independently of it.”). Indeed, the contractual power of sale was recognized long before § 34-11-22 was enacted in 1927 (P.L. 1927, ch. 1056, § 14). See Thurber, 18 R.I. at 784-85, 31 A. at 6 (recognizing the power of sale in 1895).

Federal National Mortgage Association, 969 N.E.2d 1118, 1127 n.16 (Mass. 2012) (holding that, in Massachusetts, “the power [of sale] was given statutory form to shorten the length of mortgage instruments”).', 'We hold that the trial justice was correct when he found that “MERS is the mortgagee because the Mortgage executed by [plaintiffs] so states,” and “[t]he fact that MERS acts in a nominee capacity for the lender and the lender’s successors and assigns does not diminish MERS’s role as mortgagee[,] nor [does it] create[] a new legal term ‘nominee mortgagee,’” which has never been recognized by this Court. Therefore, MERS’s designation as nominee under the mortgage, albeit as the holder of legal title only, does not proscribe its authority to exercise the power of sale under the provisions of § 34-11-22.', 'iii', 'Whether the Mortgagee and the Note Owner Must be the Same Entity', 'In plaintiffs’ final line of argument, they concede that none of the statutes governing mortgagees explicitly prohibit MERS from foreclosing a mortgage and exercising the statutory power of sale. Rather, they contend that these statutes, as well as case law, implicitly prohibit MERS from doing so.', 'Specifically, they argue that the legislation regulating mortgagees', '- 24 - requires that there be unity in the note holder and mortgagee and that an entity like MERS, which holds the mortgage but not the note, is, as a result, prohibited from foreclosing on the mortgage. The defendants respond by reiterating that contractual agreements that are entered into voluntarily are to be enforced unless they clearly violate the law or some well-defined public policy. They contend that the mortgage in this case does neither.', 'Stated succinctly, this Court must decide whether our law would preclude a foreclosure by MERS because such foreclosures are not explicitly authorized, or, alternatively, whether our law would authorize them because they are not explicitly precluded. We believe the latter to be correct.', 'The plaintiffs cite a plethora of statutes that they contend support their position; each of those statutes employs the term “mortgagee.” 14 According to plaintiffs, all of these statutes either (1) place obligations on a “mortgagee” that MERS does not itself fulfill, but which are instead fulfilled by the note holder or a servicer; or (2) more generally imply that the mortgagee and note owner must be one and the same. We are fully aware that these statutes were originally enacted during a time when the mortgagee and note holder were almost always the same entity. In the modern world of lending, however, that is no longer the case. Thus, we are confronted with the same problem with which many courts before us have struggled—the “difficulty of attempting to shoehorn a modern innovative instrument of commerce into nomenclature and legal categories which stem essentially from the medieval English land law.” Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v.

Although the court held that an entity could foreclose if it held the mortgage and also either held', '- 26 -', 'Similarly, we do not believe that our General Assembly “intended to proscribe [the] application of general agency principles in the context of mortgage foreclosure sales.” Eaton, 969 N.E.2d at 1131. Therefore, we interpret the term “mortgagee” in our statutes in a similar fashion as did the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Thus, it is our opinion that none of the statutes that plaintiffs rely upon prohibit MERS from foreclosing on the Bucci mortgage, because in so doing, MERS would be acting as an agent on behalf of the note owner. Furthermore, under our reading of these statutes, any of the obligations placed upon a “mortgagee” may be fulfilled by either the mortgage holder or the owner of the note, provided that an agency relationship exists between the two.', 'To support their respective arguments regarding the various statutory provisions, the parties cite to case law that this Court will now address. Both plaintiffs and defendants point out the principle of property law providing that a mortgage and note are inseparable. See, e.g., Carpenter v. Longan, 83 U.S. 271, 274 (1872). The parties differ, however, in their assessment of whether the transactional structure in this case violates that principle. The plaintiffs contend that the rule is violated because MERS holds the mortgage but does not hold the note. By contrast, defendants argue that “MERS, as nominee, stands in the shoes of the note owner * * * with respect to the mortgage such that there is no separation.”', 'Black’s Law Dictionary 1149 (9th ed. 2009), defines nominee as “[a] person designated to act in place of another, usu[ally] in a very limited way” or “[a] party who holds bare legal title for the benefit of others or who receives and distributes funds for the benefit of others.” This the note or was “act[ing] on behalf of the note holder,” the court remanded the case to the Superior Court to determine if there was an agreement that the foreclosing party was in fact acting on the note holder’s behalf. Id. at 1134. As stated above, that analysis is unnecessary here because the parties, by accepting the Marchant affidavit, have agreed that an agency relationship was in place.', '- 27 - Court has embraced that definition in the past. See Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC v. 1889 Plainfield Pike Realty Corp., 994 A.2d 54, 56 n.5 (R.I. 2010). As nominee, MERS “holds bare legal title” to the mortgage and is acting on behalf of, and at the direction of, the note owner. On the other hand, the note owner retains the beneficial interest, or equitable title, in the mortgage. See Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, No. 12-1285, 2013 WL 563374 at *6-7 (1st Cir. Feb. 15, 2013); see also Jackson, 770 N.W.2d at 497 (“[O]ur decision turns, in part, on the difference between legal and equitable title to the security instrument in the property * * *.”). 16', 'Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has recognized the validity of this type of arrangement. Culhane, 2013 WL 563374 at *6-7. In that case, the court held that', '“there is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the common', 'arrangement whereby MERS holds bare legal title as mortgagee of', 'record and the noteholder alone enjoys the beneficial interest in the', 'loan.', '“The law contemplates distinctions between the legal interest in', 'a mortgage and the beneficial interest in the underlying debt.', 'These are distinct interests, and they may be held by different', 'parties.” Id. at *6. The court went on to further describe the legal arrangement between MERS and the lender.', '“Where—as at the inception of this loan—the mortgage and the', 'note are held by separate entities, an equitable trust is implied by', 'law. * * * Under such an arrangement, the mortgagee is an 16', 'We note that, unlike the Rhode Island General Assembly, the Legislature in Minnesota has enacted a statute that allows MERS to record certain documents as a nominee; however, the Supreme Court of Minnesota specifically said that it did not rely on that statute when rendering its decision in Jackson v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 770 N.W.2d 487, 494 (Minn. 2009) (“By passing the MERS statute, the legislature appears to have given approval to MERS’ operating system for purposes of recording. Nonetheless, the MERS statute is a recording statute, and we conclude that it does not change the requirements of the foreclosure by advertisement statute.”).', '- 28 -', 'equitable trustee who holds bare legal title to the mortgaged', 'premises in trust for the noteholder.” Id. at *7. Finally, the First Circuit concluded that “MERS’s role as mortgagee of record and custodian of the bare legal interest as nominee for the member-noteholder, and the member-noteholder’s role as owner of the beneficial interest in the loan, fit comfortably with each other and fit comfortably within the structure of Massachusetts mortgage law.” Id.', 'We believe that they reside comfortably within the law of our state as well.', 'Because the lender retained equitable title to the mortgage and passed that equitable title to each of its successors and assigns, including the current owner, the mortgage and note have never been separated as plaintiffs contend. Instead, the note and the equitable interest in the mortgage have always remained unified, and the mortgage has “followed the note.” Furthermore, the holder of the legal title to the mortgage—MERS—always has acted as an agent of the owner of the equitable title. In our opinion, this transactional structure is consistent with the law of this state.', 'Legal title refers to that which “evidences apparent ownership but does not necessarily signify full and complete title or a beneficial interest.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1622 (9th ed. 2009). Equitable title, on the other hand, pertains to that which “indicates a beneficial interest in property.” Id. We believe that MERS, as the holder of legal title, may be denominated as the mortgagee in the mortgage and may foreclose on behalf of the note owner. However, the proceeds from a foreclosure sale, which are part of the beneficial interest, belong to the owner of the note, who holds the equitable title. This view is supported by the Restatement (Third) Property (Mortgages) § 5.4(c) at 380 (1997), which provides that “[a] mortgage may be enforced only by, or in behalf of, a person who is entitled to enforce the obligation the mortgage secures.” (Emphasis added.)', '- 29 -', 'Comment e. to that section provides further guidance. That comment says that “in general a mortgage is unenforceable if it is held by one who has no right to enforce the secured obligation.” Restatement (Third) Property § 5.4, cmt. e. at 385. However,', '“This result is changed if [the mortgage holder] has authority', 'from [the note owner] to enforce the mortgage on [the note', 'owner]’s behalf. For example, [the mortgage holder] may be a', 'trustee or agent of [the note owner] with responsibility to enforce', 'the mortgage at [the note owner]’s direction. [The mortgage', 'holder]’s enforcement of the mortgage in these circumstances is', 'proper. * * * The trust or agency relationship may arise from the', 'terms of the assignment, from a separate agreement, or from other', 'circumstances. Courts should be vigorous in seeking to find such a', 'relationship, since the result is otherwise likely to be a windfall for', 'the mortgagor and the frustration of [the note owners]’s', 'expectation of security.” Id. at 385-86.', 'Here, MERS was attempting to enforce the mortgage “[o]n behalf of” the owner of the note, a party that is unquestionably “entitled to enforce the obligation the mortgage secures.” Restatement (Third) Property § 5.4(c) at 380. Therefore, we see no reason why MERS, as an agent of the owner of the note, cannot foreclose on behalf of that entity. 17 17', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the trial justice erred in not finding that MERS’s own regulations prohibit it from collecting money, holding promissory notes, or foreclosing in its own name. However, this argument is not developed in plaintiffs’ briefs. As this Court has said in the past, “[a] mere passing reference to an argument such as this, without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007). Nonetheless, even if this were properly before us, we fail to see any error in the trial justice’s decision. The issues raised by plaintiffs in this case involve MERS’s right to foreclose and exercise the statutory power of sale. Therefore, even if MERS decided not to go forward with a foreclosure sale based on its own regulations, the trial justice’s failure to make such a finding was not error.', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the trial justice erred by considering the economic impact that his decision would have if he had granted their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief. However, we see no merit in this contention either. After a thorough review of the record, we can find nothing that would suggest that the trial justice was swayed by any potential economic impacts of his decision. He never discussed any economic considerations in his decision, and all his conclusions are supported by sound legal analysis. Therefore, we can discern no error on the part of the trial justice regarding this argument.', '- 30 -', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, and the papers in this case may be remanded thereto.', '- 31 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Anthony Bucci et al. v.

69,State : v. : Curtis Isom.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Curtis Isom, appeals from an order of a Superior Court magistrate that denied his motion to vacate what he argued was an illegal sentence that was imposed after he admitted to violating the terms and conditions of his probation. On appeal, the defendant argues that: (1) the magistrate who revoked five years of his suspended sentence exceeded her authority in doing so; (2) the trial justice who subsequently heard the defendant’s motion to vacate that sentence erred when he declined to address the motion and instead returned it to the original sentencing magistrate to decide; (3) G.L. 1956 § 12-19-18 requires that the defendant’s sentence be quashed and his imprisonment terminated; and (4) even if the revocation of five years of the defendant’s suspended sentence was proper, the magistrate erroneously calculated the amount of time that remained suspended after those five years. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we conclude that subsequent events have caused much of this appeal to become moot, and we therefore decline to address its merits. However, the parties do not dispute that the magistrate erroneously calculated the time remaining on the defendant’s suspended sentence and probationary period, and, therefore, we remand the', '-1- matter to the Superior Court for a hearing to calculate the proper probationary period and suspended sentence remaining.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 28, 2000, defendant pled nolo contendere to one count of breaking and entering; he received a fifteen-year sentence, with two years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. Over the next several years, the state filed five notices of probation violation against defendant under Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 1 The first, filed on August 19, 2002, resulted in defendant being adjudged a violator of his probation, and three years of his remaining thirteen-year suspended sentence were revoked. The second, filed on March 14, 2006, resulted in another adjudication of violation against defendant, and fifty days more of his suspended sentence were revoked. No judgment was entered on the third notice of violation; however, a fourth was filed on December 31, 2008, alleging that defendant had violated G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2 by breaking and entering a residence. 2 It is the 1', 'Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, entitled “Revocation of Probation,” provides:', '“The court shall not revoke probation or revoke a suspension of', 'sentence or impose a sentence previously deferred except after a', 'hearing at which the defendant shall be afforded the opportunity to', 'be present and apprised of the grounds on which such action is', 'proposed. The defendant may be admitted to bail pending such', 'hearing. Prior to the hearing the State shall furnish the defendant', 'and the court with a written statement specifying the grounds upon', 'which action is sought under this subdivision.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-8-2 provides:', '“(a) Every person who shall break and enter at any time of the day', 'or night any dwelling house or apartment, whether the dwelling', 'house or apartment is occupied or not, or any outbuilding or garage', 'attached to or adjoining any dwelling house, without the consent of', 'the owner or tenant of the dwelling house, apartment, building, or', 'garage, shall be imprisoned for not less than two (2) years and not', '-2- disposition of that fourth violation that forms the basis of defendant’s appeal to this Court. 3', 'On March 12, 2009, a hearing was held in the Superior Court on the fourth alleged probation violation. At that hearing, defendant and the state agreed that defendant would admit to violating the terms and conditions of his probation and that five years of his suspended sentence would be revoked. Both sides also agreed that if the state were to pursue a case against defendant on the new charge of breaking and entering that had precipitated the notice of violation, then, in that case, the state would agree to a fifteen-year sentence on that charge, with five years to serve, concurrent with the five years that defendant would serve for the probation violation. Later, in open court, the following exchange occurred between defendant and the magistrate:', '“THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. Mr. Isom, did you have', 'plenty of time to discuss this with your lawyer.', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma’am.', 'more than ten (10) years for the first conviction, and for the second', 'and subsequent conviction shall be imprisoned for not less than', 'four (4) years and not more than fifteen (15) years, or fined not', 'more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both.', '“(b) Every person convicted pursuant to subsection (a) of this', 'section shall be ordered to make restitution to the victim of the', 'offense or to perform up to five hundred (500) hours of public', 'community restitution work, or both, or any combination of them', 'approved by the sentencing judge.

The restitution and/or public community restitution work', 'shall be in addition to any fine or sentence which may be imposed', 'and not in lieu of the fine or sentence.”', 'The fourth notice of violation was also filed in a separate matter in which defendant had pled nolo contendere to driving a vehicle without the consent of the owner in 2007, for which he received a three-year suspended sentence, with probation. That sentence was being served concurrently with the sentence that was imposed in 2000 for breaking and entering. 3', 'The fifth notice of violation was filed on July 13, 2011, and resulted in another adjudication of violation against defendant, and thirty months of his suspended sentence were revoked.', '-3-', '“THE COURT: And you understand that you have a right to', 'the, a hearing on these violations?', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma’am.', '“THE COURT: And do you wish to give up your right to that', 'hearing today and admit to the violations?', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma’am.', '“THE COURT: Okay.

He further contended that he never would have admitted to the violation if he knew that the new charges that had been brought against him would not be prosecuted.', 'He argued that his', '-4- admission was therefore not knowing and voluntary and that the prosecutor and his attorney “pushed” the deal on him. He also argued that the sentencing magistrate “did not have the authority to sign the entry of final judgment.”', 'The defendant’s motion came before a trial justice of the Superior Court on July 24, 2009; however, the trial justice did not take the matter up, but reassigned the motion to the sentencing magistrate because she “[wa]s the proper party * * * hav[ing] taken the admission to the violation in this particular matter.” On August 12, 2009, the sentencing magistrate conducted a hearing on defendant’s motions. At that hearing, she reviewed the transcript of the March 12, 2009 probation violation hearing, in which defendant indicated that he understood the agreement that the parties had reached and that he had been afforded “plenty of time” to discuss the proposed disposition of the violation with his attorney. The sentencing magistrate then denied defendant’s motions, and an order to that effect was entered on September 6, 2011.', 'The defendant timely appealed to this Court.

A justice of the Superior Court affirmed the retirement board‘s decision on the basis of his conclusion that the Superior Court ―lack[ed] jurisdiction over the instant case‖; he based that conclusion as to the lack of ―jurisdiction‖ on the fact that the petitioner had failed to timely file her appeal with the Superior Court.

In so holding, we decline to adopt petitioner‘s suggestion that the statute means that the time within which one may seek judicial review begins to run on the date of receipt of the notice; the plain language of the statute simply does not permit such an understanding.

The trial justice also addressed in his written decision what he characterized as the ―jurisdictional‖ nature of § 42-35- 15(b).

Our view in this regard is based upon our disinclination to accept the proposition that an appeal pursuant to § 42- 35-15(b) that was filed out of time may never be subject to equitable tolling.

Significantly, however, two explicit statements by the board (one on the record at the conclusion of the final full hearing and one contained within the notice of the final decision that was sent to petitioner and her attorney) provided incorrect information to the effect that the deadline for seeking judicial review was thirty days from the receipt of the notice of the final decision.

71,"State : v. : Dean DeRobbio et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, and Indeglia, JJ. OPINION Justice Indeglia, for the Court. For the first time, we are called upon to interpret the Edward O. Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 28.6 of title 21 (Medical Marijuana Act or Act). The State of Rhode Island (state) appeals from a pretrial order dismissing a five-count criminal information, filed against the defendants, Dean DeRobbio and Joseph Joubert. On appeal, the state contends that the hearing justice committed reversible error in determining that insufficient probable cause existed to believe that the defendants had committed various narcotics-related offenses. The defendants assert that their possession of marijuana was legal under the Act. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers to it with instructions to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I Facts and Travel On June 7, 2010, defendants were charged with (1) possessing marijuana with the intent to deliver it in violation of Rhode Island’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act (CSA), G.L. 1956 -1- § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i) (count 1); (2) manufacturing marijuana in violation of § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i) (count 2); and (3) conspiracy to violate the CSA in violation of § 21-28-4.08 (count 5). In the same information, DeRobbio was also charged with committing a crime of violence—the above- referenced narcotics offenses 1—while having available a firearm in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 47-3 (count 3) and with the unlawful possession of Vicodin in violation of § 21-28-4.01(c)(2)(i) (count 4). 2 The charges stemmed from a warranted search of DeRobbio’s home in Cranston, on January 21, 2010. Before executing that search, Cranston police detectives set up surveillance of DeRobbio’s home. Shortly thereafter, DeRobbio and Joubert exited the home and entered a vehicle, which an officer was directed to stop. During this stop, the officer advised DeRobbio and Joubert that he had a search warrant for DeRobbio’s home. DeRobbio and Joubert then presented the officer with registry identification cards issued to them under the Act, identifying them as a qualifying patient and DeRobbio’s primary caregiver, respectively. 3 Joubert’s registry identification card listed DeRobbio as his only patient. Soon after, detectives executed the search warrant of DeRobbio’s home. 4 That search also revealed a registry identification card 1 Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-2(2), a “crime of violence” includes, among other things, “any felony violation involving the illegal manufacture, sale, or delivery of a controlled substance, or possession with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver a controlled substance * * *.” 2 In its full brief to this Court, the state abandons its appeal of the hearing justice’s dismissal of count 3. In DeRobbio’s brief to this Court, he concedes that the hearing justice erred in dismissing count 4. We agree, and direct that it be reconsidered on remand. 3 Pursuant to the Edward O. Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 28.6 of title 21 (Act), a “[r]egistry identification card” is a document issued by the Rhode Island Department of Health that identifies a person as a registered qualifying patient or a registered primary caregiver. Section 21-28.6-3(11). Pursuant to § 21-28.6-6(d), a qualifying patient may have no more than two individual primary caregivers. The Act will be discussed more fully below. See part I-A, infra. 4 On appeal, defendants do not challenge the validity of this search. -2- issued to Joubert’s mother, Marie Joubert (Mrs. Joubert), which listed her as DeRobbio’s primary caregiver. That same day, police contacted Mrs. Joubert regarding the marijuana found at DeRobbio’s home. According to the police report, she told police that she was a licensed medical marijuana provider, that she was “aware” of the marijuana grown at DeRobbio’s home, and that twenty-four of the marijuana plants located there belonged to her. She further explained that she had been growing that marijuana for her two patients, DeRobbio and another person whose name she could not remember. However, when asked if she could specify which marijuana plants were hers, she stated that they were “mixed in with the other plants,” that she had not seen them grow, and that she had never actually set foot inside DeRobbio’s home. Mrs. Joubert was not charged in connection with this matter. The above-referenced search of DeRobbio’s home revealed in pertinent part: thirty-three marijuana plants; thirty-nine marijuana seedlings without any visible buds; 31.8 grams of marijuana in a plastic container in the freezer; 39.6 grams of marijuana in a plastic freezer bag in the bedroom; 2.4 grams of marijuana in a sandwich bag; 12.1 grams of “burnt” marijuana in a prescription bottle; thirty-three Vicodin tablets in another prescription bottle; and seven Vicodin tablets in a nightstand in the bedroom. 5 According to the police reports, the mature marijuana plants and seedlings were discovered in two separate “grow rooms” located in DeRobbio’s windowless basement. These rooms were equipped with fans, timers, high-wattage lights, humidifiers, a ventilation system, filters, and a calendar with a schedule indicating when to care for the plants. 5 A total of 85.9 grams of marijuana was found at DeRobbio’s home. Since the Act quantifies usable marijuana in terms of ounces, we note that this amount equates to approximately 3.03 ounces of usable marijuana. See § 21-28.6-4(a), (d). -3- On January 5, 2011, DeRobbio moved to dismiss the criminal information as to all counts; Joubert later joined in that motion. In his supporting memorandum, DeRobbio relied on an affirmative defense and dismissal provision set forth in the Act. Before reciting defendants’ arguments in their joint motion to dismiss, as well as their arguments before this Court in support of the hearing justice’s decision to grant that motion, we first provide a brief overview of the Medical Marijuana Act as it relates to this appeal. A The Medical Marijuana Act Enacted by the General Assembly in 2006, 6 the Act contains legislative findings declaring that “[s]tate law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical use of marijuana.” Section 21-28.6-2(5). As such, “the purpose of [the Act] is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, and their physicians and primary caregivers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture if such patients engage in the medical use of marijuana.” Id. To that end, the Act allows certain Rhode Island residents the right to possess “an amount of marijuana that does not exceed twelve (12) mature marijuana plants and two and one-half (2.5) ounces of usable marijuana” for the medical use thereof. Section 21-28.6-4. In order to qualify, those residents (defined as “qualifying patient[s]”) must have been (1) diagnosed by certain medical practitioners as having a debilitating medical condition and (2) issued a registry identification card by the Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH). Sections 21-28.6-3(10); 21-28.6-4(b). The Act also grants qualifying patients the right to possess “a reasonable amount 6 P.L. 2005, ch. 442 § 1 (enacted Jan. 3, 2006). -4- of unusable marijuana, including up to twelve (12) seedlings, which shall not be counted toward the limits in this section.” Section 21-28.6-4(e). The Act defines a “[m]ature marijuana plant” as one “which has flowers or buds that are readily observable by an unaided visual examination.” Section 21-28.6-3(6). “‘Usable marijuana’ means the dried leaves and flowers of the marijuana plant, and any mixture or preparation thereof * * *.” Section 21-28.6-3(14). Distinguished from usable marijuana, “[u]nusable marijuana” consists of “marijuana seeds, stalks, seedlings, and unusable roots.” Section 21-28.6-3(13). Likewise, the Act allows a primary caregiver (defined by § 21-28.6-3(9) as a natural person at least twenty-one years of age who has been issued a registry identification card from the DOH) the right to possess “an amount of marijuana which does not exceed twelve (12) mature marijuana plants and two and one-half (2.5) ounces of usable marijuana for each qualifying patient to whom he or she is connected through the [DOH’s] registration process.” Section 21-28.6-4(d). Further, primary caregivers also have the right to possess “a reasonable amount of unusable marijuana, including up to twelve (12) seedlings, which shall not be counted toward the limits in this section.” Section 21-28.6-4(e). Although a primary caregiver may assist up to five qualifying patients with their medical use of marijuana, at no time may a primary caregiver possess an amount of marijuana in excess of twenty-four marijuana plants and five ounces of usable marijuana for those qualifying patients. Sections 21-28.6-3(9); 21-28.6-4(n). Additionally, the Act permits each qualifying patient to have no more than two primary caregivers. Section 21-28.6-6(d). The Act also contains an affirmative defense and dismissal provision, which, as noted above, served as the basis of defendants’ joint motion to dismiss. Section 21-28.6-8(b) provides -5- that “[a] person may assert the medical purpose for using marijuana in a motion to dismiss, and the charges shall be dismissed following an evidentiary hearing * * *” if the defendant shows the following elements listed in § 21-28.6-8(a): “(1) The qualifying patient’s practitioner has stated that, in the practitioner’s professional opinion, after having completed a full assessment of the person’s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide practitioner-patient relationship, the potential benefits of using marijuana for medical purposes would likely outweigh the health risks for the qualifying patient; and “(2) The person and the person’s primary caregiver, if any, were collectively in possession of a quantity of marijuana that was not more than what is permitted under this chapter to ensure the uninterrupted availability of marijuana for the purpose of alleviating the person’s medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition.” B Motion to Dismiss In a memorandum supporting their joint motion to dismiss, defendants averred that the marijuana found at DeRobbio’s home did not exceed the limits set forth in the Act. Referring to the language cited above, defendants asserted that the phrase “collectively in possession of a quantity of marijuana” clearly allowed DeRobbio, Joubert, and Mrs. Joubert, to collectively possess the entirety of the marijuana at issue. See § 21-28.6-8(a). The defendants also pointed out that, under the terms of the Act, qualifying patients and primary caregivers may “possess a reasonable amount of unusable marijuana, including up to twelve (12) seedlings, which shall not be counted toward the limits in this section.” Section 21- 28.6-4(e). Countering the state’s argument that they possessed a quantity of thirty-nine seedlings—three greater than a collective possession theory would even allow—defendants argued that the photographic evidence provided by the state did not clearly show which plants -6- constituted seedlings. Although the Act limits each qualifying patient’s or caregiver’s possession to twelve seedlings, he or she may possess a “reasonable amount of unusable marijuana,” which is not quantified under the terms of the Act. The defendants argued that some of the unusable marijuana collected at DeRobbio’s home did not constitute seedlings, but rather constituted “dead leaves.” Since the Act does not specifically limit the amount of unusable marijuana (apart from seedlings), defendants contended that their collective possession of unusable marijuana did not violate the Act. Further, defendants argued in the alternative that, at worst, the phrase “collectively in possession” was ambiguous. Citing precedent from this Court, defendants asserted that, in cases where a criminal statute is deemed ambiguous, the rule of lenity must be applied, and accordingly, the criminal information should be dismissed. The state objected to defendants’ motion to dismiss on February 28, 2011. In an accompanying memorandum, the state conceded that defendants were valid medical marijuana cardholders, but argued that they violated the medical marijuana possession limits set forth in the Act. The state contended that the Act did not allow for collective possession of marijuana among qualifying patients and primary caregivers. Thus, the marijuana grown at DeRobbio’s home could not be split up between DeRobbio, Joubert, and Mrs. Joubert. According to the state, the entire amount of marijuana found at DeRobbio’s home was ascribed to DeRobbio. Therefore, the state explained, DeRobbio violated the limits set forth in the Act. Similarly, applying the same reasoning to Joubert’s marijuana possession, the state also argued that Joubert violated the Act by his possession of the entirety of the marijuana, because the marijuana could not be allocated between him, DeRobbio, and Mrs. Joubert. Further, the state maintained that, because Mrs. Joubert could not specifically identify which of the marijuana plants found at -7- DeRobbio’s home actually belonged to her and that she did not actually care for those plants, none of them could be attributed to her as a primary caregiver. A hearing on defendants’ joint motion to dismiss was held before a justice of the Superior Court on May 4, 2011. In a bench decision, the hearing justice dismissed the five-count criminal information. Interpreting the Act to allow for collective possession among DeRobbio, Joubert, and Mrs. Joubert, he determined that defendants lawfully “possess[ed] an authorized amount of marijuana plants and usable marijuana.” “[S]plit it up any way you want,” the hearing justice explained—the amount of marijuana found at DeRobbio’s home could be properly allocated to each of the three cardholders so that each was in lawful possession of marijuana in accordance with the limits set forth in the Act. He further determined that the Act “is a poorly-drafted statute * * * [and] a defendant [should not] be criminally liable for inartful draftsmanship.” As such, he found that “no criminal liability” attached to defendants “for cultivating a lawful amount of marijuana.” An order to that effect was entered on May 16, 2011. C Appeal The state then timely appealed to this Court. 7 On appeal, the state abandons its prior contention that the Act does not provide for collective possession among qualifying patients and their respective primary caregivers. Instead, the state proffers that, even if the Act allowed defendants to grow the marijuana collectively, they nonetheless possessed an amount of marijuana in excess of the Act’s limits. In support of this argument, the state contends that none of the marijuana found at DeRobbio’s home could properly be credited to Mrs. Joubert. 7 Although the state appealed prior to the entry of final judgment, we nonetheless treat its appeal as timely. See Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011). -8- Although a registration card issued to Mrs. Joubert as DeRobbio’s primary caregiver was found at DeRobbio’s home, she had told police that she had never been inside DeRobbio’s home, that she was unable to specify which of the marijuana plants belonged to her, and that she did not personally care for those plants. As a consequence, the state reasons, each defendant, pursuant to § 21-28.6-4(a) and (d), “could lawfully have possessed only twenty-four mature marijuana plants (his [respective] twelve, plus [the other’s] twelve)—nine fewer than the thirty-three mature marijuana plants that were discovered [at DeRobbio’s home] * * *.” The state then applies the same argument to defendants’ possession of the marijuana seedlings, contending that it also exceeded the limits prescribed in the Act. In countering the state’s arguments on appeal, both defendants briefed this Court separately. In support of his contention that the hearing justice correctly dismissed the criminal information, Joubert reasons that, “assuming arguendo that there were multiple possible interpretations of the statute,” the hearing justice correctly interpreted the Act to defendants’ benefit. Similarly, DeRobbio relies on the rule of lenity in countering the state’s argument on appeal. In support of this argument, he maintains that an imposition of criminal liability would be unconstitutional because the Act does not provide fair warning to criminal defendants. He emphasizes that the Act neither unequivocally proscribes a collective grow of marijuana nor specifies the level or degree of participation the qualifying patient and each primary caregiver must demonstrate to comply with the Act. Thus, DeRobbio reasons, the fact that Mrs. Joubert did not personally care for the marijuana plants should not be fatal to defendants’ argument. Further, responding to the state’s contention that he and his two primary caregivers possessed more than the amount of marijuana seedlings allowed under the Act, DeRobbio points out that § 21-28.6-4(e) is silent with respect to whether a primary caregiver may possess more -9- than twelve seedlings, regardless of the number of qualifying patients he or she serves. According to DeRobbio, since Mrs. Joubert served two qualifying patients, as indicated by her registry identification card, it is reasonable to conclude based on the Act’s plain language that she was permitted to possess twenty-four seedlings (twelve for each patient). The additional fifteen seedlings could then be allocated to DeRobbio and Joubert collectively. Thus, DeRobbio contends that he, Joubert, and Mrs. Joubert lawfully possessed the marijuana at issue in this case. II Discussion At the outset, this Court recognizes that there is a constitutional question as to whether the Act is preempted (either in whole or in part) by federal law, which prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana, even if it is used for medical purposes. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 13-15 (2005) (citing 21 U.S.C. §§ 812(c), 841(a)(1), 844(a)). Since neither party has questioned whether the Act can survive under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, either below or on appeal, we decline to do so. See Vigneau v. La Salle, 111 R.I. 179, 181, 300 A.2d 477, 479 (1973) (“[W]e will not pass upon the constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly when the matter has not been brought into question upon the record of the case with clarity and particularity in the trial court so that the trial justice may have the opportunity to pass upon the question.”); see also Devane v. Devane, 581 A.2d 264, 265 (R.I. 1990) (“[I]t is a clear imperative that a trial justice, in the exercise of his or her judicial authority, not resolve a constitutional issue unless and until such issue is actually raised by the parties to the controversy and a necessity for such a decision is clear and imperative. * * * [A] trial justice does not have the authority to sua sponte attack the constitutionality of a statute; it must be raised by a party entitled to make such challenge.”). In light of this Court’s precedent, in which we - 10 - strongly caution against deciding the merits of a constitutional issue not raised by either party, we leave for another day the resolution of whether the Act is preempted by federal law and therefore void, either in whole or in part. See § 21-28.6-10 (discussing severability). We now turn to the merits of the matter actually before us. In making their joint motion to dismiss, defendants relied on the affirmative defense and dismissal provision provided under § 21-28.6-8. 8 In deciding whether to grant the motion to dismiss, the hearing justice was bound by the terms of that provision, which explicitly states that charges brought in a prosecution involving marijuana “shall be dismissed following an evidentiary hearing where the defendant shows the elements listed in [§ 21-28.6-8(a)].” 9 Section 21-28.6-8(b) (emphasis added). We deem the dismissal provision set forth in § 21-28.6-8(b) to be abundantly clear—the burden is on a defendant to request an evidentiary hearing to show that he or she has satisfied the elements listed in subsection (a) of § 21-28.6-8 and was thus in possession of an amount of medical marijuana that conformed to the limits set forth in the Act. Although the Superior Court held a hearing on the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the parties presented no evidence at that hearing, including, among other things, evidence regarding Mrs. Joubert’s role as a primary caregiver. Therefore, since no evidentiary hearing was held, in contravention of the plain terms of the Act, the hearing justice’s dismissal was premature. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the 8 The record is unclear as to whether defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, or under Rule 12 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure (dealing with pretrial motions), which permits a defendant to raise “[a]ny defense or objection which is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue * * * before trial by motion.” The memorandum accompanying their joint motion to dismiss relies exclusively on the affirmative defense set forth under the Act. Later, though, in a colloquy with the hearing justice, defendants stated that they had brought the motion pursuant to both Rule 9.1 and the affirmative defense and dismissal provision under the Act. It is not surprising to this Court that the basis for this motion to dismiss was unclear. We agree with the trial justice that the Act (which we have not previously reviewed) itself is poorly drafted. 9 On appeal, the state does not contest whether defendants have satisfied the requirement set forth in § 21-28.6-8(a)(1). - 11 - Superior Court, and instruct the hearing justice to conduct an evidentiary hearing pursuant to § 21-28.6-8(b). III Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers to it with instructions to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion. - 12 - RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: State v.

For the first time, we are called upon to interpret the Edward O. Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 28.6 of title 21 (Medical Marijuana Act or Act). The State of Rhode Island (state) appeals from a pretrial order dismissing a five-count criminal information, filed against the defendants, Dean DeRobbio and Joseph Joubert. On appeal, the state contends that the hearing justice committed reversible error in determining that insufficient probable cause existed to believe that the defendants had committed various narcotics-related offenses. The defendants assert that their possession of marijuana was legal under the Act. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers to it with instructions to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 7, 2010, defendants were charged with (1) possessing marijuana with the intent to deliver it in violation of Rhode Island’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act (CSA), G.L. 1956', '-1- § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i) (count 1); (2) manufacturing marijuana in violation of § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i) (count 2); and (3) conspiracy to violate the CSA in violation of § 21-28-4.08 (count 5). In the same information, DeRobbio was also charged with committing a crime of violence—the above- referenced narcotics offenses 1—while having available a firearm in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 47-3 (count 3) and with the unlawful possession of Vicodin in violation of § 21-28-4.01(c)(2)(i) (count 4). 2', 'The charges stemmed from a warranted search of DeRobbio’s home in Cranston, on January 21, 2010. Before executing that search, Cranston police detectives set up surveillance of DeRobbio’s home. Shortly thereafter, DeRobbio and Joubert exited the home and entered a vehicle, which an officer was directed to stop. During this stop, the officer advised DeRobbio and Joubert that he had a search warrant for DeRobbio’s home. DeRobbio and Joubert then presented the officer with registry identification cards issued to them under the Act, identifying them as a qualifying patient and DeRobbio’s primary caregiver, respectively. 3 Joubert’s registry identification card listed DeRobbio as his only patient. Soon after, detectives executed the search warrant of DeRobbio’s home. 4 That search also revealed a registry identification card 1', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-2(2), a “crime of violence” includes, among other things, “any felony violation involving the illegal manufacture, sale, or delivery of a controlled substance, or possession with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver a controlled substance * * *.” 2', 'In its full brief to this Court, the state abandons its appeal of the hearing justice’s dismissal of count 3. In DeRobbio’s brief to this Court, he concedes that the hearing justice erred in dismissing count 4. We agree, and direct that it be reconsidered on remand. 3', 'Pursuant to the Edward O. Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 28.6 of title 21 (Act), a “[r]egistry identification card” is a document issued by the Rhode Island Department of Health that identifies a person as a registered qualifying patient or a registered primary caregiver. Section 21-28.6-3(11). Pursuant to § 21-28.6-6(d), a qualifying patient may have no more than two individual primary caregivers. The Act will be discussed more fully below.

According to the police report, she told police that she was a licensed medical marijuana provider, that she was “aware” of the marijuana grown at DeRobbio’s home, and that twenty-four of the marijuana plants located there belonged to her. She further explained that she had been growing that marijuana for her two patients, DeRobbio and another person whose name she could not remember.', 'However, when asked if she could specify which marijuana plants were hers, she stated that they were “mixed in with the other plants,” that she had not seen them grow, and that she had never actually set foot inside DeRobbio’s home. Mrs. Joubert was not charged in connection with this matter.', 'The above-referenced search of DeRobbio’s home revealed in pertinent part: thirty-three marijuana plants; thirty-nine marijuana seedlings without any visible buds; 31.8 grams of marijuana in a plastic container in the freezer; 39.6 grams of marijuana in a plastic freezer bag in the bedroom; 2.4 grams of marijuana in a sandwich bag; 12.1 grams of “burnt” marijuana in a prescription bottle; thirty-three Vicodin tablets in another prescription bottle; and seven Vicodin tablets in a nightstand in the bedroom. 5 According to the police reports, the mature marijuana plants and seedlings were discovered in two separate “grow rooms” located in DeRobbio’s windowless basement.', 'These rooms were equipped with fans, timers, high-wattage lights, humidifiers, a ventilation system, filters, and a calendar with a schedule indicating when to care for the plants. 5', 'A total of 85.9 grams of marijuana was found at DeRobbio’s home. Since the Act quantifies usable marijuana in terms of ounces, we note that this amount equates to approximately 3.03 ounces of usable marijuana. See § 21-28.6-4(a), (d).', '-3-', 'On January 5, 2011, DeRobbio moved to dismiss the criminal information as to all counts; Joubert later joined in that motion. In his supporting memorandum, DeRobbio relied on an affirmative defense and dismissal provision set forth in the Act.', 'Before reciting defendants’ arguments in their joint motion to dismiss, as well as their arguments before this Court in support of the hearing justice’s decision to grant that motion, we first provide a brief overview of the Medical Marijuana Act as it relates to this appeal.', 'A', 'The Medical Marijuana Act', 'Enacted by the General Assembly in 2006, 6 the Act contains legislative findings declaring that “[s]tate law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical use of marijuana.” Section 21-28.6-2(5). As such, “the purpose of [the Act] is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, and their physicians and primary caregivers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture if such patients engage in the medical use of marijuana.” Id.', 'To that end, the Act allows certain Rhode Island residents the right to possess “an amount of marijuana that does not exceed twelve (12) mature marijuana plants and two and one-half (2.5) ounces of usable marijuana” for the medical use thereof. Section 21-28.6-4. In order to qualify, those residents (defined as “qualifying patient[s]”) must have been (1) diagnosed by certain medical practitioners as having a debilitating medical condition and (2) issued a registry identification card by the Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH).

72,State : v. : Hiawatha Brown. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Hiawatha Brown (Brown or defendant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for simple assault and disorderly conduct.', 'Brown contends that the trial justice committed reversible error in refusing to (1) hold a posttrial evidentiary hearing to determine if the jury was racially biased or if certain juror misconduct had occurred; (2) permit the entire fifteen-member jury panel to deliberate; and (3) instruct the jury that the aggressive actions of the police could constitute a defense to the charge of disorderly conduct. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 14, 2003, a confrontation between the Rhode Island State Police and several members of the Narragansett Indian Tribe (the Tribe) led to the arrest of seven tribal members, including Brown. 1 That day, Brown was charged with one count of simple assault in violation of 1', 'A full description of the events underlying the charges is set forth in State v. Thomas, 936 A.2d 1278, 1280 (R.I. 2007). The confrontation spurred both the Tribe and the State of Rhode Island to file lawsuits in federal court to determine whether state officers acted with proper authority in enforcing state laws on the Tribe’s property. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ultimately resolved this litigation in the state’s favor. Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State of Rhode Island, 449 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir. 2006).', '-1- G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 (count 1), one count of disorderly conduct in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45- 1 (count 2), and one count of resisting arrest in violation of G.L. 1956 § 12-7-10 (count 3). The charges against Brown were based on behavior that allegedly included slamming a state trooper’s arm in a door; pushing, choking, and being physically combative with other state troopers; and flailing his arms and legs as troopers attempted to place handcuffs on him.', 'Brown and his six codefendants were jointly tried in Superior Court over the course of several weeks in February and March of 2008. 2 In the remaining portion of Part I, we discuss only those facts relevant to the issues raised on appeal.', 'A', 'Jury Selection and Jury Instructions', 'Jury voir dire and selection began on February 25, 2008, and concluded two days later. Sixteen people were ultimately empaneled on the jury—the maximum number allowed under Rule 24(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Out of the panel of sixteen, three jurors were minorities. One of the three became ill during the course of the trial and was discharged from jury service, leaving only two minorities on the fifteen-member panel.', 'Several weeks later, at the conclusion of the testimony, the trial justice delivered her instructions to the jury. She denied Brown’s request for an instruction that “excessive force [on the state’s part] would constitute an offense [sic]” to the charge of disorderly conduct. 3', 'After the trial justice delivered her instructions, twelve of the fifteen jurors who heard the case were selected to deliberate. Before this process took place, Brown requested that all fifteen 2', 'Brown and five of his codefendants were represented by two attorneys. Another codefendant was represented by a third attorney. For simplicity’s sake, if Brown’s counsel took an action on behalf of Brown and his codefendants, we shall describe that action as Brown’s. 3', 'We assume that Brown’s counsel actually requested an instruction that excessive force would constitute a defense to the charge of disorderly conduct.', '-2- members of the jury be allowed to deliberate or, in the alternative, that the two individuals who were minorities be selected for the twelve-member panel. The state objected to both of these requests. Citing Rule 24(c), the trial justice ruled that she lacked the authority to either seat fifteen jurors without the state’s acquiescence or to select those two individuals as members of the panel. Accordingly, she denied Brown’s requests. Brown has indicated to this Court that “just one person of color” remained after the twelve-member panel was selected.', 'B', 'Jury Deliberations', 'The jury began its deliberations on April 1, 2008. On April 2, 2008, the second day of deliberations, the trial justice received three notes from the jury. The first note stated as follows:', '“I’m concerned about the progress of deliberations. We', 'have one juror who has proclaimed she will not find any', '[d]efendant guilty, regardless of the evidence, because of the', 'conduct [of] the [s]tate [p]olice. We heard this early on and have', 'tried to convince her with regard to the laws we need to address,', 'but she is unmovable. We have at least five charges we cannot', 'agree upon. Any advice?” Hours after the trial justice received this first note (to which neither she nor the parties responded), she received a second note in which the jury requested clarification on the issue of self-defense. The note also stated that the jury was “deadlocked on about [eleven] of the [sixteen] charges. Many tears. Much frustration.”', 'After she received the second note, the trial justice called the jury back into the courtroom and gave them additional instructions concerning self-defense. Deliberations then resumed. Shortly thereafter, the jury sent the trial justice a third note. This note stated that the', '-3- jury was “hung on all charges. Complete impasse. No compromise.” After giving the jury an Allen charge, the trial justice dismissed the jury for the day. 4', 'The following day, on April 3, 2008, the trial justice met with counsel in chambers to read into the record the three notes she had received from the jury. She also explained that, on the previous day, one of the deputy sheriffs assigned to the jury had reported to her an incident that occurred as the jurors were leaving the jury room at the end of the day. That sheriff was brought into chambers, where he recounted the incident for the record. He “noticed three or four of the jurors lagg[ing] behind * * *. I observed them speaking. And the one I mainly observed was Juror 175. * * * [H]e was speaking about the case.” The sheriff felt that Juror 175 was “lobbying his opinion.” He told Juror 175 that jurors were not allowed to discuss the case outside of deliberations, when all twelve members were present.', 'He said that Juror 175 “immediately threw up his hand and said, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry.’” In response to the trial justice’s inquiries, the sheriff explained that he concluded the jurors had been talking about the case based on “[t]heir mannerisms” and the fact that Juror 175 “was speaking [in a] low [manner].”', 'Based on the sheriff’s observations, the trial justice interviewed several of the jurors, speaking with each individually in chambers in the presence of counsel. 5 Juror 245 denied that he and the other jurors whom the sheriff had observed were talking about the case; he said that they “were talking about motivations, about * * * where other people are coming from.” Next, the trial justice interviewed Juror 141. She reported that, although she had been “frustrated” and 4', '“An Allen charge is ‘[a] supplemental jury instruction given by the court to encourage a deadlocked jury, after prolonged deliberations, to reach a verdict.’” State v. Gordon, 30 A.3d 636, 640 n.9 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 351 n.8 (R.I. 2011)). 5', 'Although the jurors interviewed were identified by name on the record, we use only their juror numbers to protect their privacy.', '-4- “upset” by the process of deliberation, she had not talked with other jurors about the case or about any jurors in particular. The trial justice then spoke with Juror 175. He described the encounter the deputy sheriff had observed as “a couple of [jurors] * * * just expressing frustration.” He also denied that they had been discussing the evidence or the substance of the case.', 'The trial justice then spoke separately with Jurors 171 and 112. Juror 171 said that some of the jurors were “very, very emotional, so [he kept] reassuring them that they have to go with their conscience, and have to do what they feel is right * * *.” He also said that they had not been discussing the case itself. This juror also offered the somewhat cryptic comment that there were “conflicts of personalities [on the jury], but it’s more of a visual thing rather than a spoken thing.” Juror 112 had a hazy memory of the previous afternoon and said she did not remember discussing the case with anyone.', 'After defense counsel raised concerns about the remarks of Jurors 245 and 175, the trial justice then separately interviewed these two jurors a second time. Juror 175 stated that “when we sit down to deliberate and try to discuss and review the evidence, * * * right off the bat we have one or two people that [sic] come right out and said--.” The trial justice cut him off mid- sentence to prevent him from disclosing specifics. Juror 175 also said that, during the encounter the deputy sheriff had observed on the previous day, none of the jurors had spoken of any other juror in particular when expressing frustration.', 'Juror 245 explained that, when the deputy sheriff observed the small group of jurors talking among themselves, they had been “discussing why people might not be open to thinking, * * *, why people might be so adamant about the positions that they have.” Although none of', '-5- them referred to a specific juror or jurors, he said that “we probably said ‘they’ and probably knew who the other two jurors were.”', 'Once the juror interviews had concluded, Brown moved for a mistrial, arguing that the deliberative process “ha[d] broken down.” Brown also moved, in the alternative, for the removal of Juror 175. The state objected, pointing out that the jurors’ private remarks indicated that they had simply been consoling one another after a difficult day of deliberations and that none of them had discussed the case itself outside of deliberations.', 'The trial justice concluded that the jurors’ remarks provided no basis for a mistrial. Although she described Juror 175 as “brusk [sic],” she felt that “[h]e didn’t say anything that would cause me to think that he had tainted the jury or [that] he was tainted.” As for Juror 245, while the trial justice said she had some concerns about his remarks, she believed that he and the jurors with whom he had spoken had not been discussing the case. The trial justice pointed out that the sheriff had merely observed the jurors speaking with each other and had not heard what any of them said. She concluded by stating: “They seem[ed] to be venting some frustration and emotion on the way out the door. Is that enough to grant a mistrial? I don’t think it is.” The trial justice also denied Brown’s motion to excuse Juror 175 for cause.', 'Thereafter, the trial justice called the entire jury into the courtroom and gave them what she called a “pep talk.” She reiterated the elements of the charged offenses and the defenses that had been raised and encouraged the jury to reach a verdict. Deliberations resumed thereafter. 6 6', 'The following day, on April 4, 2008, the trial justice and counsel had a sidebar discussion concerning the implications of comments made to the press by one of the defense attorneys; those comments included details about the notes from the jury and the progress of the deliberations. Although this incident has no direct relevance to this appeal, we take this opportunity to remind all lawyers who practice in Rhode Island that such conduct is strictly prohibited. See Article V, Rule 3.6 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct (“Trial publicity”).', '-6-', 'C', 'Verdict and Motion for a New Trial', 'On April 4, 2008, a jury convicted Brown of simple assault (count 1) and disorderly conduct (count 2). Brown was acquitted of resisting arrest (count 3). 7 On count 1, the trial justice sentenced Brown to a suspended jail term of one year with one year probation; she also ordered him to attend anger management counseling. On count 2, the trial justice sentenced Brown to a suspended jail term of six months with six months probation. Both sentences were concurrent with each other.', 'Of Brown’s six codefendants, four were acquitted on all charges. Of the two remaining codefendants, one (Matthew Thomas) was convicted of simple assault and acquitted of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest; and one (Randy Noka) was convicted of disorderly conduct and acquitted of resisting arrest.', 'On May 7, 2008, about one month after the verdict was announced, Brown moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Brown’s motion stated that, following the trial, he had “uncovered evidence of juror misconduct that infected the jury deliberation process and violated [his] constitutional rights to a fair trial.” 8 The motion was accompanied by affidavits from three jurors who had contacted Brown’s counsel after the trial concluded.', 'Those affidavits described conduct that, according to Brown, “compel[led] a hearing as to whether any juror * * * harbored a prohibited animus towards 7', 'The state’s brief inaccurately states that Brown was acquitted of disorderly conduct. Counsel for the state acknowledged at oral argument that Brown was indeed convicted on this charge, as is apparent from our review of the record. 8', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a defendant to move for a new trial “based on newly discovered evidence * * * within three (3) years after the entry of judgment * * *.” Earlier, Brown had also moved for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence against him. Because he has not appealed that aspect of the trial justice’s decision, we do not discuss it here.', '-7- [Brown and his codefendants].” Because the affidavits are central to Brown’s argument on appeal, we review them in detail.', 'The first affidavit was from a juror to whom we refer as Juror A. She identified herself as “the lone minority juror” and stated that she was “deeply concerned about the bias and conduct” of two other jurors. In her view, those two jurors—to whom we refer as Juror 1 and Juror 2—“appeared to have a joint agenda.” Juror A averred that the foreperson had sent a note to the trial justice without input or approval from other jurors. Juror A was referring to the note sent by the foreperson on April 2, 2008, which reported concerns about a juror who would not consider convicting any of the defendants. Juror A also detailed two incidents on which Jurors 1 and 2 displayed what she viewed as bias toward Brown and his codefendants. First, observing Brown and his codefendants stand when Matthew Thomas (the Tribe’s Chief Sachem) testified at trial, Juror 1 remarked, “Why did they stand up? He’s nothing.” Additionally, Juror 2 stated during deliberations, “Who are those people to touch a police officer?”', 'The second affidavit was from a juror to whom we refer as Juror B. Juror B stated that she believed Jurors 1 and 2 had discussed the case outside of deliberations. She admitted that she had not heard them discuss the case outside of the presence of other jurors, but stated that her opinion was “base[d] * * * on [her] own personal observations of their conduct.” Juror B also stated that Juror 2 had referred to the defendants as “those people” when, during deliberations, Juror 2 commented that one should never touch a police officer. Juror B also averred that “[w]hen [the jury] finally reached a verdict * * * [Juror 2] banged two water bottles together like', '-8- he was playing a tom-tom drum.” 9 As had Juror A, Juror B stated that she was not consulted before the foreperson sent the first note to the trial justice on April 2, 2008.', 'The third affidavit was from a juror to whom we refer as Juror C. He stated his opinion that Jurors 1 and 2 had displayed a “disrespectful attitude toward the defendants,” but “never used any racial epithets.” He also recalled that Juror 2 had “bang[ed] two water bottles in a ‘tom-tom’ cadence” and stated that he “thought this was very disrespectful.” Although Juror C “never actually heard” Jurors 1 and 2 speaking about the case, he stated that he “[found] it hard to believe that they did not discuss the case out of the presence of the other jurors.” He also stated that the jury “did not discuss the contents of the first note that the foreperson sent” to the trial justice.', 'On June 17, 2008, a hearing was held on Brown’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice identified the pertinent issue as “whether or not any evidentiary hearing is needed * * *.” Brown’s counsel contended that the affidavits contained “comments that could be determined to be racially motivated * * *.”', 'He argued that the affidavits constituted evidence of juror misconduct and bias, and he suggested that the trial justice should hold an evidentiary hearing on this subject.', 'In response, the prosecutor urged the trial justice to deny Brown’s motion for a new trial, characterizing it as “based upon speculation” and “interpretations of other people’s conduct.” She argued that, because the affidavits did not demonstrate that extraneous information invaded the jury’s deliberations, the court could not consider them as evidence under Rule 606(b) of the 9', 'A “tom-tom” is defined as “(1) Any of various small-headed drums, usually long and narrow, that are beaten with the hands. (2) A gong having a metal disk struck with a felt-covered hammer or stick. (3) A monotonous rhythmical drumbeat or similar sound.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1818 (4th ed. 2009).', '-9- Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 10 In her view, neither the alleged references to “those people” nor the tom-tom cadence allegedly played on the water bottles constituted evidence of racial bias. She also pointed out that none of the affidavits suggested that jurors had used racial epithets in describing the defendants.', 'In a thorough and well-reasoned decision from the bench, the trial justice denied Brown’s motion for a new trial. She first commented that “[t]he fundamental goal of a trial justice is to ensure a fair and impartial trial for the defendants.” She explained that the allegations of juror misconduct set forth in Brown’s motion fell into three distinct categories. The first category comprised “alliances between jurors * * *, verbal fights between the jurors, * * * personality differences, demeaning references, [and] insulting behavior.” The second category consisted of “conversations * * * between jurors, outside the presence of other jurors during the deliberations.” The third and final category encompassed “any suggestion of any racial bias or motivation.”', 'The trial justice analyzed the first two categories of allegations in light of Rule 606(b). Relying on precedent from this Court, the trial justice found that the affidavits did not indicate that the jurors considered anything other than the evidence presented at trial. Although the affidavits suggested that some jurors had conversations outside the presence of the full jury, she 10', 'Rule 606(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states as follows:', '“Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may', 'not testify as to any matter or statement [occurring] during the course of', 'the jury’s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or her or any', 'other juror’s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or', 'dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror’s mental', 'processes in connection therewith * * *. Nor may the juror’s affidavit or', 'evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which', 'the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these', 'purposes.”', '- 10 - found that “no one heard anyone say anything specific.” Even assuming the truth of the affidavits, she found that they contained nothing more than “assumptions or speculations.” Accordingly, ruling on the first and second categories of juror misconduct, the trial justice denied Brown’s motion for a new trial or for an evidentiary hearing.', 'The trial justice next considered whether the affidavits supported Brown’s contention that a new trial or an evidentiary hearing should be granted because racial bias infected the jury’s deliberative process. At the outset, she stated that Rule 606(b) would not constrain her decision on this issue. She recognized that “the importance of jury secrecy might, on the rarest of occasions, be outweighed by [the] consideration of fundamental fairness to [a] defendant.”', 'The trial justice also noted that this Court’s precedent provided little guidance on the issue of whether the affidavits constituted a sufficient showing of racial bias to warrant an evidentiary hearing. She reviewed a number of cases from other jurisdictions that had informed her decision. After indicating that she had given “extraordinary consideration” to the statements contained in the affidavits, the trial justice characterized them as “impressions or opinions or conclusions based on conduct that [she considered] to be ambiguous.” She found that none of the jurors had made clear statements evidencing racial bias; rather, the affidavits demonstrated statements or conduct that was “ambiguous,” “innocuous,” and “capable of different interpretations.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied Brown’s motion for a new trial or for an evidentiary hearing with respect to the allegations of juror bias.', 'Final judgment entered on July 29, 2008. Thereafter, defendant timely appealed to this Court. 11 11', 'Although Brown’s notice of appeal was filed prematurely, we treat such a filing as timely. State v. Lamoureux, 58 A.3d 189, 192 n.4 (R.I. 2013).', '- 11 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Brown raises three issues on appeal to this Court. His primary argument is that the trial justice should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to ensure that racial bias had not pervaded the jury’s deliberative process. Brown disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusion that, absent a more substantial showing of racial bias, she did not have the authority to hold such a hearing. Second, he contends that the trial justice erred in denying his request that all fifteen jurors who heard the evidence be seated on the deliberating panel. In this regard, Brown also faults the trial justice for not requiring the prosecution to offer a race-neutral reason for refusing to seat more than twelve jurors. Lastly, he argues that the trial justice erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could find him not guilty of disorderly conduct if it found that the state police had initiated the disturbance.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Allegations of Juror Misconduct', 'We agree with the trial justice that the allegations of juror misconduct contained within the affidavits fall into distinct categories. Although she separated the allegations into three categories, we think it proper to divide them into two: those alleging racial bias and those alleging misconduct of a different nature. We analyze both categories in turn.', '- 12 -', '1', 'Racial Bias', 'The starting point for our analysis of this issue is Rule 606(b), which erects a nearly impregnable fortress around the jury’s deliberative process. 12 That fortress, however, can be breached in some situations.', '“[A] juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.” Rule 606(b).', 'We have identified Rule 606(b)’s “underlying public policies” as “providing for the termination of litigation and * * * ensuring that jury verdicts ‘possess a conclusiveness that will preserve the stability of the jury trial as an instrument for doing substantial justice.’” State v. Drowne, 602 A.2d 540, 543 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Palumbo v. Garrott, 95 R.I. 496, 502, 188 A.2d 371, 374 (1963)). However, we have also recognized that these policies may sometimes conflict with “a criminal defendant’s right to be judged solely upon evidence presented in the courtroom * * *.” State v. Hartley, 656 A.2d 954, 959 (R.I. 1995).', 'There are but a handful of Rhode Island cases citing Rule 606(b), and only some of them are helpful to our determination of whether racial bias can be considered “extraneous prejudicial information” or an “outside influence”—an issue of first impression in this Court. In Drowne, the trial court conducted a hearing to interview a juror who had given an equivocal response during a poll of the jury. Drowne, 602 A.2d at 541-542. Citing Rule 606(b), we held that the juror’s testimony could not be used to impeach the defendant’s verdict because it “reveal[ed] an explanation of [her] deliberative process and the factors she considered in reaching a guilty verdict. This explanation is the exact testimony that Rule 606(b) prohibits * * *.” Drowne, 602 12', 'The full text of this rule appears in footnote 11 of this opinion. See part I-C, supra.', '- 13 - A.2d at 543. We noted that the record “reflect[ed] no evidence that any juror received an unauthorized prejudicial communication or that any outside influence was improperly exerted on a juror.” Id.', 'Three years after deciding Drowne, this Court considered for the first time whether affidavits alleging juror misconduct could be used to impeach the verdict in a criminal case. Hartley, 656 A.2d at 957-62. In that case, the juror affidavits alleged multiple acts of misconduct committed by several different jurors. 13 Id. at 957. We remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing on the defendant’s motion for a new trial, holding that jurors could testify at that hearing about the alleged acts of misconduct, but could not testify “regarding the deliberative process, including the effect that any extraneous information had on his or her decision to return a guilty verdict.” Id. at 959, 962.', 'Two cases decided after Hartley centered on allegations of juror misconduct that fell within the embrace of Rule 606(b). One case involved an allegation that a juror had visited the scene of the crime during the course of the trial and had told the other jurors that she had “observe[d] the layout of the store and the location of the surveillance cameras.” State v. Rodriquez, 694 A.2d 1202, 1203 (R.I. 1997). Another case involved a juror who had allegedly “brought toy cars into the deliberations as a visual aid” and “read aloud calculations, possibly based on his son’s driver’s training handbook, estimating braking distances of automobiles at certain speeds.” Amphavannasouk v. Simoneau, 861 A.2d 451, 452 (R.I. 2004). 13', 'One juror had conducted what the Court termed an “unauthorized view/experiment;” he also investigated the defendant’s primary alibi witness. State v. Hartley, 656 A.2d 954, 957 (R.I. 1995). Another juror had offered comments during deliberations based upon his girlfriend’s experience as the victim of a robbery. Id. Yet another juror had asked a police officer about the effects of mace and shared his findings with the rest of the jury. Id.', '- 14 -', 'This review of our precedent shows that we have never before been asked to identify racial bias as the sort of “extraneous prejudicial information” or “outside influence” contemplated by Rule 606(b). We therefore look to federal caselaw to aid our determination of this issue. Cf. Hartley, 656 A.2d at 959 (“Rule 606(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence was modeled after, and is identical to, Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence except for minor syntactical changes.”).', 'In deciding this issue, two federal appellate courts have concluded that Rule 606(b) precludes the admission of juror testimony regarding alleged racial bias to impeach a verdict. See United States v. Villar, 586 F.3d 76, 84 (1st Cir. 2009); United States v. Benally, 546 F.3d 1230, 1236 (10th Cir. 2008). The Villar and Benally courts disagreed, however, on whether the Sixth Amendment might require the admission of such testimony. The Tenth Circuit explained that certain “‘aspects of the trial process’ * * * serve to protect [a] defendant’s Sixth Amendment right [to a fair trial] without breaching the ban on post-verdict juror testimony.” Benally, 546 F.3d at 1240 (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 127 (1987)). It identified those protections as “voir dire, observation of the jury during court, reports by jurors of inappropriate behavior before they render a verdict, and post-verdict impeachment by evidence other than juror testimony.” Id. (citing Tanner, 483 U.S. at 127). The Benally court also described “jury perfection” as “an untenable goal.” Id.', 'In contrast, the First Circuit held that those aspects of the trial process “do not provide adequate safeguards in the context of racially and ethnically biased comments made during deliberations.” Villar, 586 F.3d at 87. While “emphasiz[ing] that not every stray or isolated off- base statement made during deliberations requires a hearing at which jury testimony is taken[,]” it held that “certain rare and exceptional cases involving racial or ethnic prejudice * * * require', '- 15 - hearing jury testimony to determine whether a defendant received a fair trial under the Sixth Amendment.” Id. at 87, 88.', 'Consistent with the First and Tenth Circuits, we hold that a juror’s racial bias is not “extraneous prejudicial information” or an “outside influence” within the embrace of Rule 606(b).', 'However, we agree with the Villar court that Rule 606(b) does not preclude the admission of such testimony where necessary to protect a defendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury—a right guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions.', 'See U.S. Const. Amend. VI; R.I. Const. art. I, sec. 10. “The determination of whether an inquiry is necessary to vindicate a criminally accused’s constitutional due process and Sixth Amendment rights is best made by the trial judge, who is most familiar with the strength of the evidence and best able to determine the probability of prejudice * * *.” Villar, 586 F.3d at 88. This narrow and focused inquiry must not violate Rule 606(b)’s prohibition against the admission of evidence regarding the jury’s deliberative process. See Hartley, 656 A.2d at 959. We now proceed to consider whether the trial justice correctly decided that such a hearing was unnecessary in this case.', 'Two aspects of this prosecution are central to our conclusion that the trial justice correctly decided that Brown’s allegations of juror bias did not warrant an evidentiary hearing. The first is that the jury returned a mix of convictions and acquittals against Brown and his six codefendants, all of whom were members of the Tribe. Each of the defendants was acquitted on at least one charge, and a majority of the defendants were acquitted on all charges. The second is that the jury returned a mix of convictions and acquittals against Brown himself. Taken together, these facts belie his argument that the jury was biased against him. They demonstrate that, as they were instructed to do, the jury carefully considered the evidence on each charge against', '- 16 - each defendant. The essence of Brown’s primary argument on appeal is that he was convicted because of his race, but the verdict itself discounts this contention.', 'The allegations of racial bias in the affidavits amounted to the following conduct: (1) Juror 1’s statement that the Tribe’s Chief Sachem was “nothing”; (2) Juror 2’s use of the term “those people” in describing Brown and his codefendants; and (3) Juror 2’s act of banging water bottles like tom-tom drums. As did the trial justice, we conclude that none of these three statements or acts is overtly racist. Juror 1’s comment that the Chief Sachem was “nothing” may have been impolite; but, as the trial justice noted, it was made after defendants stood up when he took the stand—an act that was certainly out of the ordinary. 14 Juror 2’s use of the term “those people” can be understood as an acceptance of the state’s argument that defendants had no legal entitlement to lay hands on the officers during the smokeshop confrontation. We agree with the trial justice’s finding that this comment did not necessarily have a racist undertone. Finally, we admit some confusion (as did the trial justice) over the allegation regarding Juror 2’s act of banging water bottles like tom-tom drums. We think the trial justice was correct in describing this behavior as “ambiguous,” “innocuous,” and “capable of different interpretations.”', 'Moreover, the trial justice correctly characterized the allegations of racial bias contained within the affidavits as speculative. According to the affiants, none of the jurors uttered racial slurs, and none explicitly or implicitly suggested that Brown’s racial or ethnic background should factor into the jury’s decision-making process. These facts distinguish this case from others to which the parties have cited both before the Superior Court and before this Court. See, e.g., Villar, 586 F.3d at 81 (where defendant was of Hispanic descent, one juror reported that 14', 'The trial justice reminded the parties that she had asked counsel if they wanted her to issue an instruction to the jury regarding this behavior. They declined this offer. In doing so, said the trial justice, “they took the risk that the jury [would] not agree with that [behavior], and that’s normal.”', '- 17 - another had stated, “I guess we’re profiling but they cause all the trouble”); Benally, 546 F.3d at 1231 (foreman allegedly stated that “[w]hen Indians get alcohol, they all get drunk”); Commonwealth v. Laguer, 571 N.E.2d 371, 375 (Mass. 1991) (affidavit reported that a juror had made several statements in which he referred to the defendant using a racial slur).', 'We perceive no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that it was unnecessary to hold an evidentiary hearing to preserve Brown’s constitutional rights. Next, we consider whether the trial justice erred in likewise concluding that other alleged juror misconduct warranted neither a new trial nor an evidentiary hearing.', '2', 'Other Alleged Misconduct', 'The non-race-related juror misconduct alleged in the affidavits consisted of (1) the foreperson’s sending a note to the trial justice without the knowledge or approval of the entire jury panel; and (2) Jurors 1 and 2 discussing the case outside of deliberations. We hold that the trial justice properly denied Brown’s motion for a new trial or an evidentiary hearing based on that alleged misconduct. She recognized that her discretion on this issue was circumscribed by Rule 606(b), and she found that the affidavits did not indicate that the jury had considered extrinsic evidence.', 'She stated that the affiants had alleged only “speculation[s]” and “assumption[s] based on behavior.” Regarding the note, the trial justice indicated that she had ignored it and that Brown had made no motion in response. She refused to “invade the jury deliberation process * * * by considering or accepting any testimony either by evidentiary hearing or affidavits regarding this jury process.” Because this conclusion is consistent with precedent from this Court and the United States Supreme Court, we affirm her decision on this issue. See Moynihan v. Yetra, 648 A.2d 1361, 1363 (R.I. 1994) (“[J]urors’ affidavits when', '- 18 - offered to prove what any of the jurors may have done either before or during their deliberations cannot be used to impeach their verdict.”) (quoting Roberts v. Kettelle, 116 R.I. 283, 299, 356 A.2d 207, 217 (1976)); see also Tanner, 483 U.S. at 127 (“[L]ong-recognized and very substantial concerns support the protection of jury deliberations from intrusive inquiry.”).', 'B', 'Selection of Deliberating Panel', 'We next consider whether the trial justice erred in denying Brown’s request that all fifteen jurors who heard the evidence be seated on the deliberating panel. Brown also ascribes error to her failure to require the prosecution to offer a race-neutral reason for refusing to seat more than twelve jurors. Our conclusion on this issue is guided by Rule 24(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“If more than [twelve jurors] remain at the conclusion of the', 'court’s charge, the clerk in the presence of the court and the parties', 'shall put the names of the remaining jurors in a box and from it', 'shall draw twelve (12) names, or such other number stipulated to', 'by the parties, to determine the issues.” (Emphasis added.)', 'The rule is clear: no more than twelve jurors may be seated unless both parties agree. Because jury verdicts must be unanimous under Rule 31(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, and because the state bears the burden of proof in criminal cases, it is unsurprising that the prosecution refused to stipulate to the seating of more than twelve jurors on the deliberating panel. See State v. Stallman, 78 R.I. 90, 93, 79 A.2d 611, 612 (1951) (“[T]he state always has the burden of establishing [a defendant’s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt * * *.”). Furthermore, this Court has held that a criminal defendant does not possess “the right to be tried by any particular juror.” State v. McDowell, 685 A.2d 252, 255 (R.I. 1996). Accordingly,', '- 19 - we discern no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that she had no authority, absent the prosecution’s agreement, to seat more than twelve jurors on the deliberating panel.', 'We must also reject Brown’s argument that Rule 24(c) unconstitutionally operates to exclude minorities from the deliberating panel. This rule is color-blind. It does not discriminate between minorities and nonminorities; rather, it simply operates to whittle the deliberating panel down to twelve people if alternate jurors have been empaneled. Because improper race-based decisions may be made during the initial jury selection process, the United States Supreme Court has established a procedure aimed at preserving a litigant’s constitutional right to equal protection. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 96-98 (1986); see also State v. Pona, 926 A.2d 592, 601-05 (R.I. 2007) (discussing Batson and its progeny).', 'By contrast, the completely random process of selecting twelve names from a box requires no safeguards against discrimination. In our view, the trial justice did not err in declining to require the prosecution to proffer race-neutral reasons for refusing to stipulate to a deliberating panel of greater than twelve jurors.', 'C', 'Jury Instructions', 'Finally, we consider whether the trial justice erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could find Brown not guilty of disorderly conduct if it found that the state police had initiated the disturbance. We review de novo a defendant’s request for specific jury instructions. State v. Ricci, 54 A.3d 965, 971 (R.I. 2012). “Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-38, ‘we determine whether the jury charge sufficiently addresses the requested instructions and correctly states the applicable law.’” State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1166 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 855 (R.I. 2008)). If a trial justice declines to issue a specific instruction that is “fairly', '- 20 - covered in the general charge,” we will leave this ruling undisturbed. Ricci, 54 A.3d at 971 (quoting State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 934 (R.I. 1998)).', 'Our review of Rhode Island law reveals no cases that support Brown’s argument. Indeed, Brown has mustered only one case in support of his argument on this issue: a 1957 decision from a County Court of New York. See People v. Jerome, 168 N.Y.S.2d 452 (County Ct. 1957). In that case, the court reversed the defendant’s conviction for disorderly conduct because the charge was based upon his conduct in defending himself against an unlawful arrest. Id. at 457. Here, by contrast, Brown was lawfully arrested. Because our precedent does not suggest that provocation on the state’s part could constitute a defense to disorderly conduct, the trial justice’s failure to issue an instruction to that effect is not reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm her ruling with respect to the requested instruction.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 21 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

Pursuant to § 40.1-5.3-9, the director of the department petitioned the Superior Court for an emergency transfer of Briggs, a sentenced inmate, from the Forensic Unit of the Eleanor Slater Hospital—where he was receiving specialized mental-health services as a psychiatric inpatient—back to the ACI where he previously had been incarcerated. On behalf of Briggs, the Mental Health Advocate 2 objected to the transfer. Before this Court, Briggs contends that his emergency transfer to the ACI, in the absence of a full evidentiary hearing, violated his procedural due-process rights. He further argues that, based on allegations that the department 1', 'After the Superior Court proceedings in this matter, the Rhode Island General Assembly changed the name of the Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals to the “Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.” We will simply use the term “the department” in this opinion. 2', 'The statutes setting forth the duties of the Mental Health Advocate include G.L. 1956 §§ 40.1- 5-13, 40.1-5-22, and 40.1-5-24.

After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Briggs was convicted of three counts of first-degree sexual assault after a jury-waived trial, and on October 6, 2003, he was sentenced to serve sixty years imprisonment. In September 2009, while incarcerated at the ACI, Briggs was evaluated by Dr. Jody Underwood, a psychiatrist employed by the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. In the psychiatrist’s opinion, Briggs was suffering from a serious mental illness and, at that time, was in need of the therapeutic setting of a psychiatric hospital. After a petition was filed with the Superior Court, Briggs was transferred to the Forensic Unit on September 24, 2009, by order of a trial justice, pursuant to § 40.1-5.3-6. 3 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 40.1-5.3-6, entitled “Examination of persons awaiting trial or convicted and imprisoned for crime,” provides:', '“On a petition of the director of the department of mental health,', 'retardation, and hospitals, or on the petition of the director of the', 'department of corrections, setting forth that any person awaiting', 'trial or convicted of a crime and imprisoned for the crime in the', 'adult correctional institutions is mentally ill and requires', 'specialized mental health care and psychiatric in-patient services', 'which cannot be provided in a correctional facility, a justice of the', '-2-', 'However, Briggs did not encounter smooth sailing while he was hospitalized.', 'On November 2, 2009, the department sought emergency relief from the Superior Court for the transfer of Briggs back to the ACI under § 40.1-5.3-9. 4 The allegations that constituted the perceived emergency were set forth in a letter addressed to the Mental Health Advocate and signed by the associate director of the department. This letter, dated November 2, 2009, starkly declared that Briggs’s “continued presence at the Forensic Unit of [Eleanor Slater Hospital] presents a clear health and safety risk to the other patients and staff on the ward.” The letter also said that the department “has assessed Mr. Briggs and [it has] determined that he does not require specialized psychiatric services at the Forensic Unit of the [Eleanor Slater Hospital] and can receive appropriate care at the ACI,” and that “[t]he Department of Corrections has evaluated Mr. Briggs and they are in agreement that he is not in need of specialized psychiatric services at the [Eleanor Slater Hospital] and can be transferred back to the ACI to serve the remainder of his sentence.” Finally, the letter provided that the department would be appearing before a Superior Court justice “to petition the court on an emergency basis to transfer Irving Briggs (10/7/68) back to the ACI” that day.', 'Despite the short notice, the Mental Health Advocate appeared in court on behalf of Briggs. 5 The trial justice held a conference with both attorneys in his chambers that was not recorded, and after the conference, the parties articulated their arguments on the record.

He explained that Briggs’s most recent hostile actions were directed at a nurse and that that serious incident had taken place over the weekend. Also, concern was expressed about threats directed toward a treating psychiatrist that had occurred within the previous week. The department’s counsel explained that Briggs’s behavior was becoming more aggressive and that it was the opinion of the department physicians that Briggs had been feigning psychiatric symptoms because there was a possibility that he would be moved back to the ACI. Based on his increased aggression that seemed to be correlated to his potential transfer, the department’s counsel expressed worry that Briggs would likely increase his dangerous behavior if he were to learn of a pending transfer hearing. 6 The Mental Health Advocate objected to the proceeding. He questioned the credibility of the department’s presentation that this was in fact an emergency situation, and he argued that the department must file a petition and a hearing must be held before Briggs could be moved back to the ACI, pursuant to § 40.1-5.3-9.', 'After hearing from the parties, the trial justice observed that § 40.1-5.3-9 was silent about whether a hearing should be provided in the case of an inmate being returned to the ACI, and that chapter 5.3 of title 40.1 was devoid of any direction as to how to proceed in an emergency. The trial justice deferred to the decision of another Superior Court justice in 2002 that concluded 6', 'The department’s counsel also asserted in chambers—based on information supposedly gleaned from Briggs himself—that Briggs was wanted in Illinois for two murders. However, as of November 5, 2009, the information about the two alleged murders was acknowledged to be inaccurate. The trial justice rebuked the department about this misinformation, stating that he was “a bit troubled that it certainly was represented that Mr. Briggs had committed two murders in the State of Illinois. * * * The fact that there was some misleading with regard to that is troubling, I cannot emphasize that enough.” However, he explained that the incorrect information about the two murders “was not [his] sole motivating factor” for granting the emergency transfer. He indicated that he considered “[Briggs’s] violence while [i]n the forensic unit, [and the] personal safety and welfare of both the staff and the other inmates.”', '-4- that inmates being moved from the Forensic Unit back to the ACI should be entitled to evidentiary hearings similar to those conducted pursuant to §§ 40.1-5.3-6 and 40.1-5.3-7, which mapped out the procedure to be followed when transferring an inmate from the ACI to the Forensic Unit. 7 Against this background, and after noting that the procedure for an emergency transfer from the Forensic Unit back to the ACI was an issue of first impression, the trial justice weighed the potential harm to Briggs if he were immediately transferred against the potential harm that could occur to others if he were to remain at the Forensic Unit. The trial justice concluded that “[i]f the court is not allowed to transfer, there may be some chaos or, at worse, some serious injury that results.”', 'To support his decision to allow the transfer in advance of a full evidentiary hearing, the trial justice cited Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 545 (1985), which provides that “[i]n general, ‘something less’ than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient” in the pre-deprivation context. 8 The trial justice noted that Briggs had been afforded some due process before his transfer: counsel for Briggs had been provided with notice of the emergency hearing, counsel had been able to participate in a chambers conference, and counsel had been given the opportunity to place her concerns on the record. Based on this reasoning, the trial justice ordered 7', 'In the trial justice’s decision, dated February 19, 2010, he discussed administrative order 86-1, which addresses emergency transfers to the Forensic Unit pursuant to § 40.1-5.3-6, and suggested that it should also apply to transfers under § 40.1-5.3-9. 8', 'In Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985), the United States Supreme Court considered the due-process rights to be afforded to a public employee before the employee is terminated. Id. The Court stated that “[t]he tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer’s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.” Id. The Court further opined that while a pre- termination “hearing” is necessary, it “need not be elaborate,” and that “[i]n general, ‘something less’ than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.” Id. at 545.', '-5- the transfer of Briggs forthwith to the ACI; however, he set the matter down for a post-transfer evidentiary hearing on November 5, 2009—just three days later.', 'On November 5, 2009, although the department was ready to proceed with a hearing, the Mental Health Advocate indicated that he was making a “formal request * * * [to] stay, or in the alternative, actually vacate the order * * * [the trial justice] heard on [November 2, 2009], transferring Mr. Briggs to prison.” The department opposed the motion, and the trial justice took the arguments under advisement. The next day, he issued a bench decision that denied both the Mental Health Advocate’s motion to reconsider as well as the request to transfer Briggs back to the Forensic Unit. 9 The post-transfer evidentiary hearing was then scheduled for November 23, 2009, but it was later rescheduled to November 30, 2009, and then again to December 2, 2009.', 'The hearing commenced on December 2, 2009, and continued to December 10, 2009; January 11, 12, 13, 15, 22, and 29, 2010; and February 5, 2010. 10 During the hearing, testimony was presented by Dr. Pedro F. Tactacan, an attending psychiatrist at the Forensic Unit, and Dr. Underwood, a psychiatrist with the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, about whether Briggs needed any further specialized mental-health services or psychiatric inpatient services. Specifically, Dr. Tactacan testified that Briggs did not presently suffer from a disorder that required inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and treatment. He gave the opinion that Briggs was manipulative and that his behavior was simply an attempt to remain at the Forensic Unit. Similarly, Dr. Underwood, who originally recommended that Briggs be transferred to the 9', 'Briggs immediately appealed, but a duty justice of this Court declined to issue a stay, noting that an evidentiary hearing was pending in the Superior Court.

Doctor Tactacan testified mostly about the technical components of Briggs’s psychiatric analysis, but he also discussed various threats made by Briggs, as well as his manipulative nature. This information was based on Dr. Tactacan’s own one-on-one interactions with Briggs and information gleaned from individuals who appeared to be in fear of Briggs.', 'Monteiro, who was assigned to provide one-on-one supervision of Briggs, testified about one particular incident in which one patient engaged in some inappropriate touching of Briggs, which resulted in a violent outburst. He also testified that he had come to know Briggs, but he did not find Briggs to be a volatile and dangerous individual, which was contrary to what he had been told by other staff members.', 'Gibbs, who was also assigned to provide one-on-one supervision of Briggs, testified about an incident involving Nurse Benfante, in which Briggs followed Nurse Benfante back to the nurses’ station and punched an office window after the pair had engaged in a verbal altercation, precipitated because Briggs had draped a sheet over his head in violation of hospital policy. Nurse Benfante also testified about that incident, and she related Briggs’s specific threats', '-7- that he was going to turn the ward upside down and that there was nothing the ward could do to prevent him from getting to her. 11', 'Finally, Dr. Tate testified. She explained that she was aware of the problems with Briggs, which were escalating, and she expressed concern for the safety of patients and staff. She explained that the most significant incident was the one involving Nurse Benfante and that, based on all the information she had from Nurse Benfante and others, it was her opinion that they needed to remove Briggs from the Forensic Unit.', 'On February 5, 2010, after the last witness had testified, the Mental Health Advocate filed a motion to impose sanctions under Rule 11. In his motion, the Mental Health Advocate alleged misconduct by the department, specifically arguing that the department and the administration of Eleanor Slater Hospital had “contrived a materially inaccurate set of facts in furtherance of a conspiracy to secure a court order for the immediate discharge of [Briggs] from Eleanor Slater Hospital.” The department opposed this motion and argued that uncontroverted evidence was presented by two highly qualified medical experts that Briggs was not in need of the Forensic Unit’s specialized services.', 'The department also argued that the testimony presented during the hearing supported that Briggs’s behavior had created an escalating tension on the Forensic Unit and resulted in at least a perceived emergency by November 2, 2009.', 'On February 19, 2010, the trial justice issued a written decision on the underlying merits and the motion for Rule 11 sanctions. After reviewing the testimony about Briggs’s psychiatric condition, the trial justice found “the testimony of [Dr. Tactacan and Dr. Underwood] * * * credible and forthright,” and that “[a]t the present time, as well as of November 2, 2009, a preponderance of evidence indicates that [Briggs] has sufficiently recovered his mental health 11', 'Incident reports relating to Briggs were also submitted into evidence and reviewed by the trial justice.', '-8- and is no longer in need of specialized psychiatric services that can only be provided at the Forensic Unit.” The trial justice noted that “[t]his particular point was conceded by the Mental Health Advocate at final argument.” 12', 'In examining the Mental Health Advocate’s allegation that the trial justice had been misled about the circumstances surrounding the need to immediately order Briggs back to the ACI prior to a hearing, the trial justice summarized the testimony of each witness and assessed their credibility. The trial justice found that “Dr. Tactacan was very detailed and confident in his testimony regarding his psychiatric analysis of [Briggs].” He indicated that Dr. Tactacan’s “actual testimony as to his own fears falls short of what appears in his affidavit,” and that some of the incidents in Dr. Tactacan’s affidavit that described Briggs’s alleged assaultive and dangerous behavior was “in some contrast” to the incident reports that were submitted on February 5, 2010. The trial justice also noted that Monteiro and Gibbs testified that “their experiences with [Briggs] were not consistent with the information they previously heard about” Briggs’s potential volatile nature. He found Nurse Benfante “clearly appeared to be distraught and in fear” and that she “appeared sincere” in her testimony. Finally, the trial justice noted that he was “impressed with the credibility and sincerity of Dr. Tate,” and that “[i]t [wa]s very clear to the Court that she was very concerned with the safety of the Forensic Unit.”', 'The trial justice ultimately summarized his findings, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“1)', 'The emergency described by [the department] on November', '2, 2009, was not as acute as initially represented.', '“2)', 'The concern of Dr. Tate for the safety and security of the', 'Forensic Unit and patients and staff in such Unit was', 'credible and sincere. 12', 'Indeed, the Mental Health Advocate conceded to the trial justice that he “could not find a doctor on the planet who could look at Mr. Briggs and his psychiatric condition, and conclude that he still needs to be in a hospital,” and, therefore, “the merits of this case [were] no longer in issue.”', '-9-', '“3)', 'Nurse Benfante’s distress is sincere.

This Court has held that “[a] case is moot if it raised a justiciable controversy at the time the complaint was filed, but events occurring after the filing have deprived the litigant of an ongoing', '- 10 - stake in the controversy.” City of Cranston v.

Briggs concedes that the merits of the underlying matter are moot; however, he argues that the procedural issues raised are capable of repetition yet evading review.', '“Although it is not the role of this Court to consider ‘moot, abstract, academic, or hypothetical questions,’ this rule is not absolute.” In re Tavares, 885 A.2d 139, 147 (R.I. 2005) (quoting In re Stephanie B., 826 A.2d 985, 989 (R.I. 2003)). “An exception exists when the issue before this Court is one of great public importance that, although technically moot, is capable of repetition yet evading our review.” Id. This exception to the mootness doctrine involves a two-pronged test. First, a petitioner must demonstrate that the case is of “extreme public importance.” Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d at 533. Circumstances that satisfy this first prong “will usually implicate ‘important constitutional rights, matters concerning a person’s livelihood, or matters concerning citizen voting rights.’” Id. at 533-34 (quoting Cicilline v. Almond, 809 A.2d 1101, 1106 (R.I. 2002)). Second, the petitioner must demonstrate that “the controversy is capable of repetition and will evade review.” Unistrut Corp. v. State Department of Labor and Training, 922 A.2d 93, 99 (R.I. 2007). “A case is ‘capable of repetition yet evading review’ if there is a ‘reasonable expectation that the complaining party [or other similarly situated individuals] would be subjected to the same action again.’” Boyer v.

Briggs has not been readmitted to the Forensic Unit, and there is no indication in the record, nor was there any indication from Briggs’s attorney at oral argument, to support a “reasonable expectation” that he will again be subjected to an emergency removal from the Forensic Unit back to the ACI. See Boyer, 57 A.3d at 281; see also Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 402-03 (1975) (prisoner’s due process challenge, based on a previous transfer from a medium-security prison to a maximum- security prison that occurred without a hearing, was moot because his allegation of another likely transfer was based on mere speculation). Further, the record provides no support of subterfuge or cabal on the part of the department—it was Briggs, by his own actions, who created a danger to staff and other patients at the Forensic Unit to such a degree that the department sought his immediate transfer back to the ACI. Significantly, it was also Briggs who delayed his hearing by pursuing a review of the alleged procedural flaws during the emergency hearing.', 'In addition, until this case—according to the department’s counsel—the department never had petitioned the Superior Court for the emergency transfer of a patient from the Forensic Unit back to the ACI and has not done so since. The Mental Health Advocate produced no evidence to the contrary. The absence of any meaningful evidence as to the likelihood of repetition would require us to engage in speculation and conjecture in order to find that the expectation to the mootness doctrine applies—and we decline to do so. Thus, we conclude that the “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception to mootness does not apply in this case. 13 13', 'We pause to question whether the initiation of this matter by faxed letter, rather than by petition as required by § 40.1-5.3-9, was proper, and, if not, whether the verified petition signed by the department’s director on November 3, 2009—supplemented with supporting documents— cured any defects. We need not reach this issue, however, as Briggs’s claim is moot and does not fall under the narrow mootness exception. Similarly, the Mental Health Advocate argues that', '- 12 -', '2', 'Sanctions', 'Briggs also argues that the trial justice denied his motion for Rule 11 sanctions without providing a discussion of his reasoning and, therefore, that this issue should be remanded for further findings. The department, however, argues that the trial justice’s decision to deny Rule 11 sanctions was supported by both the evidence and the law.', 'Under Rule 11, a trial justice has discretionary authority to formulate what he or she considers to be an appropriate sanction, but he or she must do so in accordance with the articulated purpose of the rule: “to deter repetition of the harm, and to remedy the harm caused.” Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 217 (quoting Michalopoulos v. C & D Restaurant, Inc., 847 A.2d 294, 300 (R.I. 2004)). “As such, this Court will not reverse a trial justice’s imposition [or denial] of sanctions for a litigant’s misconduct unless ‘the trial court based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300). Therefore, we will reverse a trial justice’s decision regarding sanctions only if the trial justice has abused his discretion or is otherwise clearly wrong. Id.', 'The Mental Health Advocate—in only four sentences—argues that we should find that the trial justice abused his discretion because he declined to impose sanctions. However, he offers no substantive argument regarding the manner in which the trial justice may have abused his discretion. He simply argues that the trial justice denied the motion for Rule 11 sanctions “without discussion” and that the trial justice should have allowed his motion because “the way to deter future, exaggerated claims that the sky is falling is to sanction Chicken Little for the trial justice should have analyzed the emergency transfer request under Rule 65 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, because, he alleges, the trial justice entertained what was in substance a request for a temporary restraining order. This is also an issue we need not reach because Briggs’s claim is moot.', '- 13 - improving on the facts extravagantly.” In our view, this sparse assertion offers no reason for this Court to conclude that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the Mental Health Advocate’s motion. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007) (“A mere passing reference to an argument[,] * * * without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.”); Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002).', 'Moreover, after reviewing the record, we note that the trial justice did provide an extensive discussion about his assessment of the credibility of the witness testimony regarding the genuineness of the perceived emergency and safety concerns. After summarizing each witness’s testimony, he concluded that “Dr. Tactacan’s concern for the safety and security of the Forensic Unit and the staff and patients [wa]s also credible and sincere,” “Nurse Benfante’s distress [wa]s sincere,” and “[t]he concern of Dr. Tate for the safety and security of the Forensic Unit and patients and staff in such Unit was credible and sincere.” It was based on these reasons that the trial justice “decline[d] to find a conspiracy among [the department] staff and administration to remove [Briggs] from the Forensic Unit at any and all costs” and denied the motion for Rule 11 sanctions.', 'Accordingly, because the Mental Health Advocate’s naked asseveration, without substantiating authority, is insufficient to place an issue before this Court, we hold that there is no merit to this argument and that the Mental Health Advocate has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied his motion for Rule 11 sanctions.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

The Supreme Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari filed by the petitioners, W. Bart Lloyd (Lloyd) and Elizabeth Lloyd (collectively, petitioners or Lloyds), seeking review of a judgment of the Superior Court affirming the decision of the Zoning Board of Review for the City of Newport (zoning board or board), which granted a special-use permit to Mark Bardorf and Diana Bardorf (respondents or Bardorfs).1 The trial justice decided two consolidated appeals from the zoning board.2', 'However, we granted certiorari only with respect to the decision of the trial justice that affirmed the zoning board‟s grant of a special-use permit to the respondents, the petitioners‟ abutting landowners. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Lloyd appealed the zoning board‟s September 1, 2006 denial of his application for a special-use permit (NC 06-467) to the Superior Court and subsequently appealed the November 28, 2007 decision of the zoning board, which granted a special-use permit to his neighbors, the Bardorfs (NC 07-621). The trial justice‟s decision encompassed both appeals. Only the Bardorf matter is before us. 2', 'The trial justice indicated in his decision that an order granting the motion to consolidate was entered on October 8, 2008, but the record does not reflect that the motion was in fact granted. Nevertheless, the Superior Court‟s decision treats the cases as consolidated, and judgment has entered as to both.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The respondents own property located at 18 Chestnut Street in Newport, Rhode Island, which is zoned R-10, located in the city‟s Historic District, and designated as Lot 249 on Tax Assessor‟s Plat 12. The petitioners own the abutting property at 16 Chestnut Street, which also is zoned R-10.3 The Bardorfs‟ residence is a dimensionally nonconforming development as defined by both § 17.08.010 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Newport (Newport Ordinances or zoning ordinance) and G.L. 1956 § 45-24-31(49) of the Rhode Island Zoning Enabling Act of 1991 (P.L. 1991, ch. 307, § 1) (zoning enabling act).', 'Specifically, it is nonconforming in three respects: lot size, lot coverage, and front setback. The record discloses that in January 1992, the zoning board granted a dimensional variance to allow a former owner of the property to maintain a deck and veranda that had been constructed without a permit and that resulted in an increase in the building‟s lot coverage and a commensurate increase in its dimensional nonconformity. Nonconforming lot coverage and the overall mass of the new structure lay at the heart of this dispute.', 'The Bardorfs purchased the property in December 2006. They planned to live there with their three children and sought to construct a two-story addition that would include another bedroom and expand the first floor. To avoid any “zoning issues,” the Bardorfs hired an architect to develop plans that would conform to the zoning requirements. On May 31, 2007, the Bardorfs filed an application for a special-use permit pursuant to §§ 17.72.030(C) and 17.108.020(G) of the Newport Ordinances. The application proposed the removal of a deck and an existing two-story addition on the rear of their home and the construction of an addition 3', 'R-10 zoning mandates a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet with minimum lot width of eighty feet; minimum setback requirements are fifteen-foot front line, ten-foot side line, and twenty-foot rear line; and the portion of a lot covered by buildings shall not exceed 20 percent.

The Bardorfs also sought to include a deck or veranda off the second-floor bedroom, measuring four feet by eleven feet. The application stated that the addition would otherwise comply with R-10 zoning setback requirements: it would not exceed the thirty-foot height limitation and—because it would replace the previously-authorized veranda and deck—respondents posited that it would result in an actual decrease in building lot coverage from 36 percent to 34 percent. The petitioners objected to the application.', 'The Bardorfs‟ application was considered by the zoning board at two meetings, on October 11 and October 22, 2007.4 In addition to the testimony from the respective parties, both sides presented real-estate experts.', 'Counsel for the Bardorfs asserted that, although the applicants were seeking a special-use permit to construct the four-foot by eleven-foot second- story deck, zoning relief was not necessary to build the addition because it was an alteration that could be made “as a matter of right.”5 Section 17.72.030(C). According to counsel, the Bardorfs applied for both a special-use permit and a variance to “cover[] all of the bases,” but, he contended, according to the zoning ordinance, the Bardorfs were entitled to construct the addition as “a matter of right” because it would not increase the dimensional nonconformity and would otherwise conform to the zoning ordinance‟s dimensional requirements. The zoning board did not pass on this argument, although the trial justice made reference to it in his decision. 4', 'Before the board meetings, the application was approved by the Newport Historic District Commission, which found that the plans were compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and the house itself. 5', 'Section 17.72.030(C), “Alteration to nonconforming development,” states, in pertinent part:', '“Excepting Proposed Decks * * *.

Scotti (Scotti), a real-estate expert, who had reviewed the proposed plans, inspected the property, and examined the petition and applicable zoning regulations. He had considered the characteristics of the neighborhood, the site, the structure itself, and the planning department‟s approval of the plans as consistent with Newport‟s comprehensive plan. Scotti testified that lot size would remain the same, as would the setbacks; the building footprint—its lot coverage—would diminish by approximately 2 percent.', 'He concluded that the proposal met the standard set forth in the zoning ordinance‟s special-use permit section.', 'William E. Coyle III (Coyle) testified as a real-estate expert for petitioners. Like Scotti, Coyle had visited the site, reviewed the proposed plans, the application, the neighborhood, and reports from the planning department and the Historic District Commission. Unlike Scotti, however, Coyle opined that the proposed addition on the rear of the Bardorfs‟ house would reduce neighborhood property values, diminish the Lloyds‟ sunlight, and obstruct their view. Although he maintained that the zoning board should “concern itself with the size and the mass” of the structure to be situated on the lot, Coyle conceded that the zoning ordinance makes no reference to the building mass in determining compliance with the Newport Ordinances.', 'The zoning board unanimously approved the Bardorfs‟ application. The board issued a written decision that set forth its findings and conclusions and declared that, based on the testimony of the parties and their witnesses, as well as the Historic District Commission Staff Report and the Newport planning board‟s determination that the proposal conformed to the city‟s comprehensive community plan, the application was approved.6 6', 'The zoning board‟s findings of fact tracked the language of the zoning ordinance and included the following: the proposed alterations were compatible with the neighborhood and were in harmony with the surrounding area; the physical improvements would be organized in a manner', '-4-', 'The petitioners appealed the decision to the Superior Court; and, in a written decision, a justice of the Superior Court affirmed the board‟s decision. The trial justice found no error on the part of the zoning board in granting a special-use permit; he further found that the board did not err in rejecting petitioners‟ contention that respondents were required to seek a dimensional variance.', 'The trial justice concluded that there was sufficiently reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record before the board to support its decision. An order affirming the decision of the board was entered on September 9, 2009, and judgment entered nunc pro tunc on December 1, 2011.7', 'In his decision, the trial justice first addressed petitioners‟ argument that the zoning board erred in failing to require respondents to seek dimensional relief in conjunction with this application.', 'The trial justice correctly observed that a special use may coexist with a dimensional variance only if both forms of relief coextensively are allowed by the municipality‟s ordinance and that the Newport Ordinances do not contain such a provision; he also found that the zoning board did not err when it refused to apply the dimensional variance standard of review to this application and that the decision of the board was not affected by error of law.', 'The trial justice also rejected petitioners‟ argument that respondents may not alter their building because the addition would increase or intensify the existing nonconformity associated that would allow reasonable use and enjoyment of the property; the improvements would be of an appropriate size and scale as shown on the plans and had earned the approval of the Historic District Commission; the percentage of lot coverage would decrease as a result of the improvement to the structure, and all improvements would conform to all minimum setback requirements; the proposed alterations would not increase or intensify the elements of the property‟s dimensional nonconformities; and the relief sought was a special-use permit. 7', 'The record reflects that judgment was entered in September 2009, but only as to NC 06-467, the case involving petitioners‟ own application for a special-use permit. Consequently, judgment for this matter, NC 07-621, was necessarily nunc pro tunc.

Throughout these proceedings, an increase in the structure‟s size or overall mass has been characterized as the “building envelope.” The petitioners have argued before the zoning board, in Superior Court, and again before this Court, that an increase in a structure‟s mass or “building envelope” is tantamount to an increase in building lot coverage under the ordinance. The trial justice contrasted the definitions of “building envelope” and “lot building coverage” as set forth in the zoning ordinance. He noted that § 17.08.010 of the zoning ordinance defines the term “[b]uilding envelope” as “the three-dimensional space within which a structure is permitted to be built on a lot and which is defined by regulations governing building setbacks, maximum height, and bulk” and that the term “lot building coverage” was defined as “that portion of the lot that is or may be covered by buildings and accessory buildings.” 8 He concluded that each term has independent meaning and that the terms were not intended to be used interchangeably.', 'Before this Court, petitioners contend that the zoning ordinance was misapplied and that the Bardorfs should have been required to obtain a dimensional variance rather than a special-use permit. Second, petitioners assert that allowing the Bardorfs to make use of lot coverage that was authorized by a previously-obtained dimensional variance was error. Third, petitioners argue that the failure to evaluate whether the proposed addition would constitute an intensification of the nonconforming lot coverage was erroneous. Finally, petitioners maintain that the record evidence does not support the granting of a special-use permit.

Hellewell, 560 A.2d 353, 354 (R.I. 1989).', 'Analysis', 'Expansion as a Matter of Right', 'We address at the outset the argument that respondents were entitled to expand their dimensionally nonconforming development “as a matter of right” and whether the zoning board made such a determination. Specifically, ordinance provision § 17.72.030(C) contains three discrete paragraphs which are not identified separately; we shall refer to them as paragraphs one, two, and three of § 17.72.030(C). Section 17.72.030(C) provides:', '“No nonconforming use of land or nonconforming use of a', 'structure shall be changed except to a conforming use or structure.', 'No nonconforming use of land or nonconforming use of a', 'structure, if once changed to conform, shall thereafter be changed', 'so as to be nonconforming by use again.', '“Dimensionally nonconforming―Excepting Proposed', 'Decks (as defined in the Rhode Island State Building Code and', 'regulations adopted thereby). Alteration to dimensionally', 'nonconforming structures that otherwise conform to the use', '-8-', 'regulations of the zoning district shall be allowed as a matter of', 'right if the alteration in and of itself: (1) conforms to the current', 'dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the', 'property is located, and (2) does not increase or intensify the', 'element(s) of the dimensional nonconformity.', '“A structure or land which is nonconforming by dimension,', 'but the use of which is a use permitted by right in the district in', 'which the land or structure is located, shall only be altered,', 'changed, enlarged or subject to addition or intensification with', 'respect to its nonconforming element(s) by obtaining a special use', 'permit from the zoning board of review.”', 'Accordingly, an expansion of a nonconforming structure that falls within paragraph two of § 17.72.030(C) is allowed “as a matter of right” and does not require application to or approval by the zoning board; a building permit generally is granted by the appropriate building official. In this case, respondents applied for and received a special-use permit from the zoning board in order to construct a significant addition to a dimensionally nonconforming structure. By doing so, they invoked the jurisdiction of the zoning board. In issuing its decision, the board did not declare, as petitioners contend, that respondents were entitled to the expansion “as a matter of right.” Rather, the board applied the appropriate criteria set forth in the zoning ordinance for the grant of a special-use permit. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred when he concluded that the zoning board allowed the expansion “as a matter of right.” This error is of no moment, however, because the trial justice also carefully examined the sufficiency of the zoning board‟s decision in light of the criteria set forth in the zoning ordinance and concluded that the special-use permit properly was granted.', 'The Special-Use Permit', 'The petitioners assert that both the zoning board and the trial justice erred in applying the standard governing a special-use permit to the Bardorfs‟ application. The Bardorfs argue that they applied for both a special-use permit and a variance only to “cover[] all of the bases” and', '-9- that they were seeking a special-use permit only to construct the second-story deck. They argue that they did not need zoning relief to construct the remaining portion of the addition because it was an alteration that could be made “as a matter of right.” However, this “belt and suspenders” argument is not supported by the record before this Court. The respondents‟ written application makes no reference to a second-story deck, nor does it suggest that they are entitled to this relief as a matter of right. Accordingly, we are satisfied that respondents sought and obtained a special-use permit for their proposed project. Therefore, we shall address whether a special-use permit was the appropriate relief and, if so, whether it properly was granted.', 'The zoning enabling act, set forth in chapter 24 of title 45 of the General Laws, mandates that local zoning ordinances provide for the issuance of special-use permits, to be approved by the zoning board of review. See § 45-24-42(a). Generally, a special-use permit relates to a specific use the owner wishes to undertake on the parcel―a use that is not allowed under the ordinance absent zoning board approval. See § 45-24-31(57) (defining “special use” as “[a] regulated use which is permitted pursuant to the special-use permit issued by the authorized governmental entity, pursuant to § 45-24-42”).', 'In addition to establishing procedural requirements for obtaining a special-use permit, municipal zoning ordinances must:', '“(1) Specify the uses requiring special-use permits in each district;', '“(2) Describe the conditions and procedures under which special-', 'use permits, of each or [sic] the various categories of special-use', 'permits established in the zoning ordinance, may be issued;', '“(3) Establish criteria for the issuance of each category of special-', 'use permit that shall be in conformance with the purposes and', 'intent of the comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance of the', 'city or town;', '“(4) Provide for public hearings and notification of the date, time,', '- 10 -', 'place, and purpose of those hearings to interested parties * * *;', '“(5) Provide for the recording of findings of fact and written', 'decisions; and', '“(6) Provide that appeals may be taken pursuant to § 45-24-70.”', 'Section 45-24-42(b). The Newport Ordinances, however, are not confined to proposed uses; the Newport Ordinances also require a special-use permit in order to expand a dimensionally nonconforming structure. Although this approach may give rise to confusion, the ordinance specifically provides that an alteration of a nonconforming development requires a special-use permit as set forth in § 17.72.030(C).9', 'The criteria for the issuance of a special-use permit is set forth in § 17.108.020(G), which provides:', '“Special use permits shall be granted only where the zoning board', 'of review finds that the proposed use or the proposed extension or', 'alteration of an existing use is in accord with the public', 'convenience and welfare, after taking into account, where', 'appropriate:', '“1.

This Court has declared that these standards essentially are conditions precedent to the board‟s exercise of its authority to act affirmatively on an application for a special-use permit. See Guiberson v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 112 R.I. 252, 258, 308 A.2d 503, 506 (1973). When the conditions precedent are satisfied, it is an abuse of discretion to deny the requested special-use permit. See Salve Regina College v. Zoning Board of Review of Newport, 594 A.2d 878, 882 (R.I. 1991).', 'In this case, petitioners argue that the dimensional variance standard is more stringent than that required for a special-use permit; we disagree.

Although petitioners insisted that the Bardorfs were required to seek a dimensional variance, the zoning board declined to apply this standard to the Bardorfs‟ application. The trial justice agreed with the zoning board. Our careful review of the relevant ordinances convinces us that a special- use permit was the appropriate relief in this case.', 'The record is clear: respondents sought zoning board approval to alter and increase a dimensionally nonconforming development, as that term is defined in the ordinance. According to the ordinance, the appropriate form of relief for a party seeking to expand a dimensionally nonconforming structure is a special-use permit. We conclude that the zoning board granted the application that was before it, a special-use permit.', 'The 1992 Variance', 'The petitioners next allege that the trial justice overlooked “the effect of the sources” of the nonconforming lot coverage.', 'According to petitioners, the trial justice should have considered how the parcel “came to be so significantly overburdened.” This argument centers on the 1992 dimensional variance and whether that variance, which increased lot coverage by 5 percent, was a factor that should have been considered in granting the special-use permit or whether it was a disqualifying event.', 'Specifically, petitioners contend that the Bardorfs improperly were permitted to bootstrap “the mere authorization of a harmless deck pursuant to', '- 13 - the 1992 [v]ariance into a very broad authorization for a two-story building,” which, they contend, is in contravention of § 17.72.030(D) of the Newport Ordinances.10 The petitioners argue that any alteration to the deck that was the subject of the 1992 dimensional variance could only occur if further dimensional relief was granted. We deem this incorrect.', 'This Court previously has declared that “a dimensional variance [may] be granted only in connection with the enjoyment of a legally permitted beneficial use, [and] not in conjunction with a use granted by special permit.” Newton v. Zoning Board of Review of Warwick, 713 A.2d 239, 242 (R.I. 1998). After our decision in Newton, the Legislature amended chapter 24 of title 45 to address situations in which both dimensional variances and special-use permits could be allowed, but only if the zoning ordinance so provided. Section 45-24-42(c) provides:', '“The ordinance additionally may provide that an applicant', 'may apply for, and be issued, a dimensional variance in', 'conjunction with a special use. If the special use could not exist', 'without the dimensional variance, the zoning board of review shall', 'consider the special use permit and the dimensional variance', 'together to determine if granting the special use is appropriate', 'based on both the special use criteria and the dimensional variance', 'evidentiary standards.” Meanwhile, § 45-24-41(d)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he zoning board of review has the power to grant dimensional variances where the use is permitted by special use permit if provided for in the special use permit sections of the zoning ordinance.”', 'Reading these sections together, we agree with the trial justice that the General Assembly intended that a use granted by special-use permit may coexist with a dimensional variance only when a municipality‟s zoning ordinance so provides. The Newport Ordinances do not allow a special-use permit and dimensional variance to be granted in conjunction with each other. In this 10', 'Section 17.72.030(D) reads: “A use established by variance or special use permit shall not acquire the rights of this section.”', '- 14 - case, however, the dimensional variance was granted fifteen years before application was made for a special-use permit. This circumstance is inapposite to our holding in Newton, 713 A.2d at 240, because, in this case, respondents did not seek permission to engage in a use of the property that required the approval of the zoning board. The respondents applied for permission to expand a dimensionally nonconforming structure—for a permitted use—and that was the issue that was addressed by the zoning board. The board agreed with respondents that the percentage of lot coverage would decrease as a result of the proposed addition and that the proposal, including the second-floor deck, constituted “minimum requests for the reasonable use of the property.” We discern no error in this conclusion.', 'Furthermore, contrary to petitioners‟ contention, the 1992 dimensional variance was neither limited nor conditioned in any way, and there is no evidence that any express terms or special conditions were incorporated into the board‟s approval. See § 45-24-43 (providing, in pertinent part, that where a zoning board of review grants a variance, the board may apply special conditions that “may include, but are not limited to, provisions for * * * [m]inimizing the adverse impact of the development upon other land”); see also Town of Warren v. Frost, 111 R.I. 217, 220, 301 A.2d 572, 573 (1973) (noting that the enabling legislation authorized a zoning board to impose “reasonable conditions” when granting a variance). In this case, the application sought “a variance to the dimensional requirements for permission to maintain a 12‟ X 13‟ veranda and an 8‟ X 13‟ porch.” However, petitioners argue that the variance merely allowed the owners to “maintain” the structure and that if the deck is not preserved or “maintained,” the variance is lost. We disagree. The 1992 decision that allowed a prior owner to maintain a deck and veranda means simply that: the deck and veranda originally were built in contravention of the zoning ordinance, such that the owners were required to obtain a dimensional variance in', '- 15 - order to preserve the structure. There were no express conditions attached to the relief granted by the board.', 'We are of the opinion that neither the Superior Court nor the zoning board erred as a matter of law in allowing the Bardorfs to utilize the expanded lot coverage authorized by this 1992 dimensional variance.', 'Intensification of the Nonconformity', 'The petitioners next argue that the two-story addition11 to a dimensionally nonconforming structure would “increase or intensify” the nonconformity associated with lot building coverage and was erroneously granted by the zoning board.12 The petitioners suggest that an increase in the mass of a structure or in the square footage of a structure‟s “building envelope” is akin to an increase in a structure‟s “lot building coverage,” even with no change in the “footprint” of the building. In fact, petitioners contend that the mass of a structure, or its density or bulk, must be taken into consideration when calculating the portion of the lot covered by buildings. Although these factors may be good policy considerations, they are not addressed in the Newport Ordinances.', 'The petitioners‟ contention that an increase in the three-dimensional space above the site of the proposed addition would “intensify” the building lot coverage wholly depends on whether “building envelope” and “lot building coverage” are synonymous terms. The zoning board, however, did not accept that proposition. Rather, the zoning board concluded that, despite an increase in “bulk” of the overall structure, the proposed two-story addition would result in a 11', 'At oral argument, it was revealed that the addition has been constructed. 12', 'The Newport Ordinances do not define “intensification,” which appears in § 17.72.030(C), “Alteration to nonconforming development.”', '- 16 - decrease in “lot coverage.”', 'Unfortunately for petitioners, the bulk or overall mass of the structure are not proper considerations under Newport‟s zoning ordinance.', 'The trial justice likewise rejected petitioners‟ argument that the Bardorfs were precluded from altering the structure because it would increase or intensify the existing nonconformity associated with lot building coverage. The Newport Ordinances define “lot building coverage” as “that portion of the lot that is or may be covered by buildings and accessory buildings.” Section 17.08.010. That definition is confined to the two-dimensional lot coverage and is distinct from the definition of “building envelope,” which is defined in terms of three- dimensional space. The zoning ordinance fails to address building density. Therefore, the trial justice reasoned that, “[b]ased on the unambiguous language of § 17.08.010 of the Newport [Ordinances] and its corollary, § 45-24-31 of the [G]eneral [L]aws, it is clear that the drafters of the [zoning ordinance] did not intend for the terms „building envelope‟ and „lot building coverage‟ to be employed interchangeably.” We agree with the trial justice‟s reasoning: “„Lot building coverage‟ is a two-dimensional concept, encompassing the total area of the lot covered by buildings and accessory buildings; it does not contemplate a vertical dimension.” In fact, as the trial justice observed, this conclusion is consistent with the zoning ordinance‟s definition of “lot” as “[a] parcel of land whose boundaries have been established by some legal instrument.” Section 17.08.010.', 'We discern no error in the trial justice‟s analysis.', 'The zoning ordinance does not contemplate a calculation of building mass or three-dimensional spaces in the criteria for alterations of dimensionally nonconforming structures. The city could, of course, consistent with its enabling authority, more carefully define “intensification” or amend its zoning ordinance to incorporate a three-dimensional calculation into lot coverage concepts and thereby more', '- 17 - equitably, and perhaps more fairly, evaluate proposals such as those contained in respondents‟ application for zoning relief.13', 'D', 'Sufficiency of Record Evidence', 'Finally, petitioners contend that the zoning board‟s analysis was incomplete and that the grant of the special-use permit was therefore erroneous. In addition, petitioners argue that the evidence did not support the ultimate conclusion. In support of these contentions, petitioners cite to the expert testimony they proffered at the zoning board hearing.', 'The trial justice reviewed the evidence and determined that the zoning board‟s decision was “amply supported by legally competent record evidence.” He concluded that the members of the board “made an informed and record-supported decision after reviewing the conflicting expert testimony [and] that the requirements of § 17.108.020(G)(1) of the Newport Code had been satisfied.” It is well settled that a fact-finder is free to accept or reject the testimony of an expert witness.

In this case, the zoning board accepted the testimony of the respondents‟ expert witness, a decision that was within the board‟s discretion. The trial justice carefully and comprehensively considered the 13', 'For instance, Barrington‟s ordinance provides that “[a]ny increase in the volume or intensity of use unaccompanied by a structural change of the premises shall not be considered an extension, addition to or enlargement of a nonconforming use.” Barrington Zoning Ordinance, § 185- 33(A).

Mead (Mead or plaintiff) appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of her motion for a new trial. Mead argues that the trial justice erred in denying that motion because the evidence preponderated against the jury’s verdict. This case came before the Supreme Court on February 28, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The section of U.S. Route 44 that runs through East Providence is known as Taunton Avenue. That stretch of the road traverses a commercial area where pedestrian traffic is not unusual. It is a two-lane road divided by a double yellow line with parking on both sides, and features several crosswalks.', '-1-', 'At approximately 2 p.m. on August 26, 2005, Mead was crossing Taunton Avenue on foot when she was struck by a sport-utility vehicle traveling in the eastbound lane, driven by defendant, Eric J. McNamara (McNamara or defendant). Mead was struck as she attempted to cross from a Shell gas station, on the southerly side of Taunton Avenue, to Sovereign Bank, on the northerly side, where she was employed at the time. Tragically, the extent of Mead’s injuries required doctors to amputate her left leg above the knee.', 'On July 31, 2006, Mead filed a complaint in the Providence County Superior Court against McNamara, alleging negligence. She also named ARI Fleet LT, Inc., the owner of the vehicle, as a defendant. In 2008, she amended her complaint, removing ARI Fleet LT, Inc. and naming Sanofi-Aventis U.S., Inc., McNamara’s employer at the time of the accident, as a defendant. (McNamara had been on his way to a sales appointment on behalf of Sanofi-Aventis U.S., Inc. when the accident occurred.)', 'A jury trial commenced on June 21, 2010. We summarize below the relevant, and at times conflicting, testimony adduced at trial. Because this appeal does not involve a question as to damages, we do not discuss any testimony regarding the extent of Mead’s injuries.', 'Mead, McNamara, and Michael DaSilva, an eyewitness to the accident, testified at trial. The deposition testimony of a second eyewitness, Jason Gomes, was read to the jury. Additionally, the video deposition testimony of a third eyewitness, Helder Cunha, was also played for the jury.', 'Mead testified that she did not remember anything about the accident itself or the immediately preceding events. She stated, though, that she regularly crossed Taunton Avenue to visit the convenience store at the Shell gas station across the street from Sovereign Bank. She further acknowledged that there was not a crosswalk between the bank and the gas station;', '-2- however, she averred that, before crossing that part of Taunton Avenue, she customarily would “[w]ait, see if cars were coming, and then cross.”', 'DaSilva testified that, on the day of the accident, he was driving in the westbound lane of Taunton Avenue. 1 He recalled that it “was a medium traffic day” and that “[traffic] was just starting to pick up” before the accident. While driving, he saw Mead walk toward the edge of the street, come to a stop, and “look[ ] both ways” as she waited to cross. However, on cross- examination, DaSilva was confronted with his deposition testimony, in which he stated that he had not observed Mead look to both her left and her right before crossing the street.', 'DaSilva further testified that, upon noticing Mead waiting to cross, he stopped his car, made eye contact with her, extended his arm out the window of his car, and waved for her to cross. He stated that he did so “because there was plenty of time for her to cross in [his] mind.” He acknowledged, though, that before he waved her across, he observed McNamara’s “blue Ford vehicle,” which was stopped at a traffic light. He recalled that McNamara’s vehicle was headed in the opposite direction and was about “a quarter of a mile down the road” when he waved for Mead to cross. DaSilva was later impeached on this point with his deposition testimony, in which he stated that McNamara’s vehicle had traveled only about two or three car lengths before hitting Mead.', 'DaSilva testified that, after he waved for Mead to cross, she then walked between two vehicles parked on the southerly side of Taunton Avenue—a red truck and a silver car—as she entered the street. He recalled that Mead began to cross at a “fast[-]paced walk” and that she took only “two or three steps” into the street before McNamara’s vehicle struck her, which 1', 'DaSilva actually testified that he was driving east on Taunton Avenue; however, he also stated that he was traveling from Seekonk, Massachusetts, toward Providence, Rhode Island. We therefore have inferred that DaSilva was in fact traveling in the westbound lane of Taunton Avenue. This inference has been corroborated by the other eyewitness testimony.', '-3- caused her to “fl[y] through the air.” DaSilva testified that he did not hear McNamara’s vehicle skid before striking Mead and did not see any skid marks on the street after the accident.', 'As stated above, Cunha’s video deposition testimony was played for the jury. Cunha testified that he was driving behind DaSilva’s vehicle in the westbound lane when the accident occurred. He recalled that, because it was “rush hour,” the traffic was moving at a “relatively slow” rate of speed. As Cunha approached behind DaSilva’s vehicle, he noticed Mead standing in the street “within half a foot” of the curb in front of a parked red truck. He testified that he observed Mead “looking at traffic, and * * * waiting for an opportunity to cross.” He further testified that “[a]t no point did [Mead] acknowledge eastbound” traffic while she waited to cross. Cunha stated that he then stopped his car behind DaSilva’s for approximately “twenty to sixty seconds” and that he saw DaSilva wave Mead across the street.', 'According to Cunha, Mead then acknowledged DaSilva’s wave by “wav[ing] her right hand saying, basically, thank you.” Cunha testified that, after Mead acknowledged DaSilva’s wave, she then “sprint[ed]” across the street and took approximately “[t]hree to four” steps into the street before McNamara’s vehicle struck her, causing her to “cartwheel in the air.” He further noted that Mead did not “take into consideration oncoming traffic” before she “popped right out” into the street. Cunha, like DaSilva, testified that he did not hear McNamara’s vehicle skid and did not notice any skid marks in the street after the accident. He recalled that he did not observe McNamara’s vehicle before it actually struck Mead.', 'McNamara testified that, just before the accident, he was traveling in the eastbound lane of Taunton Avenue in a blue Ford Escape. Consistent with the testimony of the other witnesses, he testified that the traffic that day was “steady” and “heavy.” He recalled that his vehicle was the first one stopped at a traffic light “down near [c]ity [h]all,” which he estimated was about', '-4- “500 or 600 feet” from where his vehicle struck Mead. After that traffic light changed to green, McNamara traveled at a speed of “between 20 [to] 25 miles per hour” for approximately ten to fifteen seconds. McNamara recalled that just prior to the accident he “saw traffic” in the westbound lane; however, he equivocated when asked whether he observed DaSilva’s vehicle stopped in that lane. He never stated that he saw DaSilva waving to Mead to cross the street, or acknowledged that he ever saw Mead standing on the side of Taunton Avenue.', 'According to McNamara, Mead suddenly emerged from between two parked vehicles located to the right of his vehicle. He testified that he saw Mead for “[m]aybe a second” before his vehicle struck her.', 'He then stopped his vehicle at “just about the point of impact.”', 'He recalled that, when his vehicle struck Mead, she “went onto [his] hood and then was projected forward and landed on the ground.”', 'He testified that Mead was not in a crosswalk when the accident occurred.', 'As previously noted, Gomes’s deposition testimony was read to the jury. He testified that, immediately before the accident, he was driving about two car lengths behind McNamara’s vehicle in the eastbound lane. He “vaguely” remembered approaching the traffic light near city hall but could not remember whether that traffic light was green or red at the time or if he had stopped his vehicle there. He also stated that there was a “steady flow” of traffic, that he was driving “[t]wenty-five miles an hour,” and that McNamara’s vehicle was traveling at “[a]round the same” rate of speed.', 'Gomes testified that he observed Mead “right through the * * * rear window” of one of the parked vehicles on his right. He stated that he saw Mead walk from the gas station toward the street and that Mead did not look in the direction from which he and McNamara approached before she began to cross. According to Gomes, Mead “just didn’t stop” before crossing the', '-5- street. Consistent with McNamara’s testimony, Gomes testified that he did not see DaSilva’s vehicle stopped in the opposite lane and did not see DaSilva wave at Mead to cross the street. Gomes testified that he then saw Mead take approximately “two steps” into the street before she was struck by McNamara’s vehicle. He recalled that he could clearly see Mead as she was struck.', 'On June 29, 2010, after seven days of trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants. Mead then moved for a new trial, pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. On July 7, 2010, after hearing arguments, the trial justice denied Mead’s motion for a new trial. In her bench decision, the trial justice found that “[t]he evidence on liability was conflicting” and that “none of the witnesses w[as] entirely credible.” She noted that McNamara “equivocated when asked if he saw the DaSilva vehicle stopped” and that the evidence about whether Mead stopped to look at eastbound traffic before she attempted to cross the street was contradictory.', 'Likewise, the trial justice did not find DaSilva to be a credible witness, noting that his testimony was “successfully impeached on several points.”', 'Additionally, the trial justice recognized that DaSilva had a possible “motive to color the events,” given that he was responsible for waving Mead across the street, where she ultimately suffered serious injuries. She noted that, at the time of the accident, DaSilva “was young and presumably a fairly inexperienced driver,” so he was likely not “thinking of oncoming traffic when he waved [Mead across].” 2 The trial justice therefore “gave no weight to” DaSilva’s testimony that it was safe for Mead to cross the street. Moreover, the trial justice stated that Mead was struck after taking only 2', 'The trial justice indicated that DaSilva was eighteen or nineteen years old at the time of the accident.', '-6- a few steps into the street, which clearly indicated that it was not actually safe for her to have crossed.', 'Importantly, although the trial justice found that DaSilva had stopped to allow Mead to cross and that two other eyewitnesses also observed Mead attempting to cross the street, in her view, “that [did not] necessarily mean” that McNamara could have also seen Mead from his vantage point. The trial justice further relied on Cunha’s testimony that “there was no screech of brakes, [and] no skid marks” in inferring that McNamara “never had a chance to apply his brakes before he hit [Mead].”', 'The trial justice determined that “it was impossible to say that the evidence preponderated in [Mead’s] favor on the question of negligence and proximate cause.” She stated that she was “unable to add to the evidence by drawing inferences favorable to the plaintiff” because there was not enough evidence “to conclude that McNamara was doing something other than what he should [have been] doing,” such as “speeding” or “reading a map.” She also stated that, even if she were to find that McNamara was negligent, she “couldn’t conclude that [this] negligence was necessarily a proximate cause of the accident.”', 'In sum, the trial justice concluded that “reasonable minds could differ over this evidence” and that she “would not have reached a different result” from that reached by the jury. Accordingly, she denied Mead’s motion for a new trial. An order to that effect was entered on July 15, 2010. Mead then timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Mead contends that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial because the evidence preponderated against the jury’s verdict. In support of this argument, Mead', '-7- asserts that the trial justice failed to give sufficient weight to the evidence that DaSilva, Gomes, and Cunha—three eyewitnesses who each viewed the accident from different vantage points—all observed her while she attempted to cross the street before McNamara’s vehicle struck her. In light of this uncontroverted testimony, Mead avers that the jury should have concluded that McNamara likewise should have seen her as she attempted to cross and that his failure to keep a proper lookout proved that he was negligent in striking her.', 'Further, Mead argues that the trial justice overlooked the police photographs that were submitted into evidence. Mead contends that the location of McNamara’s vehicle—near the double yellow line on Taunton Avenue—demonstrates that she must have been further than a few steps into the street when she was struck. According to Mead, these photographs show that McNamara had time to avoid striking her and that therefore he was negligent.', 'Countering Mead’s contentions on appeal, defendants maintain that the trial justice did not err in denying her motion for a new trial. They point out that Mead presented no evidence that McNamara was speeding or was otherwise negligent. Moreover, the evidence adduced at trial indicated that McNamara had no time to avoid striking her. The defendants emphasize that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Mead caused the accident by darting out into the street without looking to see whether any vehicles were approaching in the eastbound lane. They further maintain that the photographic evidence does not prove that McNamara was negligent. Indeed, defendants contend that the photographs corroborate the eyewitness testimony that Mead took only a few steps into the street before she was struck by the right side of McNamara’s vehicle.', '-8-', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'In deciding whether to grant a motion for a new trial, a trial justice, in the exercise of his or her independent judgment, assumes the role “of a superjuror, who must weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” McGarry v.

Winoker, 589 A.2d 824, 829 (R.I. 1991)).', '-9-', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we cannot disagree with the trial justice’s conclusion that Mead failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that McNamara was negligent. The trial justice stated:', '“The mere fact that [McNamara] didn’t see [Mead', 'attempting to cross the street] does not necessarily mean that he', 'was negligent. The fact finders are required to view evidence in', 'the light of their common sense. We all know that drivers * * *', 'can’t sweep with their eyes constantly. They look here. They look', 'there. They look down the road. They perceive something. They', 'might misperceive something else. It’s all happening very, very', 'quickly, even at slow speeds. The problem is we don’t really know', 'what happened here. We know that he didn’t see her, but the mere', 'fact that he didn’t see her doesn’t necessarily mean he breached his', 'duty to look and to try to see, digest and comprehend everything', 'that was going on around him.” Although three eyewitnesses apparently saw Mead waiting to cross the street, the trial justice reasoned that this did not establish McNamara’s negligence in failing to observe her. We agree.', 'We likewise cannot say that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong in making credibility determinations. She recognized DaSilva’s “motive to color the events” surrounding the accident because he had encouraged Mead to cross the street when it was not safe for her to have done so. She also found that various witnesses had testified inconsistently as to whether Mead actually stopped and looked to her left, in the direction of eastbound traffic, before crossing Taunton Avenue. Finally, the trial justice stated that, based on the evidence presented, she could not conclude that McNamara was speeding or doing anything—such as reading a map or looking for a radio station—that would have distracted his attention from the road ahead. The trial justice properly assessed each', '- 10 - witness’s credibility and testimony and determined that Mead had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that McNamara was negligent.', 'Furthermore, we do not agree with Mead’s argument that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence in not addressing the photographs (taken immediately after the accident occurred) in her decision denying Mead’s motion for a new trial. 3 During the trial, Mead’s counsel had introduced the photographs to show the jury where the various witnesses were positioned at the approximate time of the accident, as well as to show the jury where each witness claimed Mead was standing before she attempted to cross the street. Mead now uses those photographs to raise a novel argument to this Court. She contends that the location of McNamara’s vehicle after the accident, as portrayed in those photographs, demonstrates that McNamara must have been negligent in striking her.', 'However, our review of the record reveals that Mead failed to raise that argument below. It is well settled “that a matter not raised before the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal.” Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565, 586-87 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Chase v. Bouchard, 671 A.2d 794, 795 (R.I. 1996)). We therefore deem Mead’s argument—that the photographs demonstrate McNamara’s negligence—to be waived.', 'In sum, we hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in ruling that reasonable minds could disagree about whether McNamara could or should have seen Mead before his vehicle struck her. Further, the trial justice did not overlook material evidence when she did not 3', 'Although the photographs were not explicitly admitted as full exhibits in the record, they were marked as such. Given the stenographer’s note at the beginning of the transcript that “other exhibits were marked off the record,” as well as the use of the photographs in each witness’s testimony at trial, we infer that these photographs were, in fact, admitted as full exhibits before trial and would have been available to the trial justice in considering Mead’s motion for a new trial.', '- 11 - specifically address the photographs.

The defendant, Julie Long, appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding her guilty of manufacturing or cultivating marijuana in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(a)(1), (4)(i). After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In October of 2008, defendant and her boyfriend, Joseph Vaillancourt (Vaillancourt), rented a house at 5 Hillside Drive (Hillside Drive) in Exeter, Rhode Island. The house was owned by Randy Randall. About a month later, sometime in November 2008, defendant met Mark Belenkii (Belenkii) at Saudin Hodzic‟s (Hodzic) Arlington, Massachusetts residence. Belenkii, an enterprising individual and Russian immigrant, was operating a transportation', '-1- business and laundromat, working as a real estate agent, and trafficking in hundreds of pounds of marijuana that was imported from Canada, to be distributed in the Boston area. After the events of this case unfolded and before defendant‟s trial, Belenkii entered into a cooperation agreement with the United States Attorney‟s Office. Thereafter, at trial, Belenkii testified that he went to Hodzic‟s residence in November 2008 to meet with defendant, along with John Belanger (Belanger), Hodzic, and a man named “Joe;” the purpose of that meeting was to discuss “the house in Rhode Island where a larger type of a grow operation could take place or potentially take place.” Belenkii also testified that, at this meeting, Hodzic explained to defendant and those present the growing process and the approximate yield per plant.1 According to Belenkii, defendant stated that the house‟s well would need to be fixed in order to facilitate a bigger operation.', 'He further testified that in December 2008, there was another meeting—this time attended by defendant, Belanger, and Belenkii in order to discuss the marijuana operation. Several weeks later, Belenkii and Hodzic purchased supplies and met defendant in Attleboro, Massachusetts. The supplies were loaded in defendant‟s car, and defendant and Hodzic set off for Rhode Island.', 'In February 2009, Belenkii and Hodzic drove to Rhode Island with equipment for the grow operation, where they met defendant and “Joe” in West Greenwich and followed them to Hillside Drive. At defendant‟s direction, Hodzic and Belenkii deposited the equipment in the basement. The defendant had one of two keys to the basement door. While in the basement, 1', 'United States Drug Enforcement Administration Agent James McCormack (Agent McCormack) estimated that each of the 173 plants seized from Hillside Drive would produce approximately one ounce of marijuana, which would translate to a total of “a little over [ten] pounds” of marijuana. That estimation led to his “conservative” calculation that the 173 plants would yield roughly $25,000.', '-2- Hodzic and Belenkii toured the grow operation, inspecting its structures, equipment, ventilation system, grow lights, and a partition separating two grow areas. According to Belenkii, Hodzic declared that he was pleased to have “a really large place [so] he can grow more plants.” When defendant informed him that she needed money for rent, Belenkii gave defendant $1,700.', 'After the February visit to Hillside Drive, Belenkii and defendant spoke on the phone about every other day. According to Belenkii, defendant would notify him when she needed money to pay the rent and utility bills. The defendant also informed him when the plants needed to be watered and cared for and that she intended to have Hodzic visit the house to perform those tasks. During the ensuing months, Belenkii testified that he visited Hillside Drive “[a]bout [twelve] times” and, on at least one occasion, he observed marijuana plants in the basement when defendant was present.', 'As the Exeter operations progressed, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was conducting an investigation into the distribution of marijuana smuggled from Canada into the United States. Belenkii‟s and Hodzic‟s enterprise fell within the purview of this investigation. At trial, DEA Special Agent Gregg Willoughby (Agent Willoughby) testified that at least thirty agents were involved in an investigation of an organization based in Canada that was smuggling high-grade marijuana into various New England states. The DEA‟s investigation included both actual surveillance of Belenkii and Hodzic, as well as wiretap surveillance to intercept Belenkii‟s phone conversations. It was during those conversations that the agents heard Belenkii and Hodzic discuss going “south”—a term that was used in connection with the Exeter address. Based on surveillance and photographs, agents placed a car registered to Hodzic‟s wife at Hillside Drive. A subpoena was issued to National Grid, seeking information relating to the house at Hillside Drive; the response revealed that defendant was the named subscriber and that', '-3- the electrical usage was substantially higher than that of neighboring homes on Hillside Drive.', 'Agent Willoughby next contacted Warwick Police Detective Robert Page (Det. Page), who was assigned to a DEA High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force. Detective Page set about obtaining a search warrant for 5 Hillside Drive. On June 16, 2009, a United States magistrate signed a search warrant for that address; and, accordingly, Det. Page and other DEA agents executed the search warrant at 6:00 a.m. on June 17, 2009.2 Also on June 17, 2009, Belenkii was arrested during the execution of another search warrant at a Boston apartment.', 'Meanwhile, at Hillside Drive, police seized 173 marijuana plants, a digital scale, various pipes and implements used to smoke marijuana, a rifle, and a suitcase containing fireworks, as well as defendant‟s passport and employee identification badge. Three of the four vehicles parked on the property were traced to defendant and her boyfriend, Vaillancourt.3', 'Two marijuana grow operations were located, one in the basement and another in a second-floor bedroom.', 'On February 15, 2010, a four-count criminal information was filed, charging defendant with (1) one count of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver; (2) one count of manufacturing or cultivating marijuana; (3) one count of committing a crime of violence when armed with or having available a firearm; and (4) one count of possessing or controlling Class 2', 'The affidavit of Det. Page, filed in support of the application for the search warrant, outlined a sweeping federal investigation into what had been identified as a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation. That investigation included extensive surveillance and wiretapping, and it revealed Belenkii as a central target of the investigation. 3', 'None of the vehicles on the property had license plates at the time of the search. However, the vehicle identification number (VIN number) on a black sedan on the property indicated that the sedan was owned by defendant; the VIN numbers on a black pickup truck and a silver pickup truck both identified Vaillancourt as the owner of those vehicles. The black sedan was not registered at the time of the search, nor did the pickup trucks have current Rhode Island registrations.', '-4- “B” or Class “C” fireworks. Subsequently, on November 9, 2010, the state dismissed counts three and four, the firearm and fireworks offenses.', 'The defendant testified at trial. She denied any knowledge of or involvement in the marijuana grow operations. The defendant testified that she and Vaillancourt moved to Block Island on December 28, 2008 after boxing up all of their belongings at Hillside Drive. According to defendant, during her time on Block Island, she sublet the house to Hodzic. She returned to Exeter only to retrieve rent from Hodzic and pay rent to the landlord. She also testified that she knew Belenkii because he was introduced to her as Hodzic‟s driver; Belenkii was at “that house in Massachusetts” when defendant would travel there to collect rent from Hodzic, and defendant also saw him at Hillside Drive when she would meet Hodzic there to collect rent. The defendant denied having any conversations with Belenkii.', 'In the course of the five-day trial, the state presented a number of witnesses; and, at the conclusion of the state‟s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. That motion was denied.', 'After presenting defendant and five witnesses, the defense rested, and defendant renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal. That motion again was denied; the trial justice indicated “that applying the correct test, * * * there is sufficient evidence so that both counts can go to the jury.”', 'The trial justice next turned to his instructions for the jury. Before delivering the charge, however, he discussed defendant‟s objection to an aiding and abetting instruction and invited argument on the issue. The defendant argued that the charging document did not reference G.L. 1956 § 11-1-3, which states that “[e]very person who shall aid, assist, abet * * * or procure another to commit any crime or offense, shall be proceeded against as principal or as an accessory before the fact, according to the nature of the offense committed * * *.” Moreover,', '-5- according to defendant, in cases where an aiding and abetting instruction was warranted, the accused was present at the scene of the crime. In addition, defendant argued that “constructive manufacturing or constructive cultivation” could not survive a motion for judgment of acquittal because the count charging cultivation of marijuana requires “the actual act itself.”', 'The defendant further argued that there should have been a conspiracy count or she should have been charged with “aiding and abetting as an accessory before the fact,” but instead, defendant “was only charged as a principal.”', 'The trial justice “totally disagree[d]” with defendant‟s argument. He quoted this Court‟s decision in State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005), in support of his conclusion that “§ 11-1-3 eliminates the legal distinction between the commission of a crime as a principal and aiding and abetting another in the commission of a crime, and for this reason, defendant‟s manner of participation, whether as a principal or an aider or abettor, is not an element of the crime.” Finally, the trial justice concluded that, under defendant‟s reasoning, “no one could be held culpable of the grow at issue because no one was present at the grow site on June 17, 2009. That can‟t be the law. I find that it‟s not the law.”4 4', 'The portion of the instructions pertinent to this Court‟s review of the case reads as follows:', '“I now turn to Count 2 which alleges manufacturing or cultivating', 'marijuana. In order for you to convict the defendant, you must find that the State', 'has proved the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: One, that on or', 'about the 17th day of June, 2009, the defendant manufactured or cultivated', 'marijuana; and two, that she did so unlawfully with knowledge and intent.

According to defendant, § 21-28-1.02 “requires action for one to be found culpable” and “there is no evidence that [defendant] produced, prepared, or cultivated the marijuana plants growing in the basement of 5 Hillside Drive.” (Emphasis added.) Further, defendant argues that the fact that she rented the property does not equate to “an inference that she actively or knowingly participated in the marijuana grow,” but rather that, at most, the evidence proved only that defendant was an accessory before the fact.', 'Rule 29(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he court * * * shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction * * *.” Viewing the evidence “in the light most favorable to the state” and “giving full credibility to the state‟s witnesses,” Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446 (quoting Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 148), we conclude that sufficient evidence existed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt defendant‟s participation in the “production, preparation, propagation, cultivation, compounding, or processing” of marijuana in accordance with § 21-28-1.02(27).', 'It is clear that Belenkii‟s testimony placed defendant at various meetings where the', '-9- operation and its profits were discussed; she participated in the planning and preparation for the grow operation at Hillside Drive; received money from Belenkii for rent and equipment; and managed the rent and utility payments while the operation was ongoing. In addition, defendant directed the unloading of materials and equipment at the property and had one of only two keys to the basement door. According to Belenkii, defendant spoke with him about the operation approximately every other day and was present when Belenkii and Hodzic arrived to inspect the grow; defendant was present during discussions of probable yield of the plants and the cloning process, and she indicated that she “wanted to get paid in marijuana rather than cash proceeds.” Although defendant argues that Belenkii‟s testimony was not credible, this Court does not pass upon the credibility of witnesses in determining whether a judgment of acquittal was warranted. See Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446 (this Court “giv[es] full credibility to the state‟s witnesses” when reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, quoting Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 148). Indeed, defendant‟s argument is misplaced; a challenge to the credibility of a witness properly is the subject of a motion for new trial, and none was made in this case.', 'The defendant also argues that “there [was] no evidence establishing [her] presence at the scene of the marijuana grow during the time period the marijuana was being cultivated.” We disagree.', 'The execution of the search warrant at 5 Hillside Drive provided evidence that demonstrated defendant‟s connection to the rented property. Specifically, the VIN numbers of three of the vehicles present on the property were traced back to defendant and her boyfriend; an employee identification tag and a passport—both in defendant‟s name—were seized from the house; photographs of defendant were found in the house; and utility bills with defendant‟s name on them also were seized.', 'Based on the foregoing, the trial justice did not err when he denied defendant‟s motion', '- 10 - for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of manufacturing and cultivating marijuana. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as is required under the standard for a motion for judgment of acquittal, we are of the opinion there was sufficient evidence to establish defendant‟s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the trial justice appropriately denied defendant‟s Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'The defendant‟s next argument is that the Superior Court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of aiding and abetting the manufacture and cultivation of marijuana. The defendant argues that the evidence was not sufficient to convict her of that offense. According to defendant, she should have been charged, if at all, as an accessory before the fact. Much like her first assignment of error, this argument is grounded in defendant‟s insistence that the evidence failed to place her at Hillside Drive when the marijuana grow operations were underway.', 'To prove criminal liability for aiding and abetting a criminal act, it must be shown that “(1) „the alleged aider and abettor share[d] in the criminal intent of the principal,‟ and (2) „a community of unlawful purpose‟ exist[ed] between them.” Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 131 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Curtin v. Lataille, 527 A.2d 1130, 1132 (R.I. 1987)). Having viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant‟s conviction and the trial justice therefore properly denied the motion for judgment of acquittal. We are satisfied that defendant‟s actions demonstrated a shared unlawful intent to manufacture or cultivate marijuana and, further, that a community of unlawful purpose existed between and among defendant, Belenkii, and Hodzic.', 'The defendant‟s final argument is that the trial justice erred when he instructed the jury that it could convict defendant of manufacturing or cultivating marijuana as an aider or abettor.', '- 11 - The defendant claims that the aiding and abetting instruction was improper because, again, she was not present at Hillside Drive and, moreover, the instruction confused the issues. We deem this argument to be without merit.', 'We are mindful that “[a]n erroneous charge warrants reversal only if it can be shown that the jury „could have been misled‟ to the resultant prejudice of the complaining party.” Sivo, 925 A.2d at 913 (quoting Saber, 811 A.2d at 653). Section 11-1-3 provides that a person who aids or abets “another to commit any crime or offense, shall be proceeded against as principal * * * and upon conviction shall suffer the like punishment as the principal offender is subject to by this title.” This Court has observed that, pursuant to § 11-1-3, the manner of participation is not an element of the crime. See Davis, 877 A.2d at 648 (“[Section] 11-1-3 eliminates the legal distinction between the commission of a crime as a principal and aiding and abetting another in the commission of a crime, and for this reason, [the] defendant‟s manner of participation, whether as a principal or an aider or abettor, is not an element of the crime.”). “The law is well settled „that one who aids and abets in the commission of the crime and is also present at the scene may be charged and convicted as a principal.‟” Id. (quoting State v. McMaugh, 512 A.2d 824, 831 (R.I. 1986)).', 'Here, Belenkii‟s testimony demonstrates that defendant was involved in the growing process both before and after the process commenced.', 'For example, Belenkii‟s testimony established that defendant was present at an initial planning meeting for the operation and, further, that she volunteered the suggestion that the well be fixed to insure a proper water supply. Belenkii also testified that defendant was present in the basement of Hillside Drive when he arrived to inspect the marijuana plants and that, once the cultivation was underway, he discussed the operation with defendant approximately every other day.', '- 12 -', 'Accordingly, we agree with the state that, “as long as a jury, having been properly instructed about the alternative theories of participation, is unanimously convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that * * * [the] defendant has participated in the crime as either an aider/abettor or as a direct principal, the jury is not required also unanimously to determine the manner of [the] defendant‟s participation.” Davis, 877 A.2d at 648.', 'Therefore, we are satisfied that Belenkii‟s testimony that defendant was at Hillside Drive on a number of occasions was sufficient to support the jury charge with respect to aiding and abetting.', 'Finally, we pause to acknowledge the defendant‟s argument that she was, at most, an accessory before the fact in this case. Significantly, defense counsel never argued that such a charge should be considered. Our “[c]ase law demonstrates that a trial justice need only instruct a jury on issues raised at trial.” State v. Medeiros, 599 A.2d 723, 727 (R.I. 1991). Therefore, we hold that the trial justice did not err in excluding an instruction on aiding and abetting as an accessory before the fact.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

78,"(03-4052) Robert E. Nichols : v. : R&D Construction Co., Inc. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. Robert E. Nichols, aggrieved by a decision and final decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court denying him partial incapacity benefits beyond the 312-week period provided by G.L. 1956 § 28-33-18.3, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. In that petition, he pointed to two issues as meriting resolution by this Court—viz.: (1) whether or not an employee who has received 312 weeks of benefits pursuant to the workers’ compensation statute may continue to receive those benefits as a result of the fact that he has failed to regain his former earning capacity; and (2) whether or not § 28- 33-18(d) is constitutional.', 'The petition for certiorari having been granted, this case came before the Court for oral argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decision and final decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 26, 1995, Mr. Nichols was injured as a result of a fall from a roof while he was working for R&D Construction Co., Inc. He suffered an injury to the L1 disc in his spine; and, shortly thereafter, he began receiving disability benefits. 1 Several years later, Mr. Nichols was notified that his partial disability benefits would be terminated on July 17, 2003. It is Mr. Nichols’s challenge to that termination of benefits that gave rise to this case.', 'A', 'The Proceedings Before the Workers’ Compensation Court', 'On February 5, 2002, more than six years after the date of his injury, Mr. Nichols filed in the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC) a petition (W.C.C. 02-854) requesting continuation of benefits pursuant to § 28-33-18.3 and/or a finding that he was totally disabled pursuant to § 28- 33-17(b)(2). Mr. Nichols later amended his petition to add a challenge to the constitutionality of § 28-33-18(d).', 'On March 20, 2002, a judge of the WCC denied the petition, and Mr. Nichols then requested a trial,2 which commenced on January 6, 2003. The trial was held on six different dates, with the final date being October 24, 2005. Over the course of the trial, the trial judge 1', 'A more complete history of the disability benefits received by Mr. Nichols is set forth in Section I A, infra. 2', 'Mr. Nichols also filed a second petition (W.C.C. 03-4052), which was consolidated with his original petition for trial before the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC). However, in Mr. Nichols’s petition for a writ of certiorari, he acknowledged that the issue raised in W.C.C. 03- 4052 has since been passed upon by this Court in Mumma v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 965 A.2d 437 (R.I. 2009); for that reason Mr. Nichols is no longer pressing that issue. Accordingly, the only issues now before this Court are those raised in W.C.C. 02-854.', '-2- heard testimony from Mr. Nichols, Diane Nichols (the wife of Mr. Nichols and president of R&D Construction), and Edmond Calandra (a vocational expert).', 'In addition to the live testimony, the parties submitted numerous documentary exhibits.', '1', 'The Trial Evidence', 'At trial, a number of documents were submitted to the trial judge as exhibits evidencing the history of disability benefits received by Mr. Nichols. Among those documents was a memorandum of agreement, dated January 18, 1996, which established that the injury to Mr. Nichols’s L1 disc on December 26, 1995 entitled him to total incapacity benefits as of December 27, 1995. A ―Mutual Agreement‖ that was signed on October 16, 1996 indicates that Mr. Nichols’s benefits were later modified from total to partial incapacity as of July 28, 1996. Pursuant to a suspension agreement and receipt signed on January 7, 1997, Mr. Nichols and R&D Construction agreed that weekly compensation benefits had ceased as of October 6, 1996. However, Mr. Nichols again became partially disabled; and the benefits associated with that disability are set forth in a second memorandum of agreement that was signed on May 23, 1997. The May 1997 memorandum of agreement indicates (1) that the previous total incapacity benefits had ended as of October 6, 1996 and (2) that Mr. Nichols was again entitled to temporary partial benefits as of January 13, 1997. Several years thereafter, Mr. Nichols was notified that his benefits would be terminated on July 17, 2003, 3 pursuant to the 312-week limit contained within § 28-33-18(d). 3', 'The employer sent notice to Mr. Nichols that his partial compensation benefits would be terminated, which notice prompted the filing of the petition in this case; but that original notice was sent approximately fourteen weeks earlier than required. Pursuant to an order of the WCC dated November 8, 2002, the employer was informed that the notice was invalid and the employer was directed to send an appropriate notice. The employer sent the appropriate notice', '-3-', 'At his trial in the WCC, Mr. Nichols testified that, at the time of the injury that gave rise to this case (December 26, 1995), he had been employed on a forty-hour-a-week basis as a ―working foreman‖ and vice president of R&D Construction, a family-run business of which his wife was president. He further testified that, in the months prior to his injury, R&D Construction had been engaged in doing renovations and additions and in constructing new homes and also in doing ―a lot of roofing.‖', 'Mr. Nichols then proceeded to testify that, on December 26, 1995, he fell from a roof and landed in a parking lot. He further stated that the fall resulted in a fracture in his ―low back‖ and that he was ―out of work completely‖ from the date of the fall until July of 1996. At the time of his injury, he was earning $848.34 a week. Mr. Nichols testified that, after he resumed work in July of 1996, he returned to the ―same position‖ at the company; but he added that his responsibilities were different. For example, he testified that he could not ―do roofing‖ or ―any heavy lifting,‖ and he added that shoveling was a problem for him. He stated that, if he attempted doing the physical labor that he had performed prior to his injury, he ―end[ed] up having to leave early.‖', 'When Mr. Nichols was asked by counsel if there were any ―arrangements‖ with the company that were available to him on days when he had back problems, he replied that he could leave the job site.', 'He testified that he did not need ―clearance‖ to leave for that reason, but he added that he usually called his wife to tell her that he was leaving.', 'Mr. Nichols testified that he worked as a Santa Claus for four to six weeks every December, beginning in approximately 2000. However, Mr. Nichols further testified that he had not pursued other employment or sought retraining. on January 17, 2003, indicating that Mr. Nichols’s benefits would terminate twenty-six weeks from that date—i.e., on July 17, 2003.', '-4-', 'Mr. Edmond Calandra, a vocational consultant, also testified at the trial in the WCC. It was Mr. Calandra’s testimony that, in his opinion, Mr. Nichols’s partial incapacity posed a ―material hindrance‖4 to his obtaining employment suitable to his limitations. Mr. Calandra based that opinion on what he characterized as Mr. Nichols’s ―employment arrangement‖ with his wife’s company, which he said ―really accommodate[d] his physical restrictions in a way that a structured employment environment, specifically in the construction trade, would not allow for.‖', 'On cross-examination, Mr. Calandra testified that he had reviewed documentation from Mr. Nichols’s physicians, which indicated that Mr. Nichols had physical limitations. It also became apparent through Mr. Calandra’s testimony that he had in his possession at trial only his report on Mr. Nichols; he testified that all of the materials that he had reviewed for the case had been destroyed or discarded.', 'B', 'The Trial Judge’s Decision', 'The trial judge’s decision was entered on December 21, 2005. Although it is clear from the decision that Mr. Nichols had raised four issues at the nisi prius stage, only two of those issues are relevant to this appeal—namely, (1) whether Mr. Nichols’s incapacity poses a ―material hindrance‖ to obtaining employment suitable to his limitations;5 and (2) whether § 28- 33-18 is unconstitutional. The trial judge ultimately found that Mr. Nichols had failed to prove 4', 'The term ―material hindrance‖ appears in G.L. 1956 § 28-33-18.3(a)(1)—a statute that we address in Section III A, infra. 5', 'In actuality, the trial judge dealt first with the argument concerning the statute’s alleged unconstitutionality and then turned to the ―material hindrance‖ argument. However, in this opinion we shall first address the ―material hindrance‖ issue; then, after our discussion of that purely statutory issue is complete, we shall turn to the constitutionality issue.', '-5- that he has a ―material hindrance‖ to obtaining suitable employment or that § 28-33-18 is unconstitutional. The trial judge concluded her decision by ordering that the petition be denied and dismissed.', 'The trial judge quite unequivocally rejected Mr. Nichols’s ―material hindrance‖ argument. She stated that Mr. Nichols’s ―work history, wage records and medical reports do not support his material hindrance argument.‖ She explained that Mr. Nichols ―ha[d] worked fairly consistently‖ since August of 1996, and she noted that ―his wage records indicate[d] a general increase in wages earned since returning to work following his injury.‖ Additionally, she observed that Mr. Nichols had not sought other employment (aside from his seasonal work as a Santa Claus), nor had he sought retraining. The trial judge relied on the medical reports from two of Mr. Nichols’s physicians, which indicated that Mr. Nichols was doing well and that his back symptoms were stable. Notably, the trial judge rejected the opinion of the vocational expert, Mr. Calandra, with respect to the ―material hindrance‖ issue. She based that rejection on a number of factors—including the fact that Mr. Calandra had not been provided with some of the medical records prepared by Mr. Nichols’s physicians and therefore could not take them into account. The trial judge also noted that the vocational expert, when asked by the court to provide his file, could not provide the file or any supporting documentation other than his final report on Mr. Nichols. Additionally, the trial judge explained that Mr. Nichols had not attempted to find other employment nor had he sought retraining; she also noted that he had ―a relatively small whole person impairment rating.‖ For these reasons, the trial judge found that Mr. Nichols had failed to establish that his disability posed a ―material hindrance‖ to obtaining suitable employment.', '-6-', 'The trial judge also dispatched of Mr. Nichols’s constitutional challenge to § 28-33-18, noting that the Appellate Division of the WCC had previously addressed such a constitutional argument in McQuaide v. Westerly Health Center, W.C.C. 99-3252 (App. Div. 2000).6 The trial judge noted that, in McQuaide, the Appellate Division had determined that ―similarly situated employees were treated similarly and that there was a rational basis for the legislation.‖', 'C', 'The Appellate Division’s Decision', 'Mr. Nichols thereafter claimed an appeal of the trial judge’s decision to the Appellate Division of the WCC. The parties were ordered to appear before the Appellate Division on May 17, 2006 for oral argument;7 and, on August 25, 2010, the Appellate Division filed a written decision affirming the decision of the trial judge. The Appellate Division’s decision was entered on September 1, 2010.', 'The Appellate Division summarily dismissed Mr. Nichols’s statutorily-based contention—viz., that his partial incapacity constituted a ―material hindrance‖ to obtaining suitable employment.', 'See § 28-33-18.', 'The Appellate Division ruled that Mr. Nichols’s statements on appeal to that body ―lack[ed] the specificity required by [G.L. 1956 § 28-35- 28(a)]‖ and that, therefore, Mr. Nichols’s statutory argument did ―not warrant consideration by the panel.‖ 6', 'The remainder of the trial judge’s decision addresses Mr. Nichols’s other arguments raised at trial, none of which are at issue in this appeal. 7', 'Although the docket sheet attached to the WCC file contains an entry on May 17, 2006 with the description ―ORAL ARGUMENT HEARD,‖ no transcript of oral arguments before the Appellate Division has been filed with this Court; and any arguments that may have occurred on that date are not referenced in the Appellate Division’s decision.', '-7-', 'Even though the Appellate Division ruled that Mr. Nichols’s ―material hindrance‖ argument had not been presented in a procedurally proper manner, it nevertheless proceeded to address the merits of that argument, which the Appellate Division ultimately found to be unconvincing. The Appellate Division stated as follows:', '―[Section 28-33-18.3] makes no reference to the inability to regain', 'one’s earning capacity as the standard to qualify for continued', 'benefits beyond 312 weeks.

In this case, Mr. Nichols remained employed in a position which accommodated his limitations, and thus he did not meet his burden of proving that his incapacity posed a material hindrance to obtaining employment. Therefore, we hold that the Appellate Division did not err in affirming the trial judge’s decision on the ―material hindrance‖ issue.', 'B', 'Constitutionality of § 28-33-18(d)', 'Mr. Nichols contends that § 28-33-18(d) violates the equal protection clause of the Rhode Island Constitution, article 1, section 2.

Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, 941 A.2d 198, 211 (R.I. 2008) (―It is well settled that under the equal protection clause, legislative classifications that do not affect a fundamental right or a suspect class such as race, alienage, or national origin, are examined under a minimal-scrutiny analysis.‖ (internal quotation marks omitted)).', 'Under the rational basis test, we ―merely determine[ ] whether the differential treatment bears a reasonable or rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.‖ Boucher v.

However, ―the proper inquiry is not whether this Court can find a rational basis for the statute, but whether the General Assembly rationally could conclude that the legislation would solve a legitimate problem.‖ Faria, 947 A.2d at 868 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'After reviewing this Court’s precedent in the equal protection domain and after considering the written and oral arguments of counsel, we see no reason to disturb the conclusions of the Appellate Division on this issue. Nor are we at all convinced that there is no rational basis for limiting the potentially infinite and burdensome duration of partial incapacity benefits. See, e.g., Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 314 (1976) (―This [rational basis] inquiry employs a relatively relaxed standard reflecting the Court’s awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one. Perfection in making the necessary classifications is neither possible nor necessary.‖).

79,State : v. : Jason Lopes.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, Jason Lopes (Lopes or defendant), appeals from a judgment of conviction in Superior Court declaring him to be in violation of his probation and executing six years of his previously imposed sentence. On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of this judgment. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on February 6, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 27, 2002, Lopes pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a crime of violence (count 1), carrying a pistol without a license (count 2), reckless driving (count 3), and driving with a suspended license (count 4). On count 1, he received a sentence of ten years, with four years to serve and six years suspended, and six years probation. On count 2, he received a sentence of ten years, with four years to serve and six years suspended,', '-1- and six years probation. On counts 3 and 4, he received a one-year sentence. All sentences were to run concurrently.', 'On May 4, 2009, Lopes was presented as a violator of the terms and conditions of his probation under Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, based on an allegation of domestic simple assault occurring on May 1, 2009.', 'The state subsequently withdrew that violation notice.', 'On May 19, 2009, the state filed a second violation notice under Rule 32(f), this time alleging that, on May 1, 2009, Lopes violated the terms and conditions of his probation by possessing a firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime of violence. 1 On June 15, 2010, Lopes was adjudged to be in violation of his probation by a justice of the Superior Court. The events underlying that adjudication are now before us on appeal. Below, we summarize the relevant testimony from that hearing.', 'Providence Police Officer Louis Salinaro (Officer Salinaro) testified that, at approximately 7:30 a.m. on May 1, 2009, Latoya German contacted the Providence police alleging that her sister, Nichelle German, had sent her a text message, in which she wrote that she had just been assaulted by Lopes, Nichelle’s boyfriend. 2 (Both Latoya and Nichelle were subpoenaed by the state to testify at the violation hearing, but they failed to appear.) In that phone call to police, Latoya also stated that Lopes “was known to carry weapons in the past.” Officer Salinaro testified that, shortly thereafter, he responded to Nichelle’s second-floor apartment located at 199 Laurel Hill Avenue. He further testified that, prior to arriving at this 1', 'The state also filed a new charge against Lopes for this conduct under G.L. 1956 § 11-47-5. Following the lower court’s determination that Lopes had indeed violated the terms and conditions of his probation, the state later dismissed this charge under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2', 'This Court means no disrespect by referring to some individuals in this opinion by their first names. It is for clarity purposes only that first names are used.', '-2- apartment, dispatch informed him and another responding officer, Francis Furtado (Officer Furtado), that Lopes had prior firearm convictions.', 'Officer Salinaro was the first to arrive at the apartment. When he got there, Nichelle answered the back door. He testified that she “was very nervous,” “afraid,” and “had a swollen [right] cheek,” which he described as a “fresh” injury. She told Officer Salinaro that Lopes had assaulted her when she arrived home the previous night. Officer Furtado was not present for this conversation; he testified that he entered the apartment about ten to twenty seconds after Officer Salinaro.', 'Upon noticing Nichelle’s small child in the kitchen, Officer Salinaro testified that he asked Nichelle “if it was okay for [Officer Furtado and him] to check the apartment to make sure that her [sic] and the baby were all set,” to which she obliged. When asked whether anyone else was in the apartment, she responded that her boyfriend had just left.', 'Officer Salinaro testified that he saw Lopes exit the front bedroom soon thereafter. Nichelle explained that Lopes was her boyfriend. He testified that Nichelle “was acting very afraid” while Lopes “just kept staring at her.” She remained “very, very nervous, very fidgety, looking all around the room.”', 'Officer Furtado testified that he then asked Nichelle, in the presence of Lopes, what had happened to her injured face. Nichelle responded that “she fell.” Officer Furtado further recalled that Lopes also interjected, stating that “[Nichelle] fell last night when she was out with friends.” 3 However, Officer Furtado further testified that later, in the privacy of the kitchen, he again asked Nichelle “what really occurred.” In response she told him that she and Lopes had 3', 'However, we note that Officer Salinaro testified differently. He stated that Lopes did not say anything to the officers regarding the circumstances surrounding Nichelle’s injury.', '-3- argued the previous night, Lopes called her a “f***in’ b****,” and that, when she finally went to bed, Lopes then punched her in the face. 4', 'Officer Furtado then ran Lopes’s name through the National Criminal Identification Center, which revealed that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest related to his failure to appear for operating a vehicle with an expired license. Another Providence police officer then executed the outstanding arrest warrant and escorted him outside. While Lopes was being escorted out of the apartment, Officer Furtado asked him whether there were any firearms present in the home. Lopes responded that “he used to do that in the past and [that] he no longer does those sort of things.”', 'Officers Salinaro and Furtado both testified that they then obtained Nichelle’s permission to search her apartment for firearms. 5 They first entered the bedroom—the same room from which Lopes had initially emerged. On top of a six-foot-tall cabinet in that room, Officer Salinaro observed what appeared to be the handle of a gun “sticking out of the right boot” of a pair of brown men’s work boots. Officer Salinaro stated that the cabinet also contained a dark colored T-shirt, and “a couple of duffle bags.” He testified that he removed the boot and determined that it indeed contained a gun. He then replaced the boot and gun on top of the cabinet. 6', 'Officer Furtado testified that, after discovering the gun, he called for BCI detectives to respond. Detective Douglas Allen (Det. Allen), a BCI detective for the Providence police, 4', 'As noted above, the state withdrew its violation notice with respect to the charge of domestic simple assault. Although the hearing justice allowed the officers to testify regarding Nichelle’s statements concerning alleged domestic abuse, he did not consider that testimony in declaring Lopes to be a violator of the terms and conditions of his probation. 5', 'On cross-examination, Officers Salinaro and Furtado both admitted that, when they drafted their witness statements, neither mentioned obtaining Nichelle’s consent to search. 6', 'On cross-examination, Officer Salinaro admitted that, when he replaced the boot and gun on top of the cabinet, the gun then fell inside the boot.', '-4- testified that he reported to Nichelle’s home at approximately 8 a.m. on May 1, 2009. When he arrived, he first photographed the work boots and the gun; he then seized the gun. 7 He identified the gun as a semi-automatic nine-millimeter pistol with a magazine, and he noted that the safety was disengaged. After test-firing the gun, he determined that it was a functioning firearm, which contained nine rounds in the magazine. Detective Allen further testified that there were “no usable fingerprints found” on the firearm. The state then rested.', 'Lopes rested following the state’s presentation of evidence. In his argument below, Lopes averred that the state failed to meet its burden of proof in establishing that he was in possession of the firearm in question. All that the state produced, Lopes contended, was that he exited the same bedroom in which the firearm was found. In Lopes’s view, the state did not establish any nexus between him and the firearm. Countering this argument, the state argued that the evidence was sufficient for the court to infer that Lopes had “dominion and control” over the firearm, because it was found in a men’s work boot, which was located in the bedroom from which he had exited. Additionally, according to the state, since the safety of the firearm was not engaged, this further proved that Lopes’s behavior fell short of keeping the peace and being of good behavior.', 'The hearing justice then rendered a bench decision, acknowledging that, while there was inconsistent testimony as to the exact location of the boot and the firearm when Det. Allen arrived, this inconsistency “[did not] belie the fact that there was a gun, and it was in the proximity of the bedroom, and the defendant came out of the bedroom.” He further elaborated that Lopes, who was on probation for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence, had “no business being anywhere near a loaded gun or an unloaded gun.” 7', 'According to Det. Allen, when he arrived at the apartment, the boot and gun were located on the kitchen table.', '-5- Considering the totality of the evidence before him, the hearing justice drew a “reasonable inference” that Lopes knew the firearm was in the bedroom and that he had dominion and control over it.', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice declared Lopes to be in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation and executed six years of his previously imposed sentence. On June 21, 2010, Lopes filed a notice of appeal to this Court. 8', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'On appeal, Lopes contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the hearing justice’s finding that he failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior. He characterizes this finding as both “arbitrar[y] and capricious[ ].” Specifically, Lopes challenges the hearing justice’s determination that he was ever in possession of the firearm at issue. According to Lopes, “[t]he most the hearing justice could have reasonably found * * * was [his] mere presence in a place where the [firearm] was discovered.”', 'In countering Lopes’s argument on appeal, the state maintains that the hearing justice did not rule in an arbitrary or capricious manner in finding that Lopes violated the terms and conditions of his probation. The state points out that Lopes lied to Officer Furtado twice: first, when he stated that Nichelle’s injury was caused by a fall, and second, when he told the officers that there were no firearms present in the house. There was no evidence that any person other than Nichelle and her small child inhabited the house. Therefore, the state argues that it was reasonable for the hearing justice to infer that the firearm belonged to Lopes. Accordingly, the 8', 'Although judgment did not enter until December 16, 2011, we nonetheless treat his appeal as timely. See Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011).', '-6- state maintains that the hearing justice was justified in finding that Lopes failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior, thereby violating the terms and conditions of his probation.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'The sole issue for the hearing justice to consider at a probation-violation hearing is “whether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v. Washington, 42 A.3d 1265, 1271 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Christodal, 946 A.2d 811, 816 (R.I. 2008)). While the burden of proof at a criminal trial requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime charged, the burden of proof at a probation-violation hearing is significantly lower. State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 310 (R.I. 2008). The “state need only show that ‘reasonably satisfactory’ evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.” Id. (quoting State v. Forbes, 925 A.2d 929, 934 (R.I. 2007)).', 'Further, “[i]n determining whether or not a defendant has committed a probation violation, the hearing justice is charged with weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Delarosa, 39 A.3d 1043, 1049-50 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Pona, 13 A.3d 642, 647 (R.I. 2011)). We limit our review of a finding of a probation violation “to determining ‘whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in assessing the credibility of the witnesses or in finding such a violation.’” Washington, 42 A.3d at 1271 (quoting State v. Tetreault, 973 A.2d 489, 492 (R.I. 2009)). “It is not the role of the hearing justice to determine the validity of the specific charge that formed the basis of the violation.” State v. Gautier, 774 A.2d 882, 887 (R.I. 2001). Indeed, we emphasize that the merits of any', '-7- new charges are not before us on review of an adjudication of a probation violation. See State v. Brown, 915 A.2d 1279, 1282 (R.I. 2007).', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'At the outset, we note that Lopes has directed our attention toward the wrong issue. Lopes urges this Court to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to show that he was in possession of the firearm in question. However, the sufficiency of the evidence against Lopes on the charge of possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime of violence is not the focus of our review, nor was it the focus at the hearing below. Instead, “the sole purpose of a probation-revocation proceeding is for the trial justice to determine whether [the terms and conditions of probation] have been violated.” Pona, 13 A.3d at 648 (quoting State v. Sylvia, 871 A.2d 954, 957 (R.I. 2005)).', 'Here, the state did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt (or to any other degree) that Lopes committed the crime of possession of a firearm; instead, “the state need only [have] reasonably satisf[ied] the hearing justice that [Lopes] breached a condition of probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” Pona, 13 A.3d at 648 (quoting State v. Jones, 969 A.2d 676, 680 (R.I. 2009)). Therefore, the hearing justice correctly did not consider whether Lopes was actually guilty of the crime of possession of a firearm. See id.', 'The hearing justice was charged with weighing the credibility of the witnesses who testified at the probation-violation hearing. Pona, 13 A.3d at 647. We believe that the hearing justice aptly fulfilled that obligation. As articulated in his findings, he concluded that the testimony provided by Officers Salinaro and Furtado was “reasonably credible.” He found that, while there was some inconsistency in the testimony concerning the exact placement of the', '-8- firearm after it was discovered by the officers, this discrepancy did not change the fact that a firearm was found in the very bedroom from which Lopes had exited that same morning. Both Officers Salinaro and Furtado, the hearing justice explained, were veterans in the patrol division. He therefore concluded that their testimony, in which they stated that they replaced the firearm inside the work boot on top of the bedroom cabinet, was more reliable than that of the “minimal[ly] involve[d]” Det. Allen, who stated that the firearm was on the kitchen table when he arrived. We cannot disagree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that, based on “all of the facts and circumstances,” the “reasonable inference” is that Lopes was “in the bedroom with the gun[,] * * * he knew it was there, * * * [h]e was consciously aware of it, [and] [h]e had dominion and control over it.” This Court is therefore satisfied that Lopes failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior; and, accordingly, we agree with the hearing justice that Lopes violated the terms and conditions of his probation.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

Yet again, we are called upon to resolve a dispute stemming from the consequences of public corruption. In this appeal, the Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island (defendant or board) asks us to decide whether the trial justice erred in finding that it could not refuse a demand for reimbursement of retirement contributions to John A. Zambarano (plaintiff or Zambarano). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on February 6, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 19, 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Zambarano on eight felony counts relating to his unethical conduct as a member of the North Providence Town Council. 1 Zambarano pled guilty to all counts on March 1, 2011, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on May 17, 2011. On the day of his sentencing, an order of forfeiture entered in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island which required Zambarano to forfeit $46,000 to the federal government. According to the board, this order, which was also entered as a money judgment against Zambarano, “represents the amount of bribe money which [he] and his co-defendants received in exchange for agreeing to perform official acts as [members] of the North Providence Town Council.” Zambarano was also ordered to pay a special assessment of $800 and a fine of $10,000.', 'On February 4, 2011, about one month before Zambarano pled to the charges, he resigned from his position at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC). He had been employed as a janitorial/maintenance supervisor at the DOC for approximately eight years and nine months, during which time he contributed $30,554.20 to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI). Over his approximately thirteen years and two months as a member of the North Providence Town Council, he had also contributed $5,490.50 to the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System (MERS). Both ERSRI and MERS are administered by the board. See G.L. 1956 § 36-8-4. 1', 'In a separate indictment, Zambarano was also charged with other crimes which did not relate to his conduct as a member of the town council. Those charges are not at issue in this appeal.', '-2-', 'On the day he resigned from his position at the DOC, Zambarano sent a letter to the DOC requesting a refund of his contributions to ERSRI. In a letter dated April 18, 2011, the board responded to Zambarano’s demand as follows:', '“In light of your plea agreement and the potential monetary', 'judgments to be entered against you, pursuant to the Rhode Island', 'Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act, [G.L.', '1956 chapter 10.1 of title 36,] it is our opinion that you are not', 'entitled to a return of contributions. Consequently, at this time we', 'cannot process your request.”', 'Soon after, on April 25, 2011, Zambarano filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and monetary damages against the board. 2 He alleged that G.L. 1956 § 36-10-8 entitled him to a refund of the contributions he had made to ERSRI. 3 In a motion filed on April 27, 2011, Zambarano contended that the board’s refusal to return those contributions amounted to conversion and breach of its fiduciary duty. He cited G.L. 1956 § 36- 10.1-4(c) in support of his argument that the board was obligated to return his contributions to him. Section 36-10.1-4(c) provides as follows:', '“[N]o payments in return of contributions shall be made or ordered', 'unless and until the [S]uperior [C]ourt determines that the public', 'official or public employee whose retirement or other benefits or', 'payments have been revoked or reduced under this chapter has', 'satisfied in full any judgments or orders rendered by any court of', 'competent jurisdiction for the payment of restitution for losses', 'incurred by any person as a result of the subject crime related to', 'public office or public employment.” 2', 'Zambarano named the fifteen individuals who serve on the board as defendants (in their official capacities). 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 36-10-8 provides that “[a] member [of ERSRI] who withdraws from service * * * shall be paid on demand a refund consisting of the accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in his or her individual account in the annuity savings account, without interest.”', '-3- Because the order to be entered against him in federal court would be an order of forfeiture, not an order of restitution, Zambarano asserted that the board had no basis for refusing to return his contributions.', 'In an answer filed on May 31, 2011—after the order of forfeiture had entered against Zambarano—the board denied the substantive allegations of the complaint, raised several affirmative defenses, and asserted counterclaims against Zambarano.', 'On June 22, 2011, Zambarano moved to amend his complaint. Among other things, he sought to add an “innocent spouse” claim by his wife, Kathy A. Zambarano, who was also named as a plaintiff. 4 The board assented to the filing of Zambarano’s amended complaint and filed its amended answer on June 29, 2011.', 'A bench trial was held before a justice of the Superior Court on September 15, 2011. The parties submitted a stipulated set of facts before the trial began. Two witnesses testified: Kathy Zambarano and Frank Karpinski, the executive director of ERSRI. Because the board has not appealed that portion of the judgment relating to Kathy Zambarano’s “innocent spouse” claim, we will not summarize her testimony.', 'Karpinski’s testimony confirmed certain facts regarding Zambarano’s length of municipal and state service and his eligibility for pensions from MERS and ERSRI. Karpinski testified that Zambarano would be entitled to a municipal pension benefit once he reached the age of fifty-eight. This pension benefit would be about $175.55 per month, or about $154.45 per 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 36-10.1-3(d) provides as follows:', '“If the [S]uperior [C]ourt determines that the retirement or other benefits', 'or payments of a public official or public employee should be revoked or reduced', 'under this chapter, it may, in its discretion and after taking into consideration the', 'financial needs and resources of any innocent spouse * * * order that some or all', 'of the revoked or reduced benefits or payments be paid to [that] innocent spouse *', '* * as justice may require.”', '-4- month if Zambarano’s period of dishonorable service was excluded from the calculation. Karpinski stated that Zambarano’s municipal pension benefit could not be paid to another individual before Zambarano attained the age of fifty-eight.', 'Karpinski also testified that Zambarano was not entitled to a pension benefit for his service as a state employee because he had been a state employee for less than ten years when he resigned from his position at the DOC.', 'On December 13, 2011, after the parties presented arguments, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. 5 Pursuant to § 36-10.1-3, the trial justice revoked Zambarano’s MERS pension in its entirety, citing “the seriousness of the offense[s]” and Zambarano’s “grievous breach of public trust.” The trial justice also ordered the board to return to Zambarano the contributions he had made to ERSRI when he worked for the DOC. Interpreting § 36-10.1-4(c), he found that the phrase “judgments or orders” was modified by the phrase “for the payment of restitution.” A contrary reading, he explained, “would lead to an absurd result.” Based on the plain language of the statute, the trial justice inferred that the law was intended to reach “situation[s] where someone was injured, either economically or physically[,] by reason of conduct that occurred in the course of public employment.” He noted that “[i]f the General Assembly wanted [the statute] to apply * * * to any money owed for any purpose to anyone else, then they could have said that.”', 'The trial justice also found that Kathy Zambarano was “truly an innocent spouse within the meaning of [§ 36-10.1-3(d)].” Accordingly, he awarded Kathy the MERS pension to which her husband would have been entitled, excluding the period of Zambarano’s dishonorable service. Finally, the trial justice ordered the board to return to Zambarano the contributions he 5', 'Although the record indicates that the parties submitted post-trial memoranda, the record does not include copies of those documents.', '-5- had made to MERS during the period of his dishonorable service; these contributions totaled $720.', 'Judgment entered on January 3, 2012. The board timely appealed the Superior Court’s decision. It also moved, under Rule 62 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, for a stay of the judgment pending appeal. The Superior Court granted that motion in an order entered on January 31, 2012.', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The parties’ dispute centers on the application of § 36-10.1-4(c) to the facts of this case. Zambarano acknowledges that he is obliged to forfeit $46,000 to the federal government, but argues that he is nonetheless entitled to a return of his contributions to ERSRI and MERS. He maintains that, because no “judgments or orders * * * for the payment of restitution” have been entered against him, § 36-10.1-4(c) provides no basis upon which the board may refuse his request for a return of his contributions.', 'The board offers a different reading of § 36-10.1-4(c). It contends that the phrase “for the payment of restitution” modifies the word “orders” but does not modify the word “judgments.” Under this interpretation, the board argues that it may withhold Zambarano’s contributions until the federal court’s order of forfeiture has been satisfied in full.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'This appeal presents us with a singular issue of statutory interpretation.

Because Zambarano had not yet accumulated sufficient years in state service to be eligible for a state pension, the trial justice did not revoke (and could not have revoked) a', '-7- pension based on this employment. Thus, this provision of PEPRRA may not apply to the $30,554.20 in contributions that Zambarano made to ERSRI. It is unclear to us whether the General Assembly intended § 36-10.1-4 to apply in all situations where the Superior Court has revoked a pension of an ex-employee, whether or not that individual has made contributions toward another pension that may not yet have vested. However, because the parties do not contest that § 36-10.1-4 applies to Zambarano’s contributions to both MERS and ERSRI, we assume (without deciding) that it does, and proceed to consider whether the trial justice erred in interpreting the statute as applied to the facts of this case. 6', 'As noted above, § 36-10.1-4(c) provides that “no payments in return of contributions shall be made or ordered unless and until * * * the public official or public employee * * * has satisfied in full” certain “judgments or orders.” The disjunctive phrase “judgments or orders” is followed by four modifying phrases: (1) “rendered by any court of competent jurisdiction;” (2) “for the payment of restitution;” (3) “for losses incurred by any person;” and (4) “as a result of the subject crime related to public office or public employment.” Id. After reading § 36-10.1- 4(c) in its entirety, alongside PEPRRA’s other provisions, we conclude that all four of these phrases modify the phrase “judgments or orders.”', 'We have previously observed that “[b]ecause the language of the statute is clear, PEPRRA must be applied literally.” Smith v.

If the phrase “for the payment of restitution” is read to modify only the word “orders” and not the word “judgments,” then the 6', 'Even if we were to decide that § 36-10.1-4 does not apply to Zambarano’s contributions to ERSRI, we would affirm the trial justice’s decision on alternate grounds. Section 36-10-8 states, in pertinent part, that “[a] member [of ERSRI] who withdraws from service or ceases to be a member for any reason other than death or retirement shall be paid on demand a refund [of his or her retirement contributions].” Under this statute, Zambarano was entitled to a return of his contributions to ERSRI.', '-8- three other modifying phrases quoted above must also be read in like manner. The word “judgments” would thus be unmodified, but the word “orders” would be modified by four phrases. The General Assembly could not have intended such a result. The board concedes that the phrase “as a result of the subject crime related to public office or public employment” modifies both “judgments” and “orders,” but argues that “for the payment of restitution” modifies only the word “orders.” Because this reading results in an illogical interpretation of the statute, we must reject it. 7', 'The board argues that Zambarano’s reading of § 36-10.1-4(c) “would render the word ‘judgment[s]’ mere redundant surplusage * * *.” We disagree. To us, the disjunctive phrase “judgments or orders” shows that the Legislature intended the provision to apply in the event that an order of restitution was not later entered as a judgment of restitution. The word “judgments” is not surplusage; rather, it is an alternative means by which restitution can be required.', 'To bolster its argument, the board also directs our attention to § 36-10.1-3(a), which states that “any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind * * * shall be revoked or reduced” under certain circumstances. It contends that the phrase “of any kind” supports its reading of § 36-10.1-4(c). Because §§ 36-10.1-3 and 36-10.1-4(c) deal with two different subjects, this argument is unavailing. Section 36-10.1-3 authorizes the revocation or reduction of the pension or other benefits of a public official or employee. Its broad scope is evidence of the 7', 'In its papers to the Superior Court and to this Court, the board has repeatedly omitted the phrase “for the payment of restitution” when paraphrasing the language of § 36-10.1-4(c). This underscores our conclusion that the statute cannot be read as written according to the board’s interpretation. Contrary to its argument, the Superior Court is not “fully empowered to determine whether or not Mr. Zambarano has satisfied in full any judgments or orders related to his criminal conduct * * *.” (Emphasis added.) As we have explained above, § 36-10.1-4(c) sets forth specific limitations on the kinds of judgments or orders that must be satisfied before payments in return of contributions are made or ordered.', '-9- Legislature’s intent that those who betray the public trust receive no benefits whatsoever from the public fisc upon their separation from state or municipal employment. Section 36-10.1-4 applies not to pension benefits, but to the contributions made by the ex-employee. Under the plain language of § 36-10.1-4(c), the Superior Court may only consider whether certain specified kinds of judgments or orders for the payment of restitution have been satisfied before ordering the return of contributions to an ex-employee.', 'We decline to treat the order of forfeiture to which Zambarano is subject as an order of restitution. In so doing, we must briefly define and distinguish the concepts of restitution and forfeiture. “The word restitution means restoration. Restitution is a return or restoration of what the defendant has gained in a transaction.” 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 4.1(1) at 551 (2d ed. 1993). “Liability in restitution derives from the receipt of a benefit whose retention without payment would result in the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the claimant.” Restatement (Third) Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 1 cmt. a. at 3 (2011). Once liability is established, “the defendant must restore the benefit in question or its traceable product, or else pay money in the amount necessary to eliminate unjust enrichment.” Id.', 'Forfeiture is defined as “[t]he divestiture of property without compensation” or “[t]he loss of * * * property because of a crime, breach of obligation, or neglect of duty.” Black’s Law Dictionary 722 (9th ed. 2009). The federal government is authorized “to seek forfeiture of the proceeds of virtually all serious federal crimes * * *.” Jimmy Gurulé et al., The Law of Asset Forfeiture § 5-3(b). at 193 n.59 (2d ed. 2004). A forfeiture that is sought against a defendant in a criminal prosecution is punitive in nature, not remedial. See United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 332 (1998).', '- 10 -', 'A key distinction between restitution and forfeiture is the recipient of payments made to satisfy those orders. Payments made to satisfy orders of restitution are made to the individual at whose expense the defendant was unjustly enriched. By contrast, payments made to satisfy orders of forfeiture are made to the sovereign that sought the forfeiture—either the state or federal government. Here, the federal court did not order Zambarano to restore the $46,000 that he and his codefendants had accepted as bribe money to the individuals who had themselves broken the law by bribing public officials; instead, it ordered Zambarano to forfeit his ill-gotten gains to the federal government as part of the punishment it imposed for his crimes.', 'As Zambarano observed in his brief to this Court, “[s]imply stated, forfeiture is not restitution.” We cannot ignore the plain language of § 36-10.1-4(c); similarly, we cannot transmute the order of forfeiture into an order or judgment of restitution. Having concluded that the trial justice correctly found that “for the payment of restitution” modifies both “judgments” and “orders,” we hold that, because the federal court issued neither a judgment nor an order of restitution against Zambarano, § 36-10.1-4(c) provides the board no basis upon which it can refuse his demand for a return of his contributions. 8', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case. 8', 'Although the outcome of this appeal may appear unseemly to some observers, the fact that Zambarano is entitled to a return of his contributions does not change the reality that he remains liable on the federal court’s $46,000 forfeiture judgment against him.', '- 11 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'John A.

The applicant, Joseph Hall (Hall), appeals from a judgment that denied his application for postconviction relief. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts underlying Hall‟s conviction are set forth in detail in State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645, 649-52 (R.I. 2008). We recount only those facts relevant to the issues raised in Hall‟s application. In June 2006, Hall was tried in Superior Court for unlawfully carrying a pistol without a license; possession of a firearm after a conviction of a crime of violence; discharging a firearm within city limits; eluding a police officer; and resisting arrest. The state called Agent Edward Troiano (Agent Troiano), an Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent. When questioned about the statement Agent Troiano obtained from Hall on the night Hall was arrested,', '-1- Agent Troiano indicated—over Hall‟s objection—that he did not believe Hall‟s statement was “accurate and honest.” Faced with this testimony, the trial justice offered to give a curative instruction to the jury to disregard the testimony or, in the alternative, to consider a mistrial. After defense counsel was instructed to discuss these alternatives with Hall, Hall opted for a cautionary instruction and one was given, to which there was no objection.', 'The jury found Hall guilty on all counts. On direct appeal, Hall challenged an out-of- court identification, the competency of an eyewitness, aspects of the Habitual Offender Act, and the alleged involuntariness of his recorded statements. We affirmed the conviction. Hall, 940 A.2d at 660.', 'On November 19, 2008, Hall filed an application for postconviction relief, claiming that he was denied a fair and impartial trial because the jury was improperly instructed. Further, Hall claimed that the trial justice erred when he permitted Agent Troiano to “offer to the jury an opinion on the truthfulness of a statement that [Hall] made.”', 'Hall‟s court-appointed counsel filed a “no-merit memorandum” and a motion to withdraw, in accordance with Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000).1 The memorandum suggested that one claim might conceivably have merit:', 'the claim that the trial justice 1', '“In Shatney, we established a procedure by which an attorney * * * who has been appointed to represent an applicant for postconviction relief may later seek to withdraw from that representation under specific and limited circumstances[.]” Campbell v.

Even so, counsel reasoned that Hall‟s “rights were promptly protected by his defense attorney‟s objection when the issue of a mistrial was raised.” Because Hall “chose not to pursue a mistrial but [rather] to allow the trial to continue with a curative instruction,” counsel concluded that the postconviction-relief claim was without merit.', 'At the October 19, 2009 hearing on Hall‟s application, the trial justice granted counsel‟s motion to withdraw. The trial justice informed Hall that he would not provide him with another lawyer, but stated that he would hear Hall‟s arguments. Hall simply pointed to his application— which was “right there in front of [the trial justice]”—but did not offer anything other than the contention that he was “railroaded” and “the whole case, period, was bogus.” In requesting that the application be denied, the state argued that Hall had fallen short of his burden of proof; none of the issues raised in the postconviction-relief application were raised on direct appeal. The trial justice found that “[c]autionary instructions were offered, requested, given,” and “[t]he transcript clearly reflects every effort to provide [Hall] with a fair trial.”2 The trial justice found that the application was “devoid of any merit whatsoever” and denied and dismissed it.', 'On appeal to this Court, Hall raises one claim of error: “he did not receive a fair and impartial trial due to vouching by one of the [state‟s] * * * witnesses * * * [that was] done in the presence of the [j]ury.”3 He argues that it is “naïve” to assume that “prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury” and, in fact, the damaging testimony “created a strong impression on the [j]ury.” The cautionary instruction, according to Hall, did not cure the 2', 'When pressed regarding his allegation that he was “railroaded,” Hall conceded that he had no basis for that contention. 3', 'Hall filed his postconviction-relief application and appeal pro se; appellate counsel was appointed by this Court.', '-3- prejudicial effects of the testimony and “[t]he trial justice * * * did commit error of [a] constitutional magnitude by allowing the trial to proceed.”', 'Standard of Review', 'The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1 is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant‟s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.” Sosa v.

However, we conclude that this issue has been waived. The record establishes that the trial justice provided Hall with two choices: mistrial or a cautionary instruction. Hall elected the cautionary instruction, thereby waiving any right to a mistrial. Hall received the remedy of his own choice; he failed to object to the instruction at the time it was given; and he did not raise the issue on direct appeal. It is apparent that Hall and his trial attorney were well aware of the grounds upon which a mistrial could have been granted; the trial justice openly offered that remedy as an alternative to the cautionary instruction.', 'The purported inadequacy of the cautionary instruction is likewise barred by res judicata,', '-5- and, as a result, is not properly before us.

Here, Hall could have raised the issue of the alleged improper cautionary instruction on direct appeal and, therefore, he was barred from raising the claim in his application for postconviction relief.

82,v. : Maria Checrallah et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Maria Checrallah, 1 appeals from a Superior Court order granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Thomas A. Tarro, III, and The Law Firm of Thomas A. Tarro, III (collectively Tarro or plaintiffs) and awarding the plaintiffs $187,500 in attorneys’ fees owed by the defendant under a 1989 retainer agreement, plus prejudgment interest amounting to $113,386.50. On appeal, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that any recovery by the plaintiffs should be limited to the value of the work Tarro actually performed for the defendant. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Initially, both Maria Checrallah and Victory Finishing Technologies, Inc. (Victory) were named as defendants in this case (plaintiffs having sought injunctive relief against Victory). Victory has since been dissolved through a final judgment in receivership, however, and it is not a party to this appeal.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History 2', 'In March 1989, defendant hired Tarro to “prosecute and settle all claims for damage against [her father’s estate] and [her brother] or others who shall be liable on account of the handling of [her father’s estate] before and after his death.” The retainer agreement provided that defendant would pay Tarro “a sum equal to Fifteen (15%) Percent of whatever may be recovered from said claim either by suit, settlement or any other manner.” Specifically, Tarro assisted defendant in establishing her interest in a promissory note (Victory note) in the amount of $2,390,000 payable by Victory Finishing Technologies, Inc. (Victory) to her father’s estate. Shortly thereafter, Tarro negotiated a settlement (probate settlement) between defendant and her brother whereby defendant would receive one half of her father’s estate, including one half of the interest and principal payable under the terms of the Victory note. The defendant’s brother was appointed to serve as executor of their father’s estate.', 'After executing the settlement agreement, defendant signed an attorney authorization agreement, in which she acknowledged that Tarro would act as her agent in collecting the sums due under the settlement agreement, and that he would “continue to be [her] legal representative with respect to any issues regarding [her father’s estate].” 3 Pursuant to this agreement, over the next decade, Tarro received 122 payments on behalf of defendant and distributed 85 percent of each to defendant, keeping 15 percent of each installment to cover his agreed-upon fee. In 1999, 2', 'In reviewing a lower court’s grant of summary judgment, we “view[] the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party * * *.” Delta Airlines, Inc. v. Neary, 785 A.2d 1123, 1126 (R.I. 2001). The defendant has acknowledged that “facts material to this action are not in dispute,” and, unless otherwise indicated, all facts noted herein are undisputed. 3', 'The defendant was deposed about the probate settlement shortly after that settlement was reached. At that deposition, defendant twice indicated her understanding that payments owed under the probate settlement would be sent directly to Tarro before being distributed to her.', '-2- Tarro successfully petitioned the Probate Court to have defendant’s brother removed as executor of their father’s estate and a new administrator appointed. Victory later entered receivership and the probate estate’s new administrator filed a claim on behalf of the estate in the Victory receivership proceeding. In February 2002, Tarro also served Victory’s receiver with notice of his attorney’s lien in connection with amounts still owed to defendant under the note.', 'In July 2002, defendant discharged Tarro as her attorney and directed him to release her file to successor counsel. In 2005, with the assistance of successor counsel, defendant settled her claim pertaining to the Victory note in the receivership proceeding (receivership settlement). Under the terms of that settlement agreement, defendant accepted $1,250,000 as full payment of her claim (at that time, $1,486,524.72 was due to her under the Victory note). An initial $100,000 payment was to be made within ninety days, with the balance due in two years. After that initial payment was made, the receivership settlement agreement was amended to require a $200,000 payment by August 2006, with the balance due by August 2007. Upon Tarro’s motion, the justice overseeing the Victory receivership ordered that $30,000 of the $200,000 payment be withheld and deposited into the Registry of the Court so that Tarro could seek to enforce an attorney’s lien. 4 It is also undisputed that defendant has received the final $950,000 payment and that Tarro has not received any portion of the $100,000 payment or the $950,000 payment.', 'The plaintiffs filed suit against defendant in Superior Court alleging breach of contract and other related causes of action. Specifically, the complaint alleged that defendant breached her contract with plaintiffs by failing to pay 15 percent of each payment received under the receivership settlement as was required by the 1989 retainer agreement. The defendant denied these allegations and counterclaimed, asserting that plaintiffs breached the retainer agreement by 4', 'The Superior Court since has ordered the release of this money to Tarro.', '-3- failing to provide “effective and zealous legal representation,” and committed attorney malpractice.', 'The defendant further pleaded that plaintiffs’ omissions caused her to incur additional legal expenses. The plaintiffs responded that defendant’s counterclaims were barred by the statute of limitations and moved that the Superior Court either dismiss them or grant summary judgment on them. On June 1, 2007, the Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on all of defendant’s counterclaims.', 'Subsequently, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their own claims, arguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact about whether plaintiffs were entitled to collect 15 percent of the payments that defendant received under the receivership settlement.', 'The defendant responded with a two-sentence objection, contending only that plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The defendant did not attach a supporting memorandum, affidavits, or any other materials to this submission; but, at a hearing before the Superior Court, she explained her position that plaintiffs were not entitled to a contingency fee for any amounts recovered in connection with the receivership settlement because Tarro had been discharged long before that settlement was reached. The defendant argued that, at most, Tarro would be entitled to recover under quantum meruit for the value of the services he provided. On October 5, 2010, after hearing arguments from both parties, the trial justice granted summary judgment for plaintiffs, reasoning that Tarro earned 15 percent of any amounts received by defendant when he successfully negotiated the probate settlement in 1989, and therefore, that there was no genuine issue of fact concerning amounts owed under the retainer agreement.', 'The plaintiffs were', '-4- awarded $187,500 (15 percent of the receivership settlement amount), as well as prejudgment interest.

Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 419 n.10 (R.I. 2011).', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant maintains that summary judgment was inappropriate because, “although the facts material to this action are not in dispute, [plaintiffs] were not entitled to the [j]udgment as a matter of law.” Specifically, defendant argues that, although Tarro was entitled to receive 15 percent of any amounts he actually collected, he is not entitled to any percentage of amounts collected after defendant discharged him. The defendant points out that successor counsel, rather than Tarro, negotiated the receivership settlement on her behalf, and asserts that “[plaintiffs] were not entitled to receive their contingent fee from a settlement [in] which they [played] no role * * * negotiating or recovering.” Finally, defendant posits that, to the extent plaintiffs are entitled to any fees in this matter, it would be for the value of services rendered under a quantum meruit theory. The plaintiffs respond that the lower court’s grant of summary judgment should be affirmed because no material facts are in dispute and under “[t]he traditional contract rule[,] * * * when an attorney has a written contingency contract and is discharged, without cause, the attorney is entitled to the full percentage of [his] fee upon recovery by the client.”', 'As we previously have declared, “[i]t is well settled that a client has the right to discharge his attorney at any time, with or without cause, subject, however, to the responsibility for the consequences of the breach of the contract of employment.” Lake v. Winfield Fuller Co., 54 R.I. 358, 360, 173 A. 119, 120 (1934). Moreover, “[a]fter discharge without cause, the attorney is always entitled to recover an amount based on the reasonable value of the services performed.” Id. Authorities explain that when an attorney’s receipt of fees is contingent upon a particular outcome, “[t]he happening of the contingency is a condition precedent to the right of the attorney', '-6- to recover for his or her services, and the precise event which was contemplated must happen.” 7 Am. Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law § 258 at 307 (2007) (citing case law from various jurisdictions). Thus, when a client discharges his or her attorney without cause prior to full performance of all duties, the attorney’s recovery generally is limited to the value of services rendered under a quantum meruit theory. See id. § 281 at 326-27; see also Fracasse v. Brent, 494 P.2d 9, 10 (Cal. 1972) (en banc) (holding that, when an attorney under a contingency fee contract had been discharged without cause prior to the occurrence of the contingency, “the attorney should be limited to a quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of his services”). However, when an attorney is discharged, having already substantially performed the duties owed to the client, and only “minor and relatively unimportant deviations remain to accomplish full contractual performance,” the attorney is entitled to the entire contingency fee. 7 Am. Jur. 2d § 281 at 326- 27. This final proposition comports with the traditional contract principle, long recognized by this Court, that “a court may award damages for breach of contract to place the injured party in as good a position as if the parties fully performed the contract,” Sophie F. Bronowiski Mulligan Irrevocable Trust v. Bridges, 44 A.3d 116, 120 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Riley v.

For example, the Appellate Court of Connecticut determined that an attorney retained on a contingency fee basis who was discharged after settlement had been reached was entitled to the full fee amount, even though his “performance', '-7- was less than exemplary” and the client had retained additional counsel to aid in settlement negotiations. McCullough v. Waterside Associates, 925 A.2d 352, 354, 355, 357 (Conn.

See also Zaklama v. Mount Sinai Medical Center, 906 F.2d 650, 652-53 (11th Cir. 1990) (holding that, when a law firm was discharged after obtaining a settlement for its client in an employment discrimination case, it was entitled to its full contingency fee, reasoning that “[a] client may not accept the benefits of a valid contingency fee contract and subsequently contest his obligations thereunder”); MacInnis v. Pope, 285 P.2d 688, 689-90 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1955) (holding that, when an attorney under a contingency fee agreement was discharged after successfully negotiating and collecting a settlement on his client’s behalf, he was entitled to his full contingency fee and noting that “[i]t would seem unnecessary to cite authority for the point that when an attorney fully performs the services required by the contract he is entitled to the fee stipulated in the contract”).', 'Here, the defendant has conceded that “the facts material to this action are not in dispute.” Thus, it is undisputed that Tarro agreed to represent the defendant in her father’s probate proceedings and that in exchange for any settlement he negotiated on her behalf, he would receive 15 percent of any amounts she recovered.', 'It is also undisputed that Tarro successfully negotiated the probate settlement under the terms of which the defendant was to receive one half the interest and principal payable under the Victory note.', 'The retainer agreement expressly provided that Tarro was to “prosecute and settle all claims” in connection', '-8- with the defendant’s father’s estate and that in exchange for those services, the defendant would pay him “[f]ifteen (15%) [p]ercent of whatever may be recovered from said claim by suit, settlement or any other manner.” (Emphasis added.) We are of the opinion that, upon reaching the original probate settlement agreement, Tarro had performed his duties to the defendant under the retainer agreement and that, as soon as the defendant’s claim was reduced to a settlement, he became entitled to 15 percent of any amounts ultimately received by the defendant under the probate settlement. Therefore, at the time the defendant discharged Tarro, his right to receive his fee from amounts eventually recovered by the defendant had vested, and the fact that the defendant subsequently discharged Tarro does not alter his entitlement to fees already earned. Similarly, the fact that the defendant undertook additional collection efforts at a later date (with the help of successor counsel), does not diminish or impair Tarro’s right to his contingency fee. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment. 6', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment, and we remand the case to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia did not participate. 6', 'The plaintiffs have consistently taken the position that they are entitled to 15 percent of any amounts actually recovered by defendant under the receivership agreement, rather than 15 percent of what she expected to receive when she agreed to the original probate settlement. The Superior Court awarded plaintiffs 15 percent of the receivership settlement amount; and, since plaintiffs have not argued that they are entitled to any greater amount, we will not disturb the Superior Court’s damages calculation.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'The Law Firm of Thomas A.

Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred by admitting into evidence photographs of his tattoos, which photographs also depicted his face “in a ‘scruffy’ and disheveled condition.”', 'As such, the defendant contends that the unredacted photographs showing his face should not have been admitted because portraying his face in the pictures was not relevant and was unduly prejudicial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On July 27, 2010, sometime after 5:30 p.m., three people entered the apartment of Jose Silva and Wandalyz Maldonado in the Federal Hill area of the City of Providence. Their friends Jason Weeks and Angelina Breault also were visiting with their son at that time. At trial, Silva testified that while sitting in the parlor, he heard the kitchen door open and went to see who it was. When he entered the kitchen, he saw a “man with a mask on his face and a gun,” 1 who was 1', 'Silva testified that the mask was a white hockey mask similar to the one worn by the character Jason in the movie Friday the 13th.', '-1- wearing a white “wife-beater” 2 and shorts, as well as two other men whose faces also were covered.', 'Silva testified that the masked man with the gun backed him into the parlor and asked him three times, in a “very high-pitched” tone, “Where’s the money?”—to which Silva replied that he did not have any money. Further, Silva testified that the man then hit him three times in the back of his head with the gun. After the third blow, the gunman “fired a shot” that left a “hole in the floor two inches away from * * * the bouncer chair where [Silva’s infant daughter] was sitting.” He also lunged at the child, but instead, grabbed the television and ran out the door. Silva and Weeks ran after the men, and Silva testified that he saw his television, a red shirt, and a red hat lying in a driveway around the corner from his house.', 'The gunman’s face could not be identified because of the mask; and, therefore, an issue in the trial was the use of the gunman’s tattoos as a means of identification. Maldonado testified that the gunman was Hispanic, with black-ink letters tattooed on each of his arms, but she also clarified that she did not recall his tattoo being a “sleeve.” 3 During cross-examination she admitted that, at an earlier proceeding, she had testified that the gunman’s tattoo “was like rims of clouds”; and she also admitted that, when the police had originally shown her pictures of various tattoos, she had pointed to a photograph of a tattoo pattern that she thought could have been the shooter’s. The picture that Maldonado selected, however, was not of defendant’s tattoos. Maldonado also testified at the trial that she could not remember the tattoos and stated that she did not know whether defendant actually played a role in the invasion of her home. 2', 'A “wife-beater” was described as a slang word for “a sleeveless tank top style T-shirt.” 3', 'Maldonado defined a “sleeve” as referring to a person’s whole arm being covered in tattoos.', '-2-', 'Similarly, Breault testified that the gunman had “a couple tattoos,” one that was “writing [or] lettering” on his right arm and another on his shoulder. 4 She stated that, a few weeks after the crime, she was shown the photograph that Maldonado had identified as possibly depicting the gunman’s tattoo, but did not recognize it as the tattoo on the arm of the gunman. However, when shown a photograph of defendant’s right arm, she positively identified it as being that of the gunman. According to Breault, while the gunman and Silva were wrestling, the gunman’s shirt was pulled up, revealing a “weird” tattoo on his chest that “look[ed] like a circle or like [an] oval shape” and seemed like it was “homemade.”', 'Christina Bartley also testified at trial. 5 She stated that on July 27, 2010, her boyfriend, Devon Letourneau, picked her up from work when her shift ended at approximately 4:30 p.m. Letourneau was with defendant and Joshua Ortiz, two people that Bartley said she did not know at that time. After leaving her workplace, she drove while Letourneau sat in the front passenger seat and defendant and Ortiz sat in the back seat. According to Bartley, they were merely driving around when defendant took a phone call. After he ended the call, defendant “started talking about committing a robbery” and said, “[w]e should run up in home boy’s crib.” 6 Ortiz similarly testified that a conversation about robbing Silva and Maldonado for marijuana and money had taken place.', 'Bartley testified that she pulled over to the side of the road, and that defendant and Letourneau then got out of the car, went to the trunk, and “got back in the car with a gun and [a] 4', 'Breault testified that she did not know whether the gunman had a tattoo on his left arm because she did not get a chance to see his left arm. 5', 'After her arrest, Bartley entered into a cooperation agreement with the state, in which she agreed to testify about the events that occurred on July 27, 2010, in exchange for a reduced sentence. 6', 'Bartley explained that she understood the phrase, “run up in home boy’s crib” to mean that defendant was “going to rob somebody.”', '-3- Jason mask.” She specified that Letourneau originally held the gun and that defendant held the mask, but that Letourneau handed the gun to defendant after they got back in the car. Bartley stated that she drove to Almy Street and parked. The three men got out of the car, and then she left the area. 7 Ortiz testified that during the robbery he remained near the stairs in Silva’s apartment building and could not see what was going on inside the apartment; however, he stated that he did hear defendant demand money and Letourneau say, “Hit him. Hit him.” Ortiz stated that there was a lot of screaming, and then defendant fired the gun, causing everyone to run out of the house.', 'The defendant was indicted by a grand jury on October 28, 2010, on five counts: 8 (1) robbery in the first degree, (2) conspiracy to commit robbery, (3) breaking and entering a dwelling without consent while the owner was on the premises, (4) carrying a firearm without a license, and (5) using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence.', 'A jury trial commenced on July 25, 2011, during which Paul Ledoux, a correctional officer at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), testified that after defendant had been taken for DNA testing on January 25, 2011, he was “[h]oller[ing] back and forth to another inmate basically stating, ‘How do they know it was me? Everybody was wearing a mask.’”', 'Cara Lupino, the supervisor and technical leader of the DNA laboratory at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Biology Laboratory, also testified that the laboratory received various clothing and personal accessories, as well as DNA profiles from Ortiz, Letourneau, and defendant.', 'According to Lupino, after the red T-shirt was tested, it was 7', 'Ortiz testified that when they got out of the car, Letourneau had both the mask and the gun in his hands, but when they arrived upstairs to Silva’s apartment, Letourneau had neither item. 8', 'The indictment charged defendant, Letourneau, and Ortiz each with five counts, each count alleging a different crime; however, Letourneau’s case subsequently was severed from defendant’s, and Ortiz entered into a plea agreement with the state in exchange for information and his testimony.', '-4- concluded that defendant was “a possible contributor to th[e] DNA type” found on the collar of the shirt. The defendant testified in his own defense, denying any involvement in the robbery.', 'On July 29, 2010, the jury found defendant guilty of all five counts. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial on August 16, 2011, which the trial justice denied after a hearing. Sentencing took place on September 28, 2011, at which time the trial justice imposed a sentence of thirty years to serve on count 1; a consecutive ten-year term, without parole, on count 5; and on counts 2, 3, and 4, three consecutive ten-year terms to serve, suspended, with probation to start after the completion of the jail term on counts 1 and 5.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The sole issue raised by defendant on appeal concerns the admission into evidence of the unredacted photographs depicting defendant’s face as well as his tattoos. “The admission of photographic evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1013 (R.I. 2005). When challenged as unduly prejudicial, “[t]he test is whether the photograph is of such a nature as to inflame the jurors and therefore prejudice them beyond the ordinary prejudice that is always sustained by the introduction of relevant evidence intended to prove guilt.” Id. at 1019 (quoting State v. Belloli, 766 A.2d 928, 930 (R.I. 2001)). “As with the admission of evidence generally, determining the relevance of photographs is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Belloli, 766 A.2d at 930 (quoting State v. Spratt, 742 A.2d 1194, 1198 (R.I. 1999)). “Moreover, ‘[a] photograph is relevant if it has a tendency to prove or disprove some material fact in issue.’” Id.

He contends that the admission of these pictures was unnecessary, not relevant, and unduly prejudicial because they were taken at the ACI and showed his face at a time when he was “in a ‘scruffy’ and disheveled condition.” Further, defendant asserts that, “more importantly, the inclusion of his face in the photographs might well have influenced the witnesses’ identifications of the tattoos, since the witnesses were then able to compare the face in the photographs with defendant’s face as he was seated at counsel table during the course of the trial.”', 'The state counters that', '“allowing the [s]tate’s witnesses to view defendant’s face in the', 'photographs was especially important since the three intruders', 'covered their faces during the course of the crime * * * and the', 'witnesses’ ability to view defendant’s face at trial allowed jurors to', 'make the connection between the tattoos and defendant while also', 'enabling the witnesses to check the proportion of his head to his', 'body.” 9', 'Rule 403 of the Rules of Evidence states that, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', '-6- The state contends that “the trial justice acted well within his discretion when he concluded that defendant did not ‘look[] as scruffy’ in the photographs as defense counsel alleged,” but instead “look[ed] pretty much like he does today other than some facial hair along his chin.”', 'The defendant asserts that “[t]he practice of redacting photographs of defendants before their submission to a jury, to sanitize them of irrelevant or unduly prejudicial content, is hardly unusual.” He further states that courts have “routinely require[d] ‘mug shot’ or ‘rogue’s gallery’ [sic] photographs to be redacted so as to remove information contained therein that discloses a defendant’s past police history.” The defendant urges this Court to analyze the admission of his photographs under the test we applied to mug shots and articulated in State v. Lemon, 456 A.2d 261, 265 (R.I. 1983) (“(1) the prosecution must have a demonstrable need to introduce the photographs; (2) the photographs themselves, if shown to the jury, must not imply that the defendant had a prior criminal record; and (3) the manner of introduction at trial must be such that it does not draw particular attention to the source or implications of the photographs”).', 'After reviewing the photographs at issue, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion. It is clear to this Court that these are not typical “mug shot” photographs of defendant. Although they were taken at the ACI, the photographs contain no obvious indicia that defendant was incarcerated at the time. The defendant is not wearing a prison badge, the photographs were not taken against a background of horizontal lines marking his height, and there is not a nameplate in the photograph. Accordingly, the Lemon test is not applicable to the photographs under review.', 'Furthermore, we note that the trial justice addressed the defendant’s objection as well as practical concerns with redacting the photographs. The trial justice stated:', '-7-', '“I don’t think that there’s any prejudice in showing the defendant’s', 'face in these photographs. I don’t think he looks scruffy as you', 'claim. He has some moderate facial hair, but, other than that, he', 'looks pretty much like he does today, other than some facial hair', 'along his chin. Many of the Letourneau photographs don’t have', 'Mr. Letourneau’s face in them, and, in order that the photographs', 'not be mixed up as to which tattoos belong to which person, I think', 'it’s important that the jury recognize that the tattoos that adorn the', 'arm and chest of this defendant in fact include his face so there’s', 'no confusion.” We perceive no abuse of discretion in either the trial justice’s determination that the pictures showing the defendant’s face were relevant or in admitting the photographs into evidence. Rather, he appropriately weighed the probative value of the photographs against the probability of undue prejudice, finding that the defendant looked “pretty much” the same in the photographs as he did in the courtroom.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in admitting the unredacted photographs of the defendant’s tattoos.

84,State : v. : Cory J. Roberts. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Cory J. Roberts, appeals from a decision arising from a motion to correct a sentence of imprisonment that was executed after a finding of probation violation. In this procedurally challenging case, the defendant contends that the trial justice who presided over his 2004 probation-revocation hearing erroneously stayed the execution of ten years of a previously suspended fifteen-year sentence. From that premise, the defendant argues that, notwithstanding that the trial justice subsequently corrected that illegal sentence, it was no longer a viable sentence, such that he improperly was adjudged to be a probation violator in 2009. Finally, the defendant asserts that, after correcting his error, the trial justice impermissibly resentenced the defendant. After careful consideration, we affirm the judgment below.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1992, defendant, who then was eighteen years old, entered pleas of nolo contendere to a host of charges, including first- and second-degree child molestation, resisting arrest, and multiple counts of breaking and entering and simple assault and battery. These offenses included', '-1- multiple home invasions and child sexual assaults upon the occupants. The defendant was sentenced to thirty years on each of the molestation counts, with fifteen years to serve, fifteen years suspended, with probation.', 'In May 2001, shortly after his release from incarceration, defendant was convicted of residential burglary in the State of Washington. That offense was similar to the crimes for which defendant was imprisoned in 1992; it involved breaking and entering into a home, during which defendant awakened a woman who was asleep in bed with her husband. The defendant was incarcerated in the State of Washington and subsequently was adjudicated a probation violator in Superior Court in March 2004. After determining that defendant was a probation violator, the trial justice wrestled with the difficult decision of what portion of defendant‟s fifteen-year suspended sentence should be executed.', 'The trial justice first heard argument from defense counsel, who represented to the court that defendant “has absolutely no problem with the vacating of [defendant‟s previously suspended] sentence and [then] staying a large portion of that sentence and as a condition of that stay, imposing a requirement that [defendant undergo] sex offender counseling. [The defendant] has no problem with [undergoing] sex offender counseling at all.” For its part, in a sentencing memorandum, the state requested that defendant serve all fifteen years remaining on the child- molestation counts; it emphasized the similarity between the Rhode Island and Washington crimes.', 'Before proceeding to announce his decision, the trial justice declared that “this is one of the most difficult sentencing decisions I‟ve ever had to make or be a part of.” On the one hand, the trial justice recognized that the Rhode Island offenses of which defendant stands convicted are very serious; he also found that defendant was a “predator.” On the other hand, the trial', '-2- justice was troubled that defendant appeared not to know what made him commit these crimes. In an effort to balance these concerns, the trial justice vacated the suspension of the fifteen-year sentence on the 1992 child-molestation convictions, ordered defendant to serve five years of the fifteen-year sentence, consecutive to the term then being served by defendant as a parole violator,1 and ordered that the execution of the remaining ten years be “stayed” on condition that, upon his release from prison, defendant immediately engage in and remain compliant with an approved sex-offender treatment program. The trial justice further provided that, if defendant failed to enroll in an approved sex-offender treatment program within thirty days of his release from prison and if he did not remain in treatment until its successful completion, the so-called “stay of execution” of the ten-year term would be vacated and he would serve all ten years in prison. The defendant failed to live up to these requirements.', 'In March 2009, in accordance with Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the state filed a probation-violation report against defendant, alleging that, shortly after being released from prison, defendant had left the state without permission and that he had been arrested in Virginia. The defendant admitted the violation, and the trial justice who had ordered the so-called “stayed” sentence in 2004 removed the stay of execution on the remaining ten years of defendant‟s sentence and ordered defendant to serve eight years, with the remaining two years further stayed.', 'On April 1, 2010, defendant filed a pro se motion under Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure to correct the 2004 sentence, focusing on the stayed component of the sentence. The defendant argued that the trial justice was without authority to impose a “stayed sentence” and that only the five-year term of incarceration—which defendant already 1', 'The defendant also was a parole violator with respect to the original fifteen-year prison term.', '-3- had served—was lawful. Counsel was appointed to represent defendant on this motion.2 The state raised several arguments in support of its objection to the motion to correct sentence, including, inter alia, timeliness, laches, and estoppel.3', 'The trial justice issued a written order granting in part defendant‟s motion to correct his 2004 sentence. Although the trial justice recognized the irony arising from the fact that “the stayed sentence imposed was designed to grant [defendant] some level of leniency” and was negotiated by counsel on behalf of defendant—who readily agreed to accept it—he nonetheless concluded that “the sentence modification in 2004 was impermissible as a matter of law.” Accordingly, the trial justice vacated the sentence that was ordered in connection with the 2004 violation adjudication.', 'The defendant was resentenced on August 26, 2010. Before pronouncing sentence, the trial justice entertained argument from defendant and the state. The defendant argued that, when he completed the five-year term imposed in 2004, the entire sentence was satisfied.', 'The defendant further contended that, because the ten-year stayed sentence was illegal, it was null and void ab initio and that, therefore, he could not be presented as a probation violator in 2009— since, he argued, after completing the 2004 incarcerative term, he no longer was on probation. In response, the state argued that, when the trial justice ordered that defendant serve five years of 2', 'Relatedly, defendant subsequently filed a pro se motion to vacate the sentence he received as a result of his 2009 adjudication of probation violation; he contended that because the only sentence outstanding at the time of his departure from this state was the illegal ten-year stayed sentence, there was no probationary term in 2009 and that, therefore, defendant could not be adjudicated a probation violator. However, the trial justice returned this motion to defendant because it was not submitted through appointed counsel. 3', 'Because of our decision affirming the trial justice on the merits, we need not address these contentions, save for brief consideration of the question of timeliness under Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-4- the then-suspended fifteen years, the ten-year balance simply remained as a suspended portion of the original sentence and did not vanish, as defendant appeared to argue.', 'The trial justice rejected defendant‟s argument that the ten-year stayed sentence no longer existed, concluding that, at a probation-revocation proceeding, a trial justice is powerless to reduce the sentence imposed by the original sentencing justice. Accordingly, the trial justice issued two orders to effectuate his original intention when executing the sentences in 2004 and again in 2009. The first judgment was ordered nunc pro tunc to March 18, 2004 and executed five years of defendant‟s previously suspended fifteen-year sentence, with the remaining ten years suspended, with probation. The second judgment, nunc pro tunc to September 1, 2009, executed eight years of defendant‟s previously suspended ten-year sentence, with the remaining two years further suspended, with probation. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that “[d]ecisions concerning Rule 35 motions are within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Brown, 755 A.2d 124, 125 (R.I. 2000); see also State v. Bouffard, 35 A.3d 909, 916 (R.I. 2012). Accordingly, “[o]ur authority to review a trial justice‟s decision on such a motion „is extremely limited and should be exercised only when the sentence is without justification[,]‟” Brown, 755 A.2d at 125 (quoting State v. Brigham, 666 A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1995)), and “grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” State v. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 101 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Ruffner, 5 A.3d 864, 867 (R.I. 2010)). “When faced with the interpretation of statutes and court rules upon review of a Rule 35 motion, however, we apply a de novo standard.” Bouffard, 35 A.3d at 916; see also State v. Goncalves, 941 A.2d 842, 847 (R.I. 2008). Finally, with respect to a trial justice‟s decision to execute all or a portion of a defendant‟s previously suspended sentence after a', '-5- finding of probation violation, “[t]he [trial justice] has wide discretion when determining the proper sentence to exact upon a probation violator,” and we will uphold that decision unless it constitutes an abuse of that discretion. State v. Lancellotta, 35 A.3d 863, 869 (R.I. 2012).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant contends, as he argued below, that the ten-year stayed sentence that was executed in 2004 was null and void and that after serving the five-year incarcerative term, the entire sentence was satisfied. The defendant further contends that his Rule 35 motion only attacked the illegal portion of his 2004 sentence—the ten-year stayed sentence—and that the trial justice, having determined that the stayed sentence was unlawful, erred in resentencing him on the entire 2004 sentence. Finally, defendant argues that he should not have been adjudicated a probation violator in 2009 because the only sentence remaining was the illegal ten-year stayed sentence. Indeed, defendant submits that his due process rights were violated when he was presented and sentenced as a probation violator in 2009. We reject these contentions.', 'At the outset, we address an issue of timeliness. Rule 35(a) sets forth the temporal limitations on a motion to correct a sentence and provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The court may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and it may reduce any sentence when a motion is filed within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the sentence is imposed * * *.” (Emphases added.) For timing purposes, Rule 35(a) thus distinguishes between two types of sentences: illegal sentences and sentences imposed in an illegal manner. In this case, defendant‟s motion to correct his 2004 sentence was filed on April 1, 2010—well beyond the 120-day limit for correcting a sentence imposed in an', '-6- illegal manner.4 Therefore, defendant‟s motion to correct was timely only to the extent, if any, it challenged an “illegal sentence” under Rule 35(a).', 'We have explained that an illegal sentence under Rule 35(a) is “one that is not authorized by the statute establishing the punishment that may be imposed for the particular crime or crimes.” State v. Linde, 965 A.2d 415, 417 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 143 (R.I. 2008)). The Reporter‟s Notes to Rule 35(a) provide:', '“For purposes of the rule, an „illegal sentence‟ is one which has', 'been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under', 'law. It includes, e.g., a sentence in excess of that provided by', 'statute, imposition of an unauthorized form of punishment, a', 'judgment that does not conform to the oral sentence.”', 'The state insists that defendant‟s Rule 35 motion only alleged that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner—not that he received an illegal sentence—and that it therefore was time-barred. In response, defendant contends that the trial justice exceeded his authority under G.L. 1956 § 12-19-9 in staying the execution of his previously suspended sentence upon condition that he engage in and remain compliant with sex-offender treatment. Although this is a close question, we are satisfied that this contention is more closely akin to a challenge to an illegal sentence. See State v. Tucker, 747 A.2d 451, 453 (R.I. 2000). In Tucker, 747 A.2d at 453, the defendant filed a Rule 35 motion to correct his sentence, arguing that the probation- revocation trial justice did not have the authority under § 12-19-9 to execute a portion of his 4', 'Although defendant‟s motion focused on the sentence he received at the 2004 probation- revocation hearing, we note that the 120-day period in Rule 35(a) begins to run on the date of the final judgment of conviction, and not on the date that a defendant‟s probation is revoked. See State v. Brown, 821 A.2d 695, 696-97 n.2 (R.I. 2003) (“It is well settled that a trial justice does not impose a new sentence after a probation revocation hearing, but rather executes the previously imposed sentence. * * * Thus, a motion to reduce sentence must be filed within 120 days of the final judgment of conviction.”).', '-7- previously suspended sentence and simultaneously continue the rest of his suspended sentence. We deemed the defendant‟s argument to be a challenge to an illegal sentence:', '“Tucker‟s position is that the violation-hearing justice imposed an', 'illegal sentence upon him when he ordered him to serve eighteen', 'months of his prior-suspended sentence and continued the', 'suspension for the remaining fifty-four months of his original', 'sentence. Thus, the expiration of Rule 35‟s 120-day time limit did', 'not preclude the court from addressing the merits of Tucker‟s', 'argument.” Tucker, 747 A.2d at 453. We therefore proceed to address the merits of defendant‟s contentions.', '“The General Assembly set forth various disposition options from which a violation- hearing justice can choose after finding that a defendant has violated his or her condition(s) of probation.” Tucker, 747 A.2d at 453. Those options are set forth in § 12-19-9, which provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“Upon a determination that the defendant has violated the terms', 'and conditions of his or her probation the court, in open court and', 'in the presence of the defendant, may remove the suspension and', 'order the defendant committed on the sentence previously', 'imposed, or on a lesser sentence, or impose a sentence if one has', 'not been previously imposed, or may continue the suspension of a', 'sentence previously imposed, as to the court may seem just and', 'proper.”', 'In this case, after declaring defendant a probation violator in 2004, the trial justice ordered defendant to serve five years of the original fifteen-year suspended sentence and stayed execution of the remaining ten years on condition that defendant engage in and remain compliant with sex-offender counseling.', 'Although “the General Assembly intended that a violation- hearing justice would have considerable discretion in selecting which of the options in § 12-19-9 he or she would apply to a probation violator and in deciding how those options would be applied,” Tucker, 747 A.2d at 453-54, a probation-revocation justice has no discretion to fashion a sentence that is not allowed by law. Section 12-19-9, which we have declared “clear and', '-8- unambiguous,” State v. Parson, 844 A.2d 178, 180 (R.I. 2004), does not permit a trial justice to stay the execution of a previously suspended sentence. Recognizing his error, the trial justice corrected the error and resentenced defendant.', 'However, our conclusion that the trial justice had no authority under § 12-19-9 to stay the execution of defendant‟s suspended sentence is but a partial victory for defendant.', 'The defendant argues that the ten-year stayed sentence was null and void ab initio and therefore disappeared, leaving only the completed five-year incarcerative term. This contention runs afoul of our decision in State v. Heath, 659 A.2d 116 (R.I. 1995).', 'In Heath, 659 A.2d at 116, the defendant originally received a five-year sentence, with six months to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. On several occasions, the defendant was adjudged a probation violator. Id. On the third occasion, the trial justice ordered the defendant to serve six months, but the justice neglected to mention the fate of the remaining three and one-half years of the suspended sentence. Id. When the defendant was once again adjudged a probation violator, he argued that he no longer was on probation because the justice presiding over his third probation-revocation hearing had not ordered any suspended sentence when imposing the defendant‟s six-month prison term. Id. The trial justice, and later this Court, rejected that argument. Id. at 116-17. We explained that “the intention of the justice who originally imposed the suspended sentences is controlling and that the justice who finds a violation of probationary status and executes the sentence is bound by the initial determination.” Id. at 116 (quoting State v. Studman, 468 A.2d 918, 920 (R.I. 1983)). With this limitation on a probation-revocation justice‟s authority in mind, we held that a “trial justice at [a] violation hearing [does] not possess the statutory power to amend or decrease the sentence as originally imposed and [is] bound by the terms of that sentence.”', 'Id. at 117. We repeatedly have', '-9- reaffirmed our holding in Heath. See, e.g., State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1159 (R.I. 2005) (mem.); Tucker, 747 A.2d at 454-55; State v. Rice, 727 A.2d 1229, 1231 (R.I. 1999).', 'Our decision in Heath forecloses defendant‟s argument that the ten years of the previously suspended sentence that had been stayed by the probation-revocation justice no longer existed. If a probation-revocation justice lacks the statutory power to amend or reduce the sentence purposefully, surely he or she may not accomplish that result unintentionally, in the course of a display of compassion and grace to the violator. In this case, therefore, the trial justice‟s error in staying the execution of the ten years remaining on the previously suspended sentence did not vitiate that portion of the sentence that the original sentencing justice had imposed. Appropriately recognizing that he could not reduce the sentence imposed by the original sentencing justice, the trial justice reevaluated his sentence and accomplished that which he intended in the first place.', 'The defendant insists that this resentencing was error; because he had challenged only the illegal portion of his 2004 sentence, he argues, the trial justice erred in recalibrating the entire sentence that was executed in 2004. To support this contention, he cites two federal court decisions—United States v. Henry, 709 F.2d 298, 307-08 (5th Cir. 1983) (en banc); United States v. Turner, 518 F.2d 14, 15-17 (7th Cir. 1975)—one of which has been overruled, and the second overwhelmingly has been rejected. See United States v. Jefferson, 714 F.2d 689, 707 (7th Cir. 1983), vacated on other grounds, 474 U.S. 806 (1985) (mem.) (overruling Turner); see, e.g., United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9, 14 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc) (rejecting Henry); United States v. Bentley, 850 F.2d 327, 329 (7th Cir. 1988) (same). We need not accompany defendant on his cross-country tour, however, for the issue is well settled in this jurisdiction.', '- 10 -', 'In Goncalves, 941 A.2d at 848, we first addressed the issue of sentence re-bundling and held that “a hearing justice who corrects an illegal sentence pursuant to Rule 35(a) may correct the entire initial sentencing package to preserve the originally intended sentencing scheme, so long as the corrected sentence does not exceed the sentence originally imposed.” We recently reaffirmed this holding in Bouffard, 35 A.3d at 917.', 'In the case before us, the trial justice ably followed our pronouncements on sentence re- bundling. The trial justice‟s recalibration of the sentence that was executed in 2004 preserved his original sentencing scheme—to execute five years of the fifteen-year suspended sentence, with the remaining ten years suspended—and did not exceed the original sentence. The same can be said for the trial justice‟s correction of the sentence he executed after he adjudged defendant a probation violator yet again, in 2009. We are of the opinion that the trial justice acted well within his discretion in determining what portion of defendant‟s suspended sentence should be executed and what portion should remain suspended.', 'Finally, defendant argues that his due process rights were violated when he was sentenced as a probation violator in 2009; he contends that after completing his five-year prison term, he no longer was on probation because only the illegal ten-year stayed sentence remained at that point. We deem this argument unavailing for several reasons.', 'As a threshold matter, defendant failed to raise this issue in 2009, when he admitted that he was a violator. The proper method of challenging the state‟s Rule 32(f) notice of violation would have been a motion to dismiss at the probation-revocation hearing, not a Rule 35 motion after a sentence was executed upon the finding of probation violation. See State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 339 (R.I. 1997) (the defendant moved to dismiss the state‟s Rule 32(f) notice of probation violation, contending that his probationary term had not begun at the time of the', '- 11 - alleged violation).', 'Therefore, we are convinced that defendant has failed to preserve any argument that he could not have been presented as a probation violator in 2009.', 'Moreover, if the defendant‟s due process contention had been preserved, we nonetheless would conclude that it has no merit. The defendant‟s argument that he did not believe he was on probation after completing the five-year incarcerative term that was executed in 2004 is belied by the papers he signed when he was released from prison, in which he acknowledged the conditions of his probation. Thus, despite his present assertions to the contrary, the defendant had notice that he was on probation after he was released from prison.', 'Therefore, the defendant‟s due process contention must fail.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

85,Joseph Jolly : v. : A.T. Wall.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court.', 'Joseph Jolly (Jolly or applicant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment dismissing his application for postconviction relief. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 6, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In February 2008, Jolly was charged by indictment with three counts of second-degree child molestation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3 and one count of first-degree child molestation in violation of § 11-37-8.1. On April 2, 2009, Jolly appeared before a justice of the Superior Court to enter pleas of nolo contendere to the three counts of second-degree child molestation. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the charge of first-degree child molestation was dismissed under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-1-', 'The transcript of the plea hearing, which was entered into evidence at Jolly’s postconviction-relief hearing, reveals that the hearing justice engaged in a thorough colloquy with Jolly before he accepted the plea. 1 Among other things, the hearing justice asked Jolly whether he was “under the influence of any substance” at that time. (Emphasis added.) Jolly replied that he was not. Jolly also confirmed that he had discussed his plea affidavit with his attorney. After reviewing the various rights that Jolly would be waiving by pleading to the charges, the hearing justice asked the prosecutor to review the facts underlying those charges. Jolly confirmed that the facts as recited by the prosecutor were correct.', 'The hearing justice then found that Jolly was “acting freely and voluntarily in entering his nolo plea” and was “fully cognizant of * * * the consequences of that plea and corresponding waiver of his constitutional rights.” He also indicated that he was “satisfied * * * that there [was] a factual basis for the plea or pleas as to each count.” After the hearing justice accepted Jolly’s plea, he imposed a sentence of twenty years imprisonment, with five years to serve and fifteen years suspended, with probation.', 'Approximately five months later, on September 11, 2009, Jolly filed an application for postconviction relief. In that filing, Jolly claimed that his conviction should be vacated because (1) his plea was involuntary and (2) he had been denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. As grounds for his assertion that the plea was involuntary, the petition alleged that Jolly was under the influence of prescription medication during the plea hearing. As grounds for his claim that he had been deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel, the petition alleged that Jolly’s attorney had forced him to plead to the charges and had advised him not to tell the court about the medication he had taken that day. 1', 'Although the title page of the transcript is incorrectly dated April 2, 2008, the first page indicates the correct date.', '-2-', 'A hearing on Jolly’s application for postconviction relief was held over the course of five days during January and February of 2010. The same justice who had accepted Jolly’s plea of nolo contendere (less than one year earlier) presided over the postconviction-relief hearing. Five witnesses testified at that hearing: Jolly; his mother-in-law, Beverly Mortimore; his wife, Beverly Jolly; his sister-in-law, Belinda Braga; and his sister, Carol Stanton.', 'Jolly testified that he retained his attorney soon after police contacted him regarding allegations of child molestation. Later, after Jolly was indicted, he told his attorney that he was not guilty and wanted to go to trial on the charges. Jolly paid his attorney a substantial sum of money with the understanding that this fee was required to take the case to trial. Jolly averred that his attorney initially told him that he believed he was innocent and that the complaining witness was lying.', 'According to Jolly, in February or March of 2009, his attorney’s attitude about the case “completely changed,” and he told Jolly that he “should start thinking about taking a plea.” Jolly testified that his attorney told him that he had “lost to the judge” and that Jolly “didn’t exactly know what it meant.” 2 At first, when his attorney told Jolly that he should consider taking a plea, Jolly told him that “this [wasn’t] right” and that he was innocent. At some point, however, Jolly told his attorney that he would consider taking a plea. Jolly testified that he came to this decision after his attorney told him that, if he did not take a plea, he might not see his young daughter growing up. 3 2', 'The docket sheet for the underlying charges against Jolly reveals that his motion to suppress evidence was denied in February 2009. 3', 'On cross-examination, Jolly explained that his daughter was about nine months old in April 2009. As we note below, Jolly faced potentially severe penalties if convicted of first-degree child molestation.', '-3-', 'Jolly testified that he had another change of heart the night before his plea hearing took place. That night, Jolly called his attorney and left a message on his answering machine, stating that he “wasn’t going to take the plea.” When his attorney called him back, Jolly did not want to answer. Jolly’s attorney then called Jolly’s wife on her phone and asked to speak with Jolly. Jolly testified that he spoke with his attorney for “well over an hour” that night regarding whether he should take a plea. 4', 'The next day, on April 2, 2009, Jolly went to court for the plea hearing. That morning, Jolly took several different prescription medications. One of those medications was lorazepam, which Jolly was supposed to take three times a day as needed for anxiety. 5 When Jolly woke up that morning, he took one lorazepam pill. He took another one on the way to the courthouse and a third pill when he arrived at the courthouse. Before Jolly and his relatives went to lunch, he met briefly with his attorney. Jolly told him that he did not want to take the plea and that he “had to take a lot of meds just to do this.” According to Jolly, his attorney advised him not to tell the court about taking those medications and that he “had to be convincing.” He said that his attorney continued to pressure him to take a plea.', 'Immediately before the hearing, which was in the afternoon, Jolly took three more lorazepam pills. Jolly recalled that, after consuming six lorazepam pills in total, he felt “out of it” and “kind of relaxed.” When asked on direct examination why he took so many pills that day, 4', 'Mrs. Jolly’s phone records were admitted into evidence as proof that these telephone calls had occurred. The phone records and her testimony revealed that these conversations took place not on the eve of the plea hearing, as Jolly had recalled, but two nights before the plea hearing. This inconsistency is immaterial to our decision. 5', 'Although Jolly testified that he was supposed to take lorazepam “three times a day or as needed,” records admitted into evidence at the postconviction-relief hearing indicate that the drug was to be taken “three times a day as needed.” (Emphasis added.)', '-4- Jolly testified that he did so because he was innocent and did not want to plead to the charges. Jolly averred that he took his medications with him to the hearing, at his attorney’s direction.', 'Following what he said was his attorney’s advice, when the hearing justice asked Jolly whether he was under the influence of any substance, he did not mention the medications he had taken. Jolly recalled—and the transcript of the plea hearing confirms—that, at the conclusion of the hearing, his attorney mentioned to the hearing justice that Jolly had a medical condition involving blood clots in his lungs.', 'The hearing justice confirmed that a list of Jolly’s medications would accompany him to prison and ordered him medically assessed upon entry.', 'Jolly was cross-examined extensively on several topics, including: his medications; his relationship with his attorney; his prior charges and convictions; 6 the plea hearing; and his efforts toward postconviction relief. When the prosecutor asked Jolly if he “knew what it meant” to plead nolo contendere when he did so on April 2, 2009, he admitted that he did know what it meant, but claimed that his attorney had forced him to enter the plea.', 'Four of Jolly’s relatives also testified at the postconviction-relief hearing. Each of these witnesses recounted, from her perspective, the events that Jolly had described. Their testimony was more or less consistent with his version of those events. Because Carol Stanton did not attend Jolly’s plea hearing (unlike his other relatives), she did not testify about that day’s events.', 'The state presented no witnesses at the postconviction-relief hearing. On February 25, 2010, the hearing justice denied Jolly’s application for postconviction relief.', 'In a bench decision, he explained that “based on [his] view of the testimony and the evidence presented, the 6', 'April 2009 was the fourth occasion on which Jolly entered a plea of nolo contendere to criminal charges. He had previously pled nolo contendere to (1) a charge of domestic disorderly conduct, in February 2007; (2) two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of malicious destruction of property, in September 1989; and (3) a charge of driving while intoxicated, in May 1989.', '-5- ineffective [assistance of] counsel claim really boils down to a reiteration of the prior claim [regarding the voluntariness of Jolly’s plea] * * *.” He found that “no evidence [had] been presented” that would support another basis for Jolly’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'As for whether Jolly’s plea was voluntarily entered, the hearing justice noted that he had reviewed the transcript of the plea hearing and also had an “independent recollection” of that proceeding. He recalled “nothing unusual about Mr. Jolly’s condition at the time [of the plea hearing].” The hearing justice credited Jolly’s testimony that he had decided to plead to the charges in March 2009. Although he “[did not] doubt that between [March 2009] and the date the actual plea was entered * * * Mr. Jolly vacillated” about this decision, the hearing justice found that, “when [Jolly] came to court on April 2, [2009,] he had made up his mind [to plead to the charges].”', 'The hearing justice found that, although Jolly’s attorney had been “quite assertive” in advising Jolly to plead to the charges, Jolly’s decision to do so was nonetheless his own voluntary choice. Finally, the hearing justice observed that, if Jolly had been found guilty at trial, he would have faced severe penalties, including a possible life sentence on the charge of first-degree child molestation.', 'An order entered on May 4, 2010, which effectuated the hearing justice’s decision. Thereafter, Jolly timely appealed to this Court. 7 7', 'Jolly filed, pro se, a second application for postconviction relief in Superior Court in February 2011. On May 5, 2011, the same justice who had presided over the hearing on his first postconviction-relief application determined that Jolly’s second application was premature. Jolly appealed that decision to this Court via a writ of mandamus. We denied Jolly’s mandamus petition by order on October 11, 2012. Jolly’s second application for postconviction relief is not at issue here.', '-6-', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Jolly argues that the hearing justice erred in dismissing his application for postconviction relief. First, Jolly asserts that he did not voluntarily plead to the charges. Second, he contends that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in either (1) coercing him to plead to the charges or (2) advising him to tell the hearing justice that he was not under the influence of any substance, even though Jolly’s attorney knew that he had taken prescription medication before the plea hearing. Jolly also suggests that the hearing justice should have drawn an adverse inference against the state from its failure to call his plea attorney to testify at the postconviction-relief hearing. We discuss these issues in turn.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Rhode Island’s statutory postconviction remedy is set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10.', '“An applicant * * * for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted.” Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 601 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 901 n.7 (R.I. 2008)). “[I]n the case of someone who has entered a plea of nolo contendere, ‘[t]he sole focus of an application for post- conviction relief * * * is the nature of counsel’s advice concerning the plea and the voluntariness of the plea.’” Guerrero v. State, 47 A.3d 289, 300 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 87 (R.I. 2007)).', 'In reviewing an application for postconviction relief, “[t]his Court will not impinge upon the fact-finding function of a hearing justice * * * ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.’”', '-7- Anderson, 45 A.3d at 601 (quoting Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011)). We employ a de novo standard of review with regard to “questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights * * *.” Id. (quoting State v. Laurence, 18 A.3d 512, 521 (R.I. 2011)). Even when applying the de novo standard of review to such issues, however, “we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference * * *.” Id. (quoting Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 16 (R.I. 2012)).', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Voluntariness of Jolly’s Plea and Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'Because Jolly’s arguments concerning the voluntariness of his plea and his attorney’s performance are interwoven, we analyze them in tandem. At the postconviction-relief hearing, Jolly bore the burden of proving “that, but for his attorney’s errors, he would not have entered a [nolo contendere] plea, but rather would have proceeded to trial.” Gonder, 935 A.2d at 87. We discern no error in the hearing justice’s conclusion that Jolly “ha[d] not sustained his burden of proof.” The hearing justice noted that his decision was based both “on [his] review of [the] transcript [of the April 2, 2009 hearing], and * * * also on [his] independent recollection of the proceedings [at that hearing].” In our view, the colloquy at the plea hearing supports the hearing justice’s finding that Jolly entered his plea voluntarily and without undue force or coercion from his attorney or any other source. Jolly informed the hearing justice that he had earned a GED', '-8- and denied that he was under the influence of any substance. 8 He confirmed that he had reviewed the plea agreement with his attorney and averred that there was nothing he did not understand about it. 9 The record reflects no uncertainty, apprehension, or wavering on Jolly’s part during the plea hearing. As this appeal shows, Jolly now apparently regrets his decision to plead to the charges. However, we conclude that on the critical day of April 2, 2009, he did so voluntarily.', 'We also agree with the hearing justice’s finding that Jolly’s attorney did not render ineffective assistance of counsel in pressuring him to plead to the charges.', 'As we have recognized, “a court’s examination of counsel’s performance should be highly deferential.” Moniz v. State, 933 A.2d 691, 696 (R.I. 2007) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984)). Given that Jolly faced the possibility of a life sentence if convicted on the charge of first-degree child molestation and given that Jolly’s motion to suppress evidence was unsuccessful, we cannot say that the hearing justice erred in finding that Jolly’s counsel gave him sound advice to plead to the charges.', 'As to Jolly’s assertion that his attorney should have advised him to inform the court that he had ingested prescription medication before the plea hearing, the hearing justice (who later presided over the postconviction-relief hearing) noticed nothing unusual about Jolly’s physical or mental condition that day.', 'Jolly’s attorney was well aware that his client took various 8', 'The better practice may be for the court to specifically inquire whether a defendant has taken “any drugs, alcohol or medication” before the plea hearing, as did the hearing justice in Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 86 (R.I. 2007). Phrasing the question this way would not only limit a defendant’s ability to collaterally attack his or her conviction, but would also serve to ensure that a hearing justice is made aware of any substance that could conceivably affect a defendant’s ability to enter a plea voluntarily. We emphasize, however, that we discern no error in the hearing justice’s conclusions regarding Jolly’s plea in this matter. 9', 'As we observe in note 6, supra, this was the fourth occasion on which Jolly pled nolo contendere to criminal charges.', '-9- prescription medications. Before the plea hearing concluded, at the request of Jolly’s attorney, the hearing justice ordered that a list of Jolly’s prescription medications accompany him to prison. Jolly admitted that he had helped prepare this list, which his wife gave to his attorney for submission to the court.', 'We will not presume that Jolly’s attorney advised his client to lie to the hearing justice about his medications, and we discredit Jolly’s assertion that his attorney did so. See Moniz, 933 A.2d at 696. It would have made no sense for Jolly’s attorney to attempt to conceal his client’s intake of prescription medication, given that he later submitted a list of Jolly’s prescriptions to the court. The actions of Jolly’s attorney were “reasonable considering all the circumstances.” Id. (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688).', '“[I]t is well settled that a claim of ineffective assistance [of counsel] requires an applicant for postconviction relief to prove that the result of the proceeding would have been different were it not for the performance of his [or her] attorney.” Hassett v. State, 899 A.2d 430, 437 (R.I. 2006). Because Jolly has failed to carry his burden of proof on this issue, we hold that the hearing justice correctly rejected his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'B', 'State’s Failure to Produce Jolly’s Attorney at the Postconviction-Relief Hearing', 'Finally, Jolly contends that the hearing justice should have drawn an adverse inference against the state based on its failure to call upon Jolly’s plea attorney to testify at the postconviction-relief hearing. The state suggests that Jolly waived this argument since he did not raise it below. Jolly’s postconviction counsel did not specifically urge the hearing justice to draw an adverse inference against the state based upon its failure to call Jolly’s attorney as a witness, but she did point out that the state offered no evidence to controvert the testimony of', '- 10 - Jolly and his relatives. Although we conclude that Jolly has preserved this argument for our review, we hold that it is meritless.', '“[A] litigant’s unexplained failure to produce an available witness who would be expected to give material testimony in [sic] the litigant’s behalf permits, but does not compel, a factfinder to draw an inference that had the witness testified, the testimony would have been adverse to the litigant.” Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 294 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Belanger v. Cross, 488 A.2d 410, 412- 13 (R.I. 1985)). Under this rule, the hearing justice could have chosen to draw an adverse inference against the state for its failure to call Jolly’s attorney (assuming arguendo that he was available), but he was under no obligation to draw such an inference. Furthermore, because Jolly’s attorney was “equally accessible to both parties, no inference can spring from the failure of either party to call [him].” State v. Rogers, 687 A.2d 1242, 1243 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Avarista v. Aloisio, 672 A.2d 887, 892 (R.I. 1996)).', 'As the party who bore the burden of proof on his postconviction-relief application, Jolly cannot fault the state for choosing not to call his attorney to testify at the hearing. We discern no error in the hearing justice’s conclusions on the issues presented, and we reject Jolly’s argument on this point.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 11 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Joseph Jolly v.

Breggia.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted to this Court on behalf of the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment and vacate the entry of final judgment.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'It is undisputed that, on October 18, 2006, a motor vehicle collision involving Mr. DeMaio and Mr. Ciccone occurred on Hartford Avenue in Johnston. At the time of the collision, Mr. DeMaio was riding his motorcycle and Mr. Ciccone was driving a 1995 Volkswagen Jetta that belonged to his girlfriend, co-defendant Cheryl Breggia. On June 18, 2007, Mr. DeMaio and his wife, Linda,1 filed a complaint naming Mr. Ciccone and Ms. Breggia2 as defendants. The complaint alleged that Mr. Ciccone had been negligently operating the Jetta at the time of the collision.', 'The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on June 25, 2010.', 'In their accompanying memorandum of law, defendants contended that the evidence “established that the plaintiff’s motorcycle struck the rear of the defendants’ motor vehicle.” Under Rhode Island law, “[w]hen a case includes a claim or defense resulting from a rear-end collision between vehicles, a prima facie case of negligence against the driver of the car in the rear is established * * *.” Maglioli v. J.P. Noonan Transportation, Inc., 869 A.2d 71, 75 (R.I. 2005). The defendants argued that the court should grant summary judgment in their favor because Mr. DeMaio was unable to rebut the prima facie evidence of his own negligence, which prima facie evidence arose from the fact of the rear-end collision. 1', 'It appears that Linda DeMaio’s claims are for loss of consortium resulting from the injuries suffered by her husband. See, e.g., Olshansky v. Rehrig International, 872 A.2d 282, 291 (R.I. 2005). 2', 'Cheryl Breggia was not in her Jetta at the time of the accident. However, under Rhode Island law, the owner of a vehicle may be liable for the acts of another person who operates the owner’s car “with the consent of the owner.” G.L. 1956 § 31-33-6; see generally Pichardo v. Stevens, 55 A.3d 762 (R.I. 2012).', '-2-', 'None of the parties identified any witnesses to the collision; accordingly, the motion justice was presented with the conflicting stories of the two motor vehicle operators along with the deposition testimony of Sgt. Christopher Correia (the investigating officer) as well as a police report concerning the collision and police photographs of the scene. At the conclusion of a hearing on November 9, 2010, the motion justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, stating that Mr. DeMaio had “struck * * * the Ciccone vehicle from the rear.” The motion justice further stated that, “to rebut the presumption that he was negligent, Mr. DeMaio needs more than just some speculation” regarding Mr. Ciccone’s negligence. We shall next proceed to outline in greater detail the evidence presented to the motion justice.', 'A', 'Mr. DeMaio’s Version of the Events', 'This section of the opinion sets forth pertinent details regarding the night of the collision as provided by Mr. DeMaio in his deposition testimony and in his answers to interrogatories.', 'Mr. DeMaio testified that he had been “driving bikes for 35 years”3 and had been involved in only one accident prior to the collision in October of 2006; he thought that the earlier accident had occurred “in the Seventies.”', 'Mr. DeMaio stated that, whenever he rode his motorcycle, “especially at nighttime, [he was] always glancing around.”', 'Mr. DeMaio further testified that, at approximately 8 p.m. on the night of the collision, he was on his motorcycle heading East on Hartford Avenue. He stated that he was traveling “30, 35 miles an hour” down a straight section of the road with his lights on. He recalled that there was no traffic in the area, and he added that he would have been “looking in the mirrors and checking 3', 'The word “bike” can properly be used to refer to a motorcycle as well as a bicycle and a motorbike. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 179 (5th ed. 2011). It is clear from the context of his deposition testimony that, when Mr. DeMaio stated that he had been “driving bikes for 35 years,” he was referring to his use of motorcycles.', '-3- everything” so as to survey the road. When asked at his deposition what was “the last thing that [he] remember[ed] before the accident,” Mr. DeMaio replied:', '“No one near me, I’m coming down Route 6 going maybe 35 miles', 'an hour, that’s the last thing I remember. So I don’t know where', 'Mr. Ciccone came out from. I’d like to know, but I have no idea.', 'He said that supposedly, my wife told me, that he came out, I', 'followed him and banged into him. I would have remembered', 'that. I’ve been driving bikes for 35 years, I definitely would have', 'remembered that.”', 'Mr. DeMaio testified that his first memory after losing consciousness consisted of “waking up in the rescue” briefly; his next memory was of waking up again at the Trauma Center in Rhode Island Hospital, where “a young doctor * * * was sewing [his] ear.”', 'Regarding the damage to his motorcycle, Mr. DeMaio stated that “the heavier damage was all on the right-hand side,” noting that “[e]verything was crushed in, the crash bar, the tank, the chrome, the peg was bent up, the foot pegs, and * * * the right front fender was damaged.” Mr. DeMaio further testified that the man who removed the motorcycle from the scene of the collision “said that it looked like the impact was on the right-hand side” of the motorcycle.', 'B', 'Mr. Ciccone’s Version of the Events', 'At his deposition, Mr. Ciccone painted a different picture of the events on the night of the collision. He testified that he had been at Ms. Breggia’s home and then, “right around supper,” he took her car to go to the store. He stated that, while on his way there, he came to the intersection of Harding Avenue and Hartford Avenue. He said that, at that time, he stopped for about five seconds and saw a motorcycle heading East on Hartford Avenue towards the intersection. Mr. Ciccone testified that the motorcycle was the only vehicle that he saw on Hartford Avenue at that time.', '-4-', 'Mr. Ciccone testified that he then turned East onto Hartford Avenue so that Mr. DeMaio’s motorcycle was “over 200 yards, and maybe more” behind him and traveling in the same direction. He estimated that he traveled for about thirty seconds before he reached the entrance to the convenience store that was his destination. Mr. Ciccone stated that he then “[came] to a complete stop * * * [on Hartford Avenue] because there’s usually cars at the convenience store, so you [have] to take a look before you turn in.” He testified that, after stopping, he started to turn right so that the Jetta was “slightly” at an angle, with the nose of the car in the parking lot. Mr. Ciccone maintained that, at that moment, Mr. DeMaio’s motorcycle struck the Jetta from behind.', 'Regarding the resulting damage to the Jetta, Mr. Ciccone testified as follows:', '“The back left-hand side was hit, and I guess the bike kind of', 'wrapped a little bit and the back left rear on the side was hit—not', 'hit, it was like scraped on the side, but in the back was the—where', 'the impact was. On the side it was pushed a little bit in and', 'scraped on the back left rear, back left side was scraped too.”', 'C', 'Sergeant Correia’s Deposition and the Police Report', 'Christopher Correia, a sergeant in the Johnston Police Department who responded to the collision, was also deposed in connection with this case. Sergeant Correia testified that he carried out an investigation of the collision on the night of the incident. Sergeant Correia stated that neither he nor any of the other responding officers were certified accident reconstructionists. Unlike a “full accident reconstruction,” Sgt. Correia testified that the type of investigation he performed would have been based on the “position of the vehicles or vehicle, the operators, what they may have to say, location of damage on the vehicles that could indicate position or where they were traveling from, any time from operators, independent witnesses, those kind[s] of things to try to simulate that and put it all together.”', '-5-', 'Sergeant Correia did not interview Mr. DeMaio on the night of the collision because, before an emergency vehicle came to take Mr. DeMaio to the hospital, he “was down and not in condition to speak to.” Sergeant Correia added that he did not want to “push” Mr. DeMaio due to the fact that he had “head injuries and [was] bleeding in the middle of the roadway.” However, Sgt. Correia testified that he did interview Mr. Ciccone, who told him that “he was struck in the rear by the motorcycle.”', 'After referring to his police report during his deposition, Sgt. Correia testified that “[i]t appears that the motorcycle was also traveling eastbound behind the vehicle, wasn’t able to stop and—based on the damage being at that driver’s back corner of the vehicle, tried to swerve around and possibly caught the rear corner of the vehicle.” He testified that “on the right side of the [motorcycle] there was red paint transfer across the gas tank as well as the front suspension forks.” Sergeant Correia also identified photographs that were taken at the scene of the accident by a fellow police officer.', 'The deposition of Sgt. Correia included the following exchange between Mr. DeMaio’s attorney and the police officer:', 'Q: “Based on your years of investigating accidents, if Mr. Ciccone', 'had turned out of that side street in front of [Mr. DeMaio’s] bike,', 'would the damage have been to the same parts of his bike and Mr.', 'Ciccone’s vehicle?”', 'A: “It depends. It depends on the angle of when he pulled out at', 'the time. It’s possible that it could have been in the same spot, it’s', 'possible that it could have been in a different spot.”', '-6-', 'D', 'The Photographs', 'As part of their objection to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs presented to the motion justice several photographs taken by the police on the night of the collision, including the photograph that is attached as Appendix A to this decision.', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'On appeal, Mr. and Mrs. DeMaio contend that they presented evidence tending to show that Mr. Ciccone was negligent and that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the October 18, 2006 incident was in actuality a rear-end collision. The plaintiffs therefore argue that summary judgment was improperly granted in defendants’ favor.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews the granting of a motion for summary judgment in a de novo manner. Jessup & Conroy, P.C. v. Seguin, 46 A.3d 835, 838 (R.I. 2012). We apply the same standards used by the motion justice. Papudesu v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island, 18 A.3d 495, 497 (R.I. 2011). We will affirm the grant of summary judgment only “[i]f we conclude, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be decided and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law * * *.” Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 372 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We are ever mindful that “[s]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d', '-7- 386, 390 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The motion justice “must refrain from weighing the evidence or passing upon issues of credibility.” Doe v. Gelineau, 732 A.2d 43, 48 (R.I. 1999). Ultimately, the “purpose of the summary judgment procedure is issue finding, not issue determination.” Estate of Giuliano, 949 A.2d at 391 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'It should also be borne in mind that this Court has recognized that “issues of negligence are ordinarily not susceptible of summary adjudication, but should be resolved by trial in the ordinary manner.” See Gliottone v. Ethier, 870 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2005) (collecting cases) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DeNardo v. Fairmount Foundries Cranston, Inc., 121 R.I. 440, 448, 399 A.2d 1229, 1234 (1979) (“In Rhode Island the general rule is that negligence is a question for the jury unless the facts warrant only one conclusion.”). The motion justice may treat the issue of negligence as a matter of law only if the “facts suggest only one reasonable inference.” See Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc., 119 R.I. 70, 77, 376 A.2d 329, 333 (1977).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'Applying the just-summarized principles to the facts of this case, it is our opinion that summary judgment should not have been granted.', 'It is true that this Court has long recognized that the fact of a rear-end collision constitutes “prima facie evidence of [the] negligence of the driver of the second vehicle.” See Barnes v. Quality Beef Co., 425 A.2d 531, 536 (R.I. 1981). Mr. Ciccone contends that he was “rear-ended” by Mr. DeMaio’s motorcycle; on that basis, he argues that the evidence points to but one conclusion—viz., that the plaintiff driver (Mr. DeMaio) was the only negligent party and that, therefore, the defendant driver (Mr. Ciccone) cannot be liable. We disagree. In order to be', '-8- able to benefit from the prima facie evidence, the party seeking to employ that evidentiary principle must first establish that the motor vehicle collision was, in fact, a rear-end collision. See Rachiele v. McGovern, 107 R.I. 241, 245, 266 A.2d 36, 38 (1970) (noting that the prima facie evidence principle applies “where a rear-end collision is established” (emphasis added)). Moreover, since the motion justice decided the issue of whether there was a rear-end collision in the context of a summary judgment motion, he was required to make that determination while “viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to” plaintiffs. Delta Airlines, Inc. v. Neary, 785 A.2d 1123, 1126 (R.I. 2001).', 'The defendants certainly produced some evidence tending to show that the accident was a rear-end collision: Mr. Ciccone testified that the motorcycle struck the “back left rear” of the Jetta; and the police report that was presented to the motion justice states that the car “sustained damage to the rear, rear tail light, and rear driver’s fender,” and it further notes that such damage was “consistent with [Mr. Ciccone’s] statement that he was rear ended.” In addition, Sgt. Correia testified that, based on his investigation on the night of the collision, it “appear[ed] * * * [that Mr. DeMaio] tried to swerve around and possibly caught the rear corner of the vehicle.”', 'Notably and critical to our decision, however, plaintiffs presented conflicting evidence which, if believed, would certainly create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the accident was in actuality a rear-end collision. Mr. DeMaio testified that, before the collision took place, he had been riding his motorcycle on a straight section of road without any vehicles in front of him. That testimony stands in stark contrast with the testimony of Mr. Ciccone, who presented a version of the events where Mr. DeMaio would have been riding behind the Jetta before the collision on Hartford Avenue; in fact, if Mr. Ciccone’s version is correct, the rear-end', '-9- of the Jetta would have been directly in Mr. DeMaio’s line of sight for thirty seconds before the impact.', 'For the motion justice to conclude that Mr. DeMaio rear-ended the Jetta, he would have had to either disregard Mr. DeMaio’s testimony or deem it not worthy of belief. However, summary judgment is not the moment for the court to make credibility assessments—a function that should be reserved for the fact-finder at trial. Gelineau, 732 A.2d at 48; see also Pichardo v. Stevens, 55 A.3d 762, 766 (R.I. 2012); Estate of Giuliano, 949 A.2d at 394 n.9.', 'It should also be noted that plaintiffs, as the nonmoving parties, directed the motion justice’s attention to the photographs of the vehicle that were taken after the collision on Hartford Avenue. Although those photographs depict damage to the rear left fender and rear left taillight of the Jetta, they also reveal considerable damage to the left side of the car. Significantly, the only indentations appear to be on that side of the vehicle. Further, while the police report indicates that the damage may have been consistent with a rear-end collision, there are other reasonable conclusions that a jury could reach given the facts presented to the motion justice; in fact, Sgt. Correia admitted in his deposition testimony that the damage to the motorcycle and the Jetta could also be consistent with Mr. Ciccone’s having hit the motorcycle while pulling out onto Hartford Avenue. Given such conflicting evidence, the motion justice should not have granted summary judgment based on his conclusion that the accident was a rear- end collision.', 'In our view, not only does this evidence call into question whether the accident was a rear-end collision, but it also creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding which operator was negligent. This Court addressed a similar situation in Gliottone. In that case, the plaintiff brought a negligence action after his car was involved in a collision with the defendant’s vehicle.', '- 10 - See Gliottone, 870 A.2d at 1023. The plaintiff was traveling northbound when he began a left- hand turn into a service station; at that point, the defendant’s car (traveling southbound) collided with the plaintiff’s vehicle. See id. The plaintiff had no recollection of the collision other than having seen a “white blur” just before his head hit the windshield. See id. The plaintiff testified that he never saw the defendant’s vehicle, nor could he remember whether he was braking or accelerating at the time of the crash. Id. at 1024. Only one eyewitness was deposed; she testified (1) that the plaintiff did not use his directional signal, (2) that the defendant was traveling between twenty-five and twenty-eight miles per hour at the time of the collision, and (3) that the “plaintiff crossed into oncoming traffic so suddenly that defendant could not have avoided the accident.” Id. The evidence also included photographs of the damage to the vehicles. Id.', 'The defendant in the Gliottone case filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the “plaintiff had failed during discovery to raise evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether [the] defendant’s negligence had caused the collision.” Gliottone, 870 A.2d at 1024. The hearing justice granted summary judgment in the defendant’s favor, but this Court reversed the decision on appeal. See id. at 1029. We stated that, “[a]lthough the evidence of plaintiff’s negligence * * * [was] very strong * * * the photographs illustrate such significant and severe front-end damage to [the plaintiff’s] vehicle that a jury reasonably could infer that [the] defendant may have been speeding at the time of the accident.” Id. at 1028.', 'Similarly, with respect to the case at bar, the photographs from the scene of the collision on Hartford Avenue reveal enough damage to the side of the Jetta that a jury reasonably could infer that Mr. DeMaio’s motorcycle struck the side of the Jetta after Mr. Ciccone had negligently pulled out in front of the motorcycle. While Sgt. Correia’s report notes that the damage was', '- 11 - consistent with a rear-end collision, that report was composed without the benefit of Mr. DeMaio’s statements concerning his perception of what transpired on the night of October 18, 2006.', 'Mr. Ciccone asserts that he was struck from behind, but the photographs show indentations on the side of the Jetta; and Sgt. Correia testified that it is possible that this damage could have been caused by Mr. Ciccone’s having pulled out in front of Mr. DeMaio’s motorcycle. That scenario would also be consistent with Mr. DeMaio’s testimony that, before he lost consciousness, he had been traveling at a moderate speed down a straight road without anyone in front of him.', 'Both scenarios are factually plausible. Accordingly, the summary judgment inquiry is at an end: “when the facts support plausible but conflicting inferences on a pivotal issue in the case, the judge may not choose between those inferences at the summary judgment stage.” See Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Estate of Giuliano, 949 A.2d at 394 n.9 (“The weight of the evidence should not be evaluated at the summary judgment stage.”). It is our opinion that there is sufficient conflicting evidence on the issue of negligence for this case to be submitted to a fact-finder. See Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009) (“It is well settled that issues of negligence are ordinarily not susceptible of summary adjudication, but should be resolved by trial in the ordinary manner.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and vacate the entry of final judgment.

87,": v. : Nope’s Island Conservation Association, : Inc.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The southern coast of Rhode Island, including beachfront areas of Charlestown and Westerly, can be spectacular places of beauty and tranquility. Unfortunately, relations among the people who love those places, even among those who endeavor to preserve them in their pristine condition, are not always so tranquil. The defendant, Nope’s Island Conservation Association (defendant or NICA), appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court that recognized a prescriptive easement over property that it owns in Charlestown, Rhode Island. After a bench trial, the trial justice found that the easement runs from a pathway, commonly known locally as the “sand trail,” over the defendant’s land, to assessor’s plat No. 1, lot No. 82 (lot No. 82), which is owned by the plaintiff, Rhode Island Mobile Sportfishermen, Inc. (plaintiff or RIMS). On appeal before this Court, the defendant argues (1) that the plaintiff was barred by G.L. 1956 § 34-7-9 1 from claiming a prescriptive easement over this land because it was held for conservation purposes, (2) that the “relation- 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-7-9 says that “[a]ny land held or preserved by a nonprofit corporation or nonprofit association for purposes of conservation, open space, or a cemetery is not subject to adverse possession or prescription.”', '-1- back” doctrine founded in Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure does not protect the plaintiff from the strictures of this statute, and (3) that even if the plaintiff was not barred from bringing such a claim, it nonetheless failed to prove the elements for a prescriptive easement by the requisite proof. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this case to that tribunal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant is a nonprofit conservation corporation that owns beachfront property on Quonochontaug Beach (the beach) in Westerly and Charlestown. The beach is located on a peninsula that is situated between the Atlantic Ocean to its south and Quonochontaug Pond (the pond) to its north. 2 The defendant owns all the beachfront property on the southern side of the peninsula in Charlestown. The plaintiff owns lot No. 82, which is on the northern side of that same peninsula and is situated between the pond to its north and defendant’s land (lot No. 81) to its south. In the past, but at times that are relevant to this appeal, a shallow, saltwater creek ran through the southern portion of lot No. 82, between the sand trail and the northern portion of the lot. As a result of ocean storms and the changing geography of oceanfront land, the creek has since filled due to “wash over.”', 'The sand trail provides the only land access to the peninsula; it runs directly across defendant’s property from west to east. However, the sand trail does not abut lot No. 82 and, as a result, there is a strip of land of varying width, ranging from ten to forty feet, between lot No. 82 and the sand trail. Therefore, to get to lot No. 82 from the sand trail, plaintiff’s members 2', 'A map of the peninsula is attached to this opinion.', '-2- must travel over a small segment of lot No. 81. It is plaintiff’s right to travel over that small piece of land that is disputed in this case. 3', 'A', 'Background and Travel', 'In 1929, Colby and Annette Crandall purchased lot No. 82, and their son, John Crandall, acquired the property by inheritance in 1983. Then, in 1999, John Crandall conveyed lot No. 82 to plaintiff. 4 The defendant, on the other hand, acquired lot No. 81 in 1952. 5', 'On June 4, 2000, perhaps aware of increasing activity on and around its property, NICA sent a notice of intention to dispute plaintiff’s right to travel over its land in accordance with § 34-7-6. 6 In response to that notice, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court, on July 20, 3', 'At present, NICA permits beachgoers to walk on and across its property. It does not, however, allow motor vehicles to be parked on the sand trail. Therefore, for plaintiff’s members to get to and use lot No. 82, in the absence of an easement, it would be necessary for them to walk two miles across the peninsula, to be driven by someone else to their land, or to get access to the lot by boat. 4', 'The plaintiff also owns assessor’s plat No. 1, lot No. 75 (lot No. 75), which is farther east on the peninsula. As the owner of lot No. 75, plaintiff has the right to travel the sand trail over lot No. 81. 5', 'Lot No. 81 was acquired in 1952 by Nope’s Island Association, Inc., described by defendant as its “predecessor.” It appears that defendant retained title to the property when it was incorporated in its present form in 1991. 6', 'Section 34-7-6 provides:', '“Whenever the legal owner of any lands anticipates that', 'any other person or persons may obtain the title to those lands, or', 'any way, easement or privilege therein, by possession under the', 'provisions of this chapter, he or she may give notice in writing to', 'the person claiming or using the lands, way, easement, or privilege,', 'of his or her intention to dispute any right arising from that claim', 'or use; and the notice, served and recorded as hereinafter provided,', 'shall be deemed an interruption of the use and prevent the', 'acquiring of any right thereto by the continuance of the use for any', 'length of time thereafter.

Approximately ten years later, and after only minimal discovery had been conducted, RIMS amended its complaint, detailing in the amended complaint the manner in which the Crandall family had satisfied each element of an easement by prescription. 8 RIMS further asserted in the amended complaint that, by virtue of G.L. 1956 § 34- 11-28, 9 the right to cross over lot No. 81 passed to RIMS when it acquired lot No. 82 by deed from John Crandall.', 'In its answer to plaintiff’s amended complaint, NICA raised three defenses. First, it maintained that RIMS was estopped from claiming an easement by prescription because it had “sworn under oath that its right of access to Lot [No.] 82 is based solely on its deed.” Second, NICA asserted that plaintiff was unable to prove that all the elements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement had been satisfied. Finally, NICA contended that plaintiff was precluded', 'otherwise, on the tenant or occupant, if there be any; and the', 'notice, with the return thereon, shall be recorded within three (3)', 'months thereafter in the records of land evidence in the town in', 'which the land is situated, and a copy of the record, certified by the', 'recording officer to be a true copy of the record of the notice, and', 'the return thereon, shall be evidence of the notice and of the', 'service of the same.” 7', 'Section 34-7-7 provides:', '“Whenever notice is given to prevent the acquisition of', 'lands or way, privilege or other easement, the notice shall be', 'considered so far a disturbance of the right or claim as to enable', 'the party claiming to bring an action for disturbing the same, in', 'order to try the right; and if the plaintiff in the suit prevails, he or', 'she shall recover full costs.” 8', 'RIMS later amended its complaint a second time to add a paragraph concerning its alleged right to park vehicles on lot No. 81. However, the trial justice never ruled on this issue, instead finding that plaintiff only had the right to cross lot No. 81, and plaintiff did not raise the issue before this Court. Therefore, we shall not address it. 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-11-28 says that “[i]n any conveyance of real estate all rights, privileges, and appurtenances belonging or appertaining to the granted estate shall be included in the conveyance, unless a different intention shall clearly appear in the deed, and it shall be unnecessary to enumerate or mention them either generally or specifically.”', '-4- from bringing a prescriptive easement claim because its land was held for conservation purposes, thus triggering the provisions of § 34-7-9. The case was tried before a justice of the Superior Court, sitting without a jury, in 2010. 10', 'B', 'Trial', 'At trial, John Crandall testified for plaintiff about his use, and his family’s use, of lot No. 82, and their travel over lot No. 81. He testified that he began using his family’s property, lot No. 82, in the early 1930s. This use included swimming, clamming, hunting and trapping animals, and cutting sea grass to use as bedding for livestock on the family farm. John Crandall said that he remembered driving to the lot via the sand trail with his father. He also testified that they normally would park their vehicle on the south side of the sand trail and then walk north to their property, but that occasionally they would drive directly onto their lot when the creek either was dried up or low enough to pass over with a truck.', 'John Crandall’s son, Steven Crandall, also testified on behalf of plaintiff. He said that he began using lot No. 82 in the early 1970s. He also testified that he had visited lot No. 82 with his father and that they generally parked on the south side of the sand trail and walked north, across defendant’s land, to their property. Steven Crandall, forty-two at the time of trial, also said that he began driving directly onto lot No. 82 when he was about sixteen or eighteen years old. He later testified at trial that he began driving onto the lot in the late 1980s and that getting access to “lot [No.] 82 in this way [was] a continuous thing.” However, it is significant that, in a pretrial deposition, Steven Crandall asserted that he began driving onto the lot after there was a wash over of the creek, which he believed was in the mid-1990s. On cross-examination at trial, when 10', 'We are unable to discern any valid reason why the case consumed more than ten years before it was tried. We are now deciding this appeal some thirteen years after the complaint was filed.', '-5- questioned about his deposition answer, he said that he was unsure exactly when he began driving onto the lot, but later maintained that it was in the late 1980s. He testified that he drove onto the lot “many times.” 11', 'C', 'Decision', 'After the testimony at trial had concluded, the trial justice issued a written decision in which he found that plaintiff had established an easement over defendant’s property. In his findings, the trial justice noted that the Crandall family had used lot No. 82 “for quahogging, bathing, duck hunting and trapping,” as well as a yearly clambake in the 1990s. He also said that the Crandalls had “accessed their property, by foot and vehicle, by leaving the sand trail and walking over the Nope’s beachfront for many decades.”', 'The trial justice observed that “[u]sually, the Crandalls’ use of the property was not noticeable, given the tranquility of the area through most of the year”; however, “[t]here were some exceptions, such as the yearly clambake.”', 'The trial justice also found that “[t]he Crandall family was never told that they could not drive to their property from the sand trail,” and “[t]hey did so, openly, for over 70 years.” He then went on to say that they “drove onto the property occasionally, depending on the condition of the creek,” and that “[t]hey were not told to limit their vehicular use, or any other use during these decades.”', 'The trial justice made these findings based on the testimony of the witnesses at trial. It is noteworthy that when he assessed the credibility of those witnesses, he found that John Crandall was “thoughtful, earnest and helpful to the [c]ourt,” and that his testimony was “highly credible, 11', 'Several other witnesses testified at the trial, including land surveyors and current and former members of RIMS and NICA.', '-6- consistent and responsive.” However, that was not the case with respect to Steven Crandall’s testimony; the trial justice found that that testimony was “dedicated to the RIMS case,” and that he was “evasive and vague” during part of his testimony, and “inconsistent” about when he could, and actually did, get access to lot No. 82. The trial justice did find the remainder of his testimony to be “fairly credible.”', 'After making his credibility determinations and findings of fact, the trial justice concluded that “the Crandall family accessed their property, by foot and vehicle, by leaving the sand trail and walking over the Nope’s beachfront for many decades,” and that “[t]his use was actual, open, and continuous.” Furthermore, he found that the Crandalls believed they had the right to travel over lot No. 81 and that they did so in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the true owners. Therefore, he found that the Crandalls’ use of the property was hostile and under a claim of right. The trial justice found that each of these elements had been proven “clearly, convincingly and with satisfactory evidence.”', 'In his decision, the trial justice also observed that in Rhode Island one cannot establish a prescriptive easement by foot traffic alone. 12 However, he reiterated that “[t]he Crandalls drove trucks and other vehicles to their lot.” Finally, the trial justice held that § 34-7-9 did not bar plaintiff from asserting its claim for a prescriptive easement. He reasoned that the statute was not enacted until after 2007, and by that time, plaintiff’s right to use the property had vested in it because of the use of plaintiff’s predecessor in title. Therefore, he reasoned that the General Assembly’s enactment of the statute did not divest plaintiff of a right that it already had acquired. 12', 'In his decision, the trial justice cited Anthony v. Searle, 681 A.2d 892, 898 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Gammons v. Caswell, 447 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1982)), in which this Court held that, to acquire property by adverse possession, a claimant must use “the land in a more significant fashion than merely walking across it.” We note that this holding is codified in § 34-7-4, which provides that “[n]o right of footway, except claimed in connection with a right to pass with carriages, shall be acquired by prescription or adverse use for any length of time.”', '-7- Accordingly, the trial justice found that plaintiff held an easement to get access to its own property by traveling over defendant’s property.', 'The trial justice then went on to define and limit the easement. He first determined that the easement would run from the sand trail, across defendant’s property, and to lot No. 82. He then ruled that the easement would be for foot and vehicular traffic and that it would be wide enough for one vehicle to pass through at a time. However, the number of vehicles that may pass was to remain unlimited. Finally, his decision allowed NICA to choose the precise location of the easement over its property, and further permitted it to change that location once per year. Judgment was entered on March 9, 2011, and defendant timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court gives great weight to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil matter, and we will not disturb such findings unless they are ‘clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.’” Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 86 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Costa v. Silva, 996 A.2d 607, 611 (R.I. 2010)). Also, “it is permissible for the trial justice to ‘draw inferences from the testimony of witnesses, and such inferences, if reasonable, are entitled on review to the same weight as other factual determinations.’” Id. (quoting DeSimone Electric, Inc. v. CMG, Inc., 901 A.2d 613, 621 (R.I. 2006)). However, we review questions of law and statutory interpretation de novo. Id.; see also Reynolds v. Town of Jamestown, 45 A.3d 537, 541 (R.I. 2012) (citing Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009)).', '-8-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant advances two reasons why it believes the trial justice erred when he decided that the requirements for a prescriptive easement over its property had been met. First, defendant argues that plaintiff was precluded from claiming a prescriptive easement by the express provisions in § 34-7-9 and that the relation-back doctrine does not save plaintiff from the limits set forth in that statute. Second, defendant contends that even if plaintiff was not barred from bringing such a claim, it nonetheless failed to satisfy the elements of a prescriptive easement. Finally, defendant requests that this Court adopt a “higher standard” for proving a claim for adverse possession or a prescriptive easement against an owner of conservation or open land and that we should make use of that standard in our analysis of this case. We shall address each of these issues in turn.', 'A', 'Section 34-7-9 and the Relation-Back Doctrine', 'Section 34-7-9 provides that “[a]ny land held or preserved by a nonprofit corporation or nonprofit association for purposes of conservation, open space, or a cemetery is not subject to adverse possession or prescription.” The defendant argues that this statute serves as a bar to plaintiff from claiming an easement by prescription over its land, which is held for conservation purposes. The plaintiff responds by arguing that § 34-7-9 was not enacted until 2008 and, therefore, it did not serve to bar the claim in this case, because its claim was raised in the complaint that was filed in 2000. We agree with plaintiff.', '“[T]his Court presumes that statutes and their amendments operate prospectively” absent “clear, strong language or a necessary implication that the General Assembly intended to give', '-9- the statute retroactive effect.” Direct Action for Rights & Equality v. Gannon, 819 A.2d 651, 658 (R.I. 2003). We can discern no indication from the Legislature that § 34-7-9 was intended to apply retrospectively. To the contrary, the Legislature indicated that the “act would take effect upon passage.” P.L. 2008, ch. 63, § 2; P.L. 2008, ch. 67, § 2. As a result, the statute must be applied prospectively, and, therefore, it did not preclude plaintiff from asserting an easement by prescription in 2000. See, e.g., Kaveny v. Town of Cumberland Zoning Board of Review, 875 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2005) (holding that a statute is to be applied prospectively when the Legislature indicated that the “act shall take effect upon passage,” quoting P.L. 2004, ch. 3, § 2; P.L. 2004, ch. 4, § 2).', 'Arguing in the alternative, defendant contends that even if § 34-7-9 applies prospectively, it nevertheless precluded plaintiff from bringing its prescriptive-easement claim because plaintiff’s initial complaint, filed in 2000, contained no mention of a prescriptive easement. 13 The defendant maintains that plaintiff’s prescriptive-easement claim was not raised until it filed an amended complaint in 2010, well after § 34-7-9 took effect. Furthermore, defendant contends that the prescriptive-easement claim lodged in the amended complaint does not “relate back” to the date of the initial complaint under Rule 15(c), because the claim “sets forth new facts as well as a new legal theory.”', 'Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires that “[a] pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, * * * shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.” This Court has held that “[a] pleading need not include ‘the ultimate facts that 13', 'The defendant contends that the initial complaint set forth only a right of access to lot No. 82 by deed. However, our review reveals that nowhere in that complaint does plaintiff make such an assertion.', '- 10 - must be proven in order to succeed on the complaint * * * [or] to set out the precise legal theory upon which his or her claim is based.’” Gardner v. Baird, 871 A.2d 949, 953 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 848 (R.I. 1992)). Rather, “[t]he pleading simply must provide the opposing party with ‘fair and adequate notice of the type of claim being asserted.’” Id. (quoting Haley, 611 A.2d at 848).', 'The plaintiff’s initial complaint alleged that defendant “ha[d] sent notice to [p]laintiff RIMS pursuant to R.I.G.L. §34-7-6 disputing any right claimed by RIMS to pass and re-pass over its (Nope’s Island) real estate to gain access to real estate owned by RIMS.” The complaint went on to say: “Pursuant to RIGL §34-7-7 RIMS now brings this action in order to try the right, which right Nope’s Island is attempting to disturb, that is the right of RIMS members to gain access to its property over land claimed by Nope’s Island to be its (Nope’s Island’s) property.”', 'Although the precise words “prescriptive easement” were not set forth in the complaint, it is nonetheless our opinion that the initial complaint provided defendant with “fair and adequate notice” that plaintiff was asserting that it held an easement by prescription. Gardner, 871 A.2d at 953 (quoting Haley, 611 A.2d at 848). First, it is patently obvious that the complaint was filed in response to defendant’s notice of intent to interrupt adverse possession. Second, the stated purpose of the complaint was to bring an action “to try the right, * * * of RIMS members to gain access to its property over [NICA’s] property.” Black’s Law Dictionary 585-86 (9th ed. 2009) defines the word “easement” as “[a]n interest in land owned by another person, consisting in the right to use or control the land * * * for a specific limited purpose (such as to cross it for access to a public road).” When comparing this definition to the language in the complaint, it is difficult to conclude that plaintiff could have been asserting any type of claim other than for an easement by prescription.', '- 11 -', 'Accordingly, we hold that plaintiff satisfied the requirements of Rule 8(a) by putting defendant on sufficient notice that it was asserting that it held a prescriptive easement. That claim was brought in 2000, before § 34-7-9 was enacted. Thus, the statute did not preclude plaintiff from bringing such a claim. And, because plaintiff’s first complaint sufficiently pleaded a claim for an easement by prescription, it is not necessary for us to decide whether the amended complaint relates back to the date of the initial complaint. 14', 'B', 'Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'The defendant’s second argument is that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the elements of a prescriptive easement were satisfied. “We have long recognized that ‘one who claims an easement by prescription has the burden of establishing actual, open, notorious, hostile and continuous use under a claim of right for ten years as required by * * * § 34-7-1.’” 15 Reitsma v. 14', 'The defendant also contends that plaintiff is estopped from claiming a prescriptive right of access because plaintiff made “an affirmative representation of [the] material fact” that it had a right of access by deed and that defendant reasonably relied on that fact to its disadvantage. However, as stated above, nowhere in the original complaint does plaintiff assert a right of access by deed. The only place in the entire record in which plaintiff refers to access by deed is in its answer to defendant’s interrogatory number five. In our opinion, no reasonable person would have relied on this single answer to an interrogatory when determining plaintiff’s theory of the case, especially when the complaint clearly asserted a different theory. Therefore, we see no merit in defendant’s estoppel argument.', 'In a footnote, defendant also argues that plaintiff has waived its right to claim an easement by prescription because it failed to assert that one existed in its initial complaint. However, as we have said above, plaintiff did sufficiently assert a claim for a prescriptive easement in its initial complaint, and therefore, this argument also misses the mark. 15', 'Section 34-7-1 provides, in pertinent part:', '“Where any person or persons, or others from whom he,', 'she, or they derive their title, either by themselves, tenants or', 'lessees, shall have been for the space of ten (10) years in the', 'uninterrupted, quiet, peaceful and actual seisin and possession of', 'any lands, tenements or hereditaments for and during that time,', 'claiming the same as his, her or their proper, sole and rightful', 'estate in fee simple, the actual seisin and possession shall be', '- 12 - Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 831 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1020 (R.I. 1999)). However, before addressing defendant’s argument that plaintiff failed to satisfy the requisite elements, we first will address its argument about the appropriate standard of proof to be used in this case.', '1', 'The Appropriate Standard of Proof', 'The defendant suggests that this Court should adopt a heightened standard of proof because the property at issue is both open space and preserved for conservation. The defendant cites six cases from other jurisdictions that would support a new standard that it proposes is appropriate here. Indeed, defendant suggests that § 34-7-9, which precludes a claim of adverse possession or prescription against the owners of land held for conservation or open space, represents “the logical extension of the policy expressed in these cases.” Although arguably § 34-7-9 will render this issue moot in any future case, we, nonetheless, will address the question here because, as discussed above, plaintiff’s claim was brought before that statute was enacted.', 'In no case from this jurisdiction have we applied the heightened standard of proof for which defendant argues. Furthermore, we never have suggested that such a standard would be appropriate. Rather, we have consistently held that a claimant in an adverse-possession or prescription case must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. See Cahill, 11 A.3d at 88 (“The party who asserts that adverse possession has occurred must establish the required elements by strict proof, that is, proof by clear and convincing evidence.” quoting Corrigan v. Nanian, 950 A.2d 1179, 1179 (R.I. 2008) (mem.)); Hilley v. Lawrence, 972 A.2d 643, 652 (R.I.', 'allowed to give and make a good and rightful title to the person or', 'persons, their heirs and assigns forever; and any plaintiff suing for', 'the recovery of any such lands may rely upon the possession as', 'conclusive title thereto * * *.”', '- 13 - 2009) (“The claimant must prove each element by clear and satisfactory evidence.”). We see no reason to depart from our well settled case law—and, therefore, decline defendant’s invitation to adopt a new standard in this case—and we shall apply the standard of clear and convincing evidence as we have in the past. 16', '2', 'Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'Applying the clear-and-convincing standard to the trial justice’s factual findings, as well as to the record before us, we are not satisfied that sufficient evidence was produced that would justify a conclusion that a prescriptive easement was established. Specifically, the record does not clearly demonstrate that the Crandalls continuously got access to lot No. 82 by vehicle for the statutorily required ten-year period.', 'In his decision, the trial justice stated that “[b]y allowing the use of pedestrian traffic but restricting the use of vehicular traffic, [NICA] is parsing terms.” He went on to say that “[n]either the case law nor the statute (R.I.G.L. § 34-7-1 regarding adverse possession) appears to distinguish between different modes of use of the easement by prescription.” In our opinion, this is a misstatement of the law.', 'Section 34-7-4, provides that “[n]o right of footway, except claimed in connection with a right to pass with carriages, shall be acquired by prescription or adverse use for any length of time.” In applying that section, this Court has stated: “It is clear that even ‘long-continued use 16', '“Clear and convincing evidence is defined in a variety of ways; for example, to establish a fact or an element by clear and convincing evidence a party must persuade the jury that the proposition is highly probable, or must produce in the mind of the factfinder a firm belief or conviction that the allegations in question are true. The clear and convincing evidence standard does not require that the evidence negate all reasonable doubt or that the evidence must be uncontroverted.” Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 88 n.7 (R.I. 2011) (quoting 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 173 at 188-89 (2008)).', '- 14 - by footpassers over the [way] * * * cannot establish an easement * * *.’” Palisades Sales Corp. v.

Thus, it is evident that “actual, open, notorious, hostile and continuous” vehicular use is required to establish an easement by prescription. Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 831 (quoting Burke-Tarr Co., 724 A.2d at 1020). In our opinion, the trial justice erred when he conflated the pedestrian and vehicular use, and it is necessary for the trial justice to separate his findings of fact concerning which method of travel the Crandalls used when crossing lot No. 81. In short, he must distinguish between pedestrian and vehicular use. 17', 'In his decision, the trial justice found that “[t]he Crandall family was never told that they could not drive to their property from the sand trail,” and “[t]hey did so, openly, for over 70 years.” He then went on to say that they “drove onto the property occasionally, depending on the condition of the creek.” He found that “[u]ntil the 1980s the Crandalls accessed the lot less than ten times per year”; however, the frequency of trips across lot No. 81 by vehicle remains unclear.', 'Furthermore, the trial justice concluded that the Crandalls “accessed their property, by foot and vehicle, by leaving the sand trail and walking over the Nope’s beachfront for many decades,” and that “[t]his use was actual, open, and continuous.” However, because the trial justice conflated the Crandalls’ pedestrian use with their vehicular use, we simply cannot glean sufficient evidence from the record to support his conclusion that the Crandalls crossed from the sand trail to lot No. 82 in a continuous manner by vehicle. 17', 'Because defendant currently has a policy that allows people to walk on its property, it argues that we need not address whether plaintiff has the prescriptive right to walk across its land to get access to lot No. 82. However, this issue must be addressed because defendant could, at any time, change this policy to prohibit people from walking on its land. Yet, in doing so, we must remain cognizant of § 34-7-4.', '- 15 -', 'The trial justice also did not specify when he believed the prescriptive easement vested. Instead, he said only that “[b]y [2008], the Crandalls had * * * acquired their rights in the easement.” Therefore, it is difficult for us to determine from the record whether or not the elements of § 34-7-1 have been satisfied for the requisite ten-year period.', 'Based on our review of the record, we are left to speculate about any span of time when all elements might have been satisfied. The testimony centered on two periods when this may have occurred. The first was when John Crandall and his father crossed lot No. 81 in a truck to get to lot No. 82, which appears from the record to have occurred in the 1930s and 1940s. The second was when Steven Crandall said he sometimes drove across defendant’s lot to get to lot No. 82, which ran from the late 1980s to 1999, at which time the lot was conveyed to RIMS. These are the only two periods about which the record contains evidence of the Crandalls crossing from the sand trail to lot No. 82 by vehicle. However, as to each, there is insufficient evidence in the record, as it now stands, to demonstrate continuous vehicular use by clear and convincing evidence.', 'John Crandall’s testimony concerning vehicular use is minimal and he was asked only two questions about such use. The first exchange occurred on direct examination and is as follows:', '“Q', 'Now did there come a time when you drove directly on to [lot No.', '82]?', '“A', 'At times we did. Like I say, sometimes you go down there and', 'there’s a foot of water and then again you’d have two inches of', 'water then it would be dry. So, you never knew what you were', 'going to face when you got there. You know, you either get the', 'dry bed there or drive in there or else you could park on the other', 'side or whatever, you know.” The second exchange, which took place on cross-examination, occurred as follows:', '“Q', 'Did you ever directly drive a vehicle on to lot [No.] 82?', '- 16 -', '“* * *', '“A', 'Yes, on occasion we did, yes.', '“Q', 'When?', '“A', 'When we - - when we, I personally didn’t drive it but my father', 'did.

We', 'tried to catch it when that creek was dry so we could just back off', 'on to that lot.', '“Q', 'Was it - - you never personally ever drove a vehicle on to the lot,', 'and as I understand you – the only time you were in a vehicle that', 'went on to [lot No. 82] was when you were with your father?', '“A', 'That is right.” That evidence is insufficient to establish continuous vehicular use of the land in question for the requisite ten-year period, especially under the clear-and-convincing standard.', 'The second era in which the Crandalls may have satisfied all the elements of a prescriptive easement occurred in the late 1980s to 1999, when Steven Crandall used lot No. 82. He testified that he began driving onto the lot in the late 1980s, that he did so “many times,” and that getting access to “lot [No.] 82 in this way [was] a continuous thing.” However, in Steven Crandall’s deposition, he previously had testified that he began driving onto the lot after there was a wash over, which, he believed, occurred in the mid-1990s. If this is to be believed, his testimony failed to establish vehicular use of the land for the statutory ten-year period, because his family no longer owned lot No. 82 after 1999, thus failing to satisfy the ten-year statutory requirement.', 'When cross-examined about his previous deposition answer, Steven Crandall said that he was unsure exactly when he began driving onto the lot, but he later maintained that it was in the late 1980s. It is significant, however, that the trial justice found his testimony to be less than credible because it was “dedicated to the RIMS case” and that he was “evasive and vague” during part of his testimony, and “inconsistent” about when he could, and actually did, get to lot No. 82 by vehicle. Additionally, the trial justice found the remainder of his testimony to be only', '- 17 - “fairly credible.” Because of the inconsistencies in Steven Crandall’s testimony and the trial justice’s assessment that his credibility was less than stellar, continuous vehicular use has not been established by clear and convincing evidence for this period either.', 'The lack of clarity in the findings of fact, as they currently appear, does not justify the conclusion that a prescriptive easement was established by clear and convincing evidence. In our opinion, to determine whether an easement was created, there must be additional and more specific findings of fact. The trial justice must determine whether the Crandalls used vehicles to cross from the sand trail to lot No. 82, continuously for at least ten years. See Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 831. In doing so, the trial justice should make specific findings of fact, including, if possible, the frequency of the vehicular use, the number of times vehicles were used, and in what years they were used.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

(DFP Inc.) appeals from both the Superior Court’s denial of its motion for summary judgment and from its grant of judgment, after a bench trial, in favor of the plaintiff, Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Nationwide) in the amount of $283,964.27. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in finding that Dean Pepper was negligent and, further, that Nationwide’s claim as subrogee of Dean Pepper should have been barred by both the antisubrogation rule 1 and the terms of the Nationwide policy. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The events giving rise to this dispute took place on a snowy night in February 2009. Dean Pepper, the owner and sole shareholder of DFP Inc. had been working on one of his trucks 1', 'Briefly stated, the antisubrogation rule provides that no right of subrogation can arise in favor of an insurer against its own insured. 16 Lee R. Russ and Thomas F. Segalia Couch on Insurance 3d § 224:1 (2005).', '-1- at a friend’s garage in the early morning of February 4, before returning to his home at the corner of Plainfield Pike and Capitol Street in the Town of Johnston. The house was situated “hard by the corner,” set back only five feet from Plainfield Pike and three and a half to four feet from Capitol Street. Once home, Pepper noticed that Capitol Street, a small secondary road, was still snow-covered. After clearing the snow from his own property, Pepper used a backhoe to plow Capitol Street from his property to Plainfield Pike, as he had done on prior occasions. After plowing, Pepper noted that the surface of Capitol Street was “hard packed” and icy. Observing that Plainfield Pike was in good condition, Pepper decided to park the backhoe and take DFP Inc.’s 1998 Mack dump truck to Dunkin’ Donuts, a short distance away.', 'A short while later, at around 2 a.m., Pepper returned to his house. Pepper drove down Plainfield Pike and took the left turn onto Capitol Street “very slowly.” Once on the “hard packed, slippery” Capitol Street, the truck slid downhill and to the right, hitting Pepper’s house at the corner. The force of the impact caused the front end of the truck to crash through the foundation and west side wall of the house. The house sustained structural damage to the extent that it later was condemned and demolished. After the accident, Pepper got out of his truck on Capitol Street and immediately fell on the icy surface, realizing that it was “much slipperier than [he] thought it was.” The police officer who responded to the scene noted:', '“the road conditions at the time of this accident were extremely', 'poor. The area had received approximately 3”-5” of snow and the', 'roadways were very icy. Plainfield St. was plowed down to the', 'asphalt, but was not treated with any sand or salt, thus exposing', '‘black ice.’ Capitol St. was neither plowed nor treated with any', 'sand or salt and was basically a layer of snow on top of hard', 'packed ice.”', 'The house was insured by Nationwide, and the dump truck, which was registered to DFP Inc., was insured by Merchants Mutual Insurance Company (Merchants). Dean Pepper filed a', '-2- claim with Nationwide under his homeowner’s policy, and Nationwide paid the loss. Under its homeowner’s policy, the insurer has a right of subrogation against third parties who caused the loss that it was obligated to reimburse. Nationwide, as subrogee of Pepper, then exercised that right by filing suit against DFP Inc., the registered owner of the truck, alleging vicarious liability for the negligence of its employee, Pepper. In its complaint, Nationwide alleged that Pepper had been negligent in his operation of the vehicle, in failing to “keep the tractor trailer in the roadway,” in failing to use reasonable care and to drive in a manner appropriate to the road conditions, and, finally, in “creating an unreasonably dangerous condition.” Nationwide asserted that, because Pepper was acting within the scope of his employment, DFP Inc. is vicariously liable under both the principle of respondeat superior and state law. The Merchants policy defines its “insureds” as both DFP Inc. and “[a]nyone else while using with your permission a covered ‘auto’ * * *.”', 'The defendant, DFP Inc. moved for summary judgment, arguing that the claims were barred under the antisubrogation rule. The plaintiff, Nationwide, then filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the antisubrogation rule would not apply here because Nationwide would recover not from its insured (Pepper), but from a separate entity (DFP Inc.). The motions were heard on August 31, 2010, at which time the trial justice found that the question of whether Pepper was acting within the scope of his employment was a material fact in dispute; he therefore denied both motions.', 'On January 18, 2011, the day before trial, the parties appeared before the trial justice and stipulated that, under G.L. 1956 § 31-33-6, “the owner of a vehicle may be vicariously liable for the conduct of someone who has consent to drive the vehicle if the underlying driver is in fact negligent.” Further, DFP Inc. acknowledged that it did not “dispute that Dean Pepper had', '-3- consent to drive the vehicle in question.” Accordingly, trial proceeded the next day on the issues of negligence and damages.', 'At trial, Pepper was the only witness on the issue of negligence, and Bethany Moura was the sole witness testifying to the value of the home. The trial justice found that Pepper “felt that there was sufficient snow on Capitol Street that he chose to plow [it] voluntarily.” The court “accept[ed] the driver’s contention that he was driving slowly,” but it observed that “even slowly this was at a speed greater than is reasonably prudent under the conditions * * *. Specifically, his speed was not so controlled as to avoid leaving the roadway and hitting the house.” The court held that Pepper was negligent in failing to keep his vehicle under control and because “he did not observe and take into consideration the surrounding circumstances, including the conditions of the roadway that he had plowed.” The trial justice also reiterated his prior ruling, noting that DFP Inc. and Dean Pepper are separate entities and thus, because there had been no allegation of a “sham” corporation, the antisubrogation rule does not apply in this case. On June 3, 2011, after receiving posttrial memoranda, the court issued a judgment in favor of Nationwide for $283,964.27. 2 On June 13, 2011, DFP Inc. filed the instant appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that ‘[t]his Court will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence * * *.’” Reagan v.

(quoting Notarantonio, 941 A.2d at 144).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant raises two issues. 3 First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in finding that Pepper had been negligent. Second, defendant contends that plaintiff’s claim should have been barred by both the antisubrogation rule and the terms and conditions of the Nationwide homeowner’s policy.', 'A', 'Negligence', '“It is well settled that to prevail on a claim of negligence ‘a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.’” Habershaw v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1276 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009)). Duty here is established under Rhode Island law, which prohibits operators of motor vehicles from driving “at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and potential 3', 'The defendant appeals both the denial of his motion for summary judgment and the final judgment. However, this would appear to be procedurally defective. “Because an order denying a motion for summary judgment is an interlocutory determination and is not entitled to an appeal of right, we do not generally review such a denial.” McKinnon v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, 713 A.2d 245, 247 (R.I. 1998). “The denial of a motion for summary judgment merely determines that a fact issue is involved, and does not even establish the law of the case.” Rhode Island Public Telecommunications Authority v. Russell, 914 A.2d 984, 991 (R.I. 2007) (quoting 73 Am. Jur. 2d Summary Judgment § 62 at 701 (2001)).

It is the decision in that trial that is properly before this Court.', '-5- hazards then existing.” G.L. 1956 § 31-14-1. Further, “speed shall be so controlled as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle, or other conveyance * * *.” Id. Neither causation nor damages are contested by the parties. The issue before this Court is whether the trial justice was correct in holding that Pepper breached his duty by failing to control the vehicle sufficiently to prevent its collision with the house.', 'The trial justice held that Pepper was negligent “as he did not observe and take into consideration the surrounding circumstances including the conditions of the roadway that he had plowed.” Further, “[the driver] also did not keep his vehicle under control [as] noted by the truck leaving the roadway.” The court concluded by stating,', '“while this [c]ourt accepts the driver’s contention that he was', 'driving slowly, even slowly this was at a speed greater than is', 'reasonably prudent under the conditions and having regard to the', 'actual potential hazards that existed. Specifically, his speed was', 'not so controlled as to avoid leaving the roadway and hitting the', 'house.”', 'Although plaintiff argued that defendant created an unreasonably dangerous condition, it does not appear that the trial justice held that, in voluntarily undertaking to plow Capitol Street, defendant had done so negligently, thus creating the hazard. Instead, we understand that the trial justice’s reference to defendant’s plowing was to illustrate that he had notice of the dangerous condition—the hard packed ice beneath the snow: “The [driver] * * * felt that there was sufficient snow on Capitol Street that he chose to plow that part of a public street around his home voluntarily.” Absent a determination that Pepper created the hazardous condition by negligent plowing, his failure to drive slowly enough to avoid colliding with the house is the apparent basis for the finding of the breach of a duty.', 'We note that there was a paucity of evidence introduced at trial tending to show negligence. Dean Pepper was the sole witness testifying to the events surrounding the accident.', '-6- The trial justice found his testimony about his slow rate of speed to be credible. There was no evidence that Pepper had been drinking or was otherwise impaired. The trial justice did state that “[t]he [c]ourt gives great weight to the police report that indicates that the road conditions were extremely poor and very icy;” however, it is a long-standing principle of this Court that “[t]he fact that a motor vehicle skids on a highway which is slippery is not evidence in and of itself that the vehicle was negligently handled * * *.” Peters v. United Electric Railways Co., 53 R.I. 251, 255-56, 165 A. 773, 774 (1933). Nevertheless, it is our opinion that, in the case under review, it is reasonable to infer from the extent of the damage to the house that Pepper was driving in excess of the speed that was appropriate to the conditions. This Court applies a deferential standard of review to mixed questions of law and fact. See Reagan, 43 A.3d at 37. We will not substitute our opinion for that of the trial justice where “competent evidence supports the trial justice[’]s findings * * * even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Id. (quoting Notarantonio, 941 A.2d at 144). Accordingly, we perceive no cause to disturb the finding of negligence by the trial justice.', 'B', 'Antisubrogation Rule', 'The antisubrogation rule has not yet been embraced by this Court. In courts where it has been applied, it is based upon “the basic definition of subrogation as a right that arises only with respect to rights of the insured against third persons to whom the insurer owes no duty * * *.” 16 Couch on Insurance 3d § 224:1. It follows, then, “that no right of subrogation can arise in favor of an insurer against its own insured.” Id. The public policy underlying this rule is two-fold: an insurer should not be allowed to pass on a loss to its insured that the insured has paid premiums', '-7- to cover, and to avoid a conflict of interest in which an insurer lacks the incentive to provide a vigorous defense to its insured. Id. § 224:3.', 'The defendant argues that the antisubrogation rule should be applied to prevent Nationwide from recovering from DFP Inc. because, if recovery is allowed, then Merchants, as insurer of the truck, will pay the claim and then exercise its right of subrogation against Pepper. 4 Thus, through this circular chain, Nationwide would recover from its own insured. It is not necessary to follow such an attenuated route in applying the antisubrogation rule.', 'If circumstances proceed as the defendant suggests, the appropriate opportunity to consider whether this Court should adopt the antisubrogation rule would arise if and when Merchants seeks to recover from Pepper. The language of the Merchants policy purportedly covers Pepper, who was driving the truck with DFP Inc.’s consent, as an insured. Should Merchants choose to proceed against Pepper, that insurer arguably would be attempting to exercise a right of subrogation against its own insured. The issue might then be ripe for review; at this juncture it is merely speculative. In the circumstances of this case, Nationwide is seeking to exercise its right of subrogation against DFP Inc., a distinct legal entity from its insured, Pepper. We are satisfied, therefore, that even if we were to recognize the antisubrogation rule, it would have no application to the facts underlying this appeal.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record of this case shall be remanded to the Superior Court. 4', 'The Nationwide policy does not provide personal liability coverage for damage to property of the insured, and thus the defendant contends that the language of the policy itself should prevent Nationwide from recovering from DFP Inc. because Nationwide would not provide coverage to Pepper for any potential recovery by Merchants as subrogee of DFP Inc.', '-8-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Company as subrogee', 'of Dean F.

This case came before the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari on November 29, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. James Paola (defendant or Paola) appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding him guilty of several acts of child molestation and sexual assault.1 Specifically, on September 19, 2008, Paola was found guilty of one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and one count of third-degree sexual assault arising from a series of assaults upon his stepdaughter, whom we shall refer to as Sarah, and one count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault arising from a single incident concerning another stepdaughter, whom we shall refer to as Samantha.2', 'On November 24, 2008, the trial justice heard and denied defendant‟s motion for a new trial. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to concurrent sentences of thirty years, eighteen years 1', 'The defendant filed an untimely notice of appeal on March 24, 2009. Thereafter, appointed counsel from the Public Defender‟s Office filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to review the judgments of conviction.

Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1996, a romantic relationship developed between Paola and the mother of Sarah and Samantha; we shall refer to the mother as Mary. In addition to Sarah and Samantha, Mary had a third daughter, Emma, from a previous marriage, and Paola and Mary welcomed another daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in 1997. The two married in 1998, and the family took up residence in Warwick, Rhode Island.3', 'In February of 2000, Sarah was eight years old, Emma was seven, and Samantha was five.4', 'Paola, who worked as a college recruiter, was described as an active father and stepfather. According to Sarah, Paola assumed the role of a father to her and her sisters; they would travel with him—together or individually—on his recruiting trips. Unfortunately, when Sarah turned eleven or twelve, their father-daughter relationship changed significantly because Paola developed a sexual interest in her.', 'Sarah testified that the first assault occurred in the downstairs family room, when, after watching a movie, the rest of the family went upstairs. Sarah and Paola stayed behind to watch 3', 'In that house, Sarah shared a bedroom with her youngest sister, Elizabeth, while Samantha and Emma shared a separate bedroom. 4', 'Sarah was born on October 22, 1991; Emma was born on January 12, 1993; and Samantha was born on August 26, 1994.', '-2- another movie, when Paola began rubbing her feet and legs, which was not an uncommon occurrence. On this occasion, however, Paola worked his hands all the way up her legs and placed his fingers into her vagina.', 'Sarah, who testified that she was confused about this occurrence, did not disclose the touching to anyone. She testified that she “didn‟t mind it” and “it felt good.”', 'After that night, Paola‟s affection for Sarah manifested itself in several ways; he bought her jewelry, including a charm bracelet, but instructed her to say that it was a gift from a friend. He also arranged to chaperone several of Sarah‟s school trips, including a trip to Washington, D.C. According to Sarah, Paola became angry with her when she did not spend enough time with him during the trip. Notwithstanding that quarrel, Paola bought Sarah a sweatshirt, a box of chocolates, and a silver “dog-tag” necklace.5', 'Paola also told Sarah that “he loved how close [they] were” and “we belong[] together.” He penned notes to Sarah, which he would put in her lunch bag or on her pillow.6 One such note—written in the wake of Paola‟s anger at Sarah for breaking the no-dating rule that he and Mary had instituted for the children—reminded Sarah that she was a “hot precious commodity” and cautioned her to “be careful how [she] flirt[s] with people” because “[i]t can cause problems.” These missives often described how “special” their relationship was. Likewise, he wrote that they were “meant to be friends, close friends at that, for years to come! Forever.” (Emphasis in original.)', 'The second sexual assault of which defendant was convicted also occurred in the family 5', 'Sarah testified that the necklace made her feel as though she belonged to him. 6', 'These notes were markedly different from the innocuous notes he would place in the lunch bags of his other stepdaughters; Paola spent more time writing long notes to Sarah, and those notes often were romantic, possessive, or sexually suggestive.', '-3- room. At the time, Sarah was wearing boxer shorts without any underwear. When the two were alone, they began “fooling around;” while Sarah was lying down on the couch, defendant began kissing her vagina for five to ten minutes.', 'However, Mary interrupted this episode when she came downstairs. According to Mary, Paola looked startled, “like a [deer] in the headlight,” and Sarah‟s vagina was visible through her boxer shorts. Mary immediately began questioning them, but both insisted they had only been fooling around. Despite repeated inquiries by her mother, Sarah continued to deny that anything inappropriate had occurred. Sarah testified that she opted not to say anything because, again, “it felt good and [she] loved him.”', 'An incident that emerged as significant at trial was the trip that Sarah and Paola took to Atlantic City, New Jersey when Sarah was thirteen. Sarah testified that Paola had let her drive his vehicle under his supervision on at least fifty occasions. On this occasion, Sarah testified, she drove the entire trip to New Jersey and most of the return trip. According to Sarah, she and Paola stayed in a single hotel room and got dressed up for a fancy dinner. At one point, as Sarah exited the shower, she found three sets of what the trial justice characterized as “rather daring” underwear stacked in the bathroom.', 'When her mother discovered the lingerie, Sarah felt compelled to lie about its origin.', 'Certain events that transpired over the February 2006 school vacation also were explored at trial. Although it was not one of the charges of which defendant was convicted, Sarah testified that on yet another occasion in the downstairs family room, Paola began kissing her and touching her breasts. This time, Paola said, “I think [that] you‟re ready for me” before pulling down Sarah‟s sweatpants and inserting his penis into her vagina. Sarah testified that similar encounters occurred in other areas of the house during that vacation week. Emma, Sarah‟s younger sister,', '-4- testified that she observed Sarah and Paola lying side by side underneath a blanket.', 'Shortly after that school vacation, a chimney fire forced Mary to move her daughters out of the house; and, in March 2006, after experiencing marital difficulties for some time, Mary filed for divorce. No longer sharing a home, contact between Paola and Sarah became infrequent such that Paola appeared at Sarah‟s school one day. He asked school officials to have Sarah meet him at the main entrance to the school, at which point he gave Sarah her favorite lunch and asked about her current circumstances. He also inquired into whether she had “talked to anyone” about the sexual contact and cautioned her to refrain from saying “something to upset people.” The defendant advised Sarah to refrain from disclosing what they had done because, according to Paola, “what [they] did wasn‟t just sex, [they were] making love and [they] were in love.” Sarah returned inside the school building; and, although she contacted her mother about the visit, she did not disclose the abuse. A school friend observed that, after returning to class, Sarah appeared scared and upset.', 'Sarah finally confessed the sexual abuse to a friend, who advised her to report what had happened. Sarah did so to a trusted family member, whom we shall refer to as Amanda.7 With Amanda‟s support and encouragement, Sarah told her mother and the three—Sarah, Amanda, and Mary—went to the Warwick police station to file a complaint.', 'As these events unfolded, it was discovered that Paola also had abused Samantha.8 According to Samantha, she and Paola would play videogames in the downstairs family room, 7', 'The record discloses that Amanda is Paola‟s niece; she always had been close with Sarah and her sisters. 8', 'Samantha testified that she also traveled with Paola, sometimes with one of her sisters and sometimes alone. She acknowledged that Paola clearly favored Sarah, that they were “always together” and acted like they were married. Samantha stated that she also received notes in her lunch bag, but, unlike her sister, she never received jewelry or other gifts.', '-5- and on one occasion she and Paola began fighting over one of the videogame controllers. During that scuffle, Paola put his hand down Samantha‟s pants, under her underwear. In response, Samantha “jumped up” from the loveseat, hit Paola on the arm, and left the room. Samantha did not disclose this incident until after she learned that Paola had molested Sarah. In fact, Samantha previously had denied any improprieties to social service agencies. She testified that she lied because she liked Paola and did not want him to divorce Mary.', 'On October 24, 2006, a grand jury returned an indictment, charging Paola with one count of first-degree child molestation and four counts of first-degree sexual assault against Sarah, and two counts of second-degree child molestation against Samantha, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2, 11-37-3, and 11-37-8.1 through 11-37-8.4.9 In September 2008, a jury trial was held over several days in Providence County Superior Court. The state presented nine witnesses: Sarah, Samantha, Amanda, Mary, Emma, Det. Robert Page, two of Sarah‟s personal friends, and one of Mary‟s close friends. The defendant testified and denied engaging in any sexual contact, or inappropriate touching, with either of the complaining witnesses.', 'On September 19, 2008, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of first-degree child molestation against Sarah, one count of third-degree sexual assault against Sarah, and one count of second-degree child molestation against Samantha. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for a new trial in accordance with Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice denied the motion and sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of incarceration. 9', 'Before the first trial of this case, the Superior Court dismissed two of the first-degree-sexual- assault charges. The ensuing jury trial on the remaining charges ended in mistrial on October 1, 2007.', '-6- Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.', 'Standard of Review', '“When a trial justice considers whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, he or she sits as the legendary thirteenth juror; and, in light of the charge to the jury, must exercise his or her independent judgment in weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009)). Specifically, “[t]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 354 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Prout, 996 A.2d 641, 645 (R.I. 2010)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (citing State v. Snow, 670 A.2d 239, 244 (R.I. 1996)). “If the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Smith, 39 A.3d at 673 (quoting State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 967 (R.I. 2005)); see also State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 234 (R.I. 2004). We employ this deferential standard of review because “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008).', '-7-', 'Discussion', 'On appeal to this Court, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. He argues that the evidence in this case, if properly analyzed, gives rise to serious doubts about the truth of the allegations and that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence. Paola also contends that the testimony of the complaining witnesses and their mother was neither credible nor reliable, and that the jury‟s verdicts failed to do substantial justice.', 'In contesting the trial justice‟s assessment of the testimony and evidence, defendant essentially challenges the trial justice‟s credibility determinations. This Court has stated that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice‟s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010). “[T]he trial justice * * * has [had] the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position [than this Court] to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses * * *.” Id. (quoting State v. Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 5-6 (R.I. 2000)). Therefore, unless the trial justice clearly erred in his credibility determinations or “overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence,” we will not disturb the justice‟s determination on appeal. State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1368 (R.I. 1994) (quoting Fontaine v. State, 602 A.2d 521, 525 (R.I. 1992)).', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice independently evaluated the evidence and assessed the credibility of the witnesses and did not overlook relevant and material evidence. The trial justice articulated the correct standard of review and referred to his independent evaluation of the credibility of each witness who testified. In so doing, he concluded that he was “very confident” that the jury reached the appropriate verdict.', 'Specifically, the trial justice indicated that,', '-8- “[s]imply put, the state‟s case was compelling as to the counts of the conviction” and that he therefore “would have reached the same verdict as did the jury.”', 'Indeed, our careful review of the record discloses that the trial justice thoroughly reviewed and summarized the testimony of all of the trial witnesses and issued a comprehensive decision setting forth his reasons for denying the motion for a new trial. He found that the testimony of Sarah and Samantha not only was “very credible,” but also that it was corroborated by several other witnesses. The trial justice acknowledged that there were some inconsistencies in Sarah‟s testimony, but he stated that those inconsistences did not affect his conclusion that she was believable.10 Additionally, the trial justice was mindful that Samantha had lied to the social service agency about any inappropriate conduct by defendant, but he concluded that her motivation for lying—she did not want defendant and her mother to divorce—was understandable.', 'In contrast, the trial justice characterized defendant‟s testimony as “self-serving, and lacking in credibility.” The trial justice found that defendant‟s irrational explanation of such “innocuous issues” as his apparent inability to replace his bedroom door was “telling.”11 The 10', 'A serious credibility issue came to light with respect to Sarah‟s testimony that she drove from Rhode Island to Atlantic City when she was thirteen years old, but the trial justice determined that there was substantial evidence that Sarah had driven under defendant‟s supervision in the past. 11', 'Specifically, the trial justice explained that defendant‟s position that he “was just too inept to place a new [door] on the hinges”—after “the door to the marital bedroom was removed around 2004 and not put back on for over a year”—was “telling.” The trial justice expounded that,', '“[a]lthough the defendant repeatedly told [Mary] that he couldn‟t put a repaired', 'door back on because he didn‟t know how to do it, the defendant was then', 'engaged in a substantial construction project in the basement level. This made his', 'excuse completely absurd. It was clear to [Mary] (and equally clear to [the trial', 'justice]) that the defendant wished the door to remain off its hinges. This', 'provided him a ready-made excuse to avoid having intimate relations with his', 'wife while spending more and more time with his girlfriend, [Sarah].”', '-9- trial justice declared that, although defendant was “smooth, calm and well-organized,” his testimony “simply lacked credibility.” After considering the entire record, the trial justice determined that credible evidence existed to support the jury‟s finding of guilt.', 'Having concluded that he agreed with the verdict, the trial justice‟s new-trial analysis ended. See State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011) (“If the trial justice agrees with the jury‟s verdict or determines that reasonable minds could disagree about the outcome, then he or she must deny the new-trial motion * * *.”).', 'As we have stated on multiple occasions,', '“[t]his Court affords „a great deal of respect to the factual', 'determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial', 'officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and', 'parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise', 'witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that', 'cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.‟” State v.', 'DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In the Matter of', 'the Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973,', '975 (R.I. 2006)). Indeed, we “defer to trial justices who experience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness‟s testimony.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerrero, 996 A.2d 86, 90 (R.I. 2010)); see also State v.

Likewise, the trial justice placed importance on defendant‟s denial that “any marital problems were caused by the missing door[,]” especially in light of Mary‟s testimony that “[o]ne of the issues discussed at their marriage counseling was the fact that the bedroom doorway remained open, resulting in a lack of intimacy between the married couple.”', '- 10 -', 'After carefully reviewing the record before us, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material and relevant evidence, nor was he clearly wrong in accepting and rejecting the testimony of the various witnesses.

Accordingly, we perceive no error in the trial justice‟s denial of the motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

90,: v. : Jessica Ahlquist. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on November 29, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant, Jessica Ahlquist (Ahlquist or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate or plaintiff). The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in ruling that an insurance policy issued to Cheryl Crook (Cheryl)—the mother of the underinsured tortfeasor—did not cover the injuries she sustained when she was struck from behind by a vehicle operated by Cheryl‟s son, Jared Crook (Jared). The defendant further contends that the trial justice erred in holding that an exclusion contained in the Allstate policy applied to this case.', 'The trial justice, having determined that defendant failed to produce evidence demonstrating a material question of fact on either issue, granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the', '-1- parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown; we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 1, 2008, Jared was driving a 2006 Cadillac CST—which was leased for him by his father, Calvin Crook (Calvin)—when he collided with Ahlquist‟s vehicle at the intersection of Harris Avenue and Atwells Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. As a result of that accident, Ahlquist‟s car was seriously damaged and she sustained severe personal injuries.', 'The Cadillac was insured by Calvin through a policy issued by Allstate. That policy had a $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence liability limit. After Allstate paid the policy limits, Ahlquist sought to recover additional compensation through another Allstate insurance policy issued to Cheryl, Calvin‟s former wife. It is this policy that is in dispute in this case. The policy was issued for Cheryl‟s vehicle, a Ford Escape; Cheryl was the named insured, and she and Calvin were covered drivers. Under the policy‟s “Driver(s) Excluded” category, “[n]one” was listed. However, the policy also provided that a non-owned automobile would be insured if it was used by the policyholder or a resident relative with the owner‟s permission, but it further provided that the automobile “must not be available or furnished for the regular use of an insured person.”', 'On July 7, 2009, Allstate filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that Cheryl‟s insurance policy did not apply to the accident. Allstate moved for summary judgment, arguing that, under the unambiguous terms of the policy, Jared‟s operation of the Cadillac was not covered by the policy because the Cadillac was furnished for his regular use. The defendant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, countering that Cheryl‟s policy covered the accident because Jared, who resided with his mother, was not excluded as a driver under the policy and', '-2- that, therefore, the policy provisions were ambiguous and the ambiguity should be resolved in her favor. The defendant further argued that Calvin was negligent in leasing the vehicle for Jared‟s use and that because Calvin was a named driver under the policy, there should be coverage. Finally, defendant asserted that the exclusion was contrary to public policy and that Allstate should not benefit because, according to defendant, Allstate‟s agent improperly wrote the insurance policies for Calvin and Cheryl.', 'The trial justice entertained argument on both motions on May 24, 2011, and issued a bench decision in which she determined that the non-owned auto exclusion under Cheryl‟s policy was clear and unambiguous.', 'The trial justice stated that the following facts were undisputed: Cheryl did not own the Cadillac driven by Jared; Jared was a resident relative of Cheryl‟s; Jared was insured to drive the Cadillac; and the Cadillac was available to Jared and furnished for his regular use. In light of these undisputed facts, the trial justice was satisfied that the exclusion applied and that the accident in which Ahlquist was injured and the claims arising from it were not covered by Cheryl‟s insurance policy. The trial justice also found that the non- owned vehicle exclusion did not conflict with the declaration that there were no excluded drivers under Cheryl‟s policy. Finally, the trial justice held that the exclusion did not violate public policy. Accordingly, the trial justice granted summary judgment in Allstate‟s favor and denied defendant‟s motion for summary judgment. An order was entered on June 1, 2011, and final judgment was entered on August 30, 2011.', 'Before this Court, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment because Calvin, who was a named driver under Cheryl‟s insurance policy, provided the Cadillac to Jared. The defendant also argues that there is ambiguity as to whether the policy', '-3- covers the accident. According to defendant, Jared was not an excluded driver because the declarations page listed “[n]one” in the section for excluded drivers.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Moore v.

Here, however, the material facts of this case are undisputed, and the issue before us is one of contract interpretation. This Court employs a de novo review of such questions of law.

Quigley, 118 R.I. 321, 326, 373 A.2d 810, 812 (1977)).', 'The defendant argues that Jared was not an excluded driver under Cheryl‟s policy and that that circumstance, combined with the policy‟s provision extending coverage to members of Cheryl‟s household, gives rise to an ambiguity in the policy provisions. Therefore, according to defendant, the exclusionary language cannot apply to relieve plaintiff of its obligations under Cheryl‟s policy.', 'The undisputed operative facts are these: Jared lived with his mother at the time of the accident; he was operating a vehicle that was not owned by Jared but had been furnished to him for his regular use; and the Cadillac was not a covered vehicle under Cheryl‟s policy. Thus, the only question before us is one of contract interpretation—a question of law. Our de novo review of that issue confirms that the clear and unambiguous vehicle-exclusion provision under the policy clearly applies to these facts. The exclusion in the policy relates to the vehicle and not the driver.', '-5-', 'The terms of Cheryl‟s policy provide that a non-owned automobile will be covered if it was used by the policyholder or a resident relative with the owner‟s permission, but it also provides that the automobile “must not be available or furnished for the regular use of an insured person.” Jared‟s use of the Cadillac clearly falls within this exclusion: as a “resident-relative,” Jared is considered an insured person per the definition under the policy; however, he used the vehicle on a regular basis. Thus, the policy language excluding vehicles furnished for the regular use of an insured person applies in this case. This exclusion does not, as defendant contends, conflict with the declarations page of the policy, which declares that there are no specific drivers excluded under the policy. In this case, it is the vehicle that is excluded, not the driver. Because we discern no ambiguity in these provisions, “we shall not depart from the literal language of the policy” and decline to “engag[e] in mental gymnastics * * * to read ambiguity into [this] policy where none is present.”', 'Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 11 A.3d at 649 (quoting Lynch, 965 A.2d at 425).', 'Having examined the policy in its entirety, and applying the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy language, it is our conclusion that the exclusion provision is not ambiguous. We are satisfied that defendant‟s construction of the policy perceives an ambiguity in the provision where none exists.', 'Finally, the defendant argues that, because both policies were issued by Allstate, Allstate had actual knowledge of “all issues” pertaining to coverage. In effect, comparing the two policies, the defendant asks this Court to impute an improper intention by Allstate to exploit the facts and create a gap in coverage. Having examined the record before us, we reject this contention.', '-6-', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

91,State : v. : Gerardo E. Martinez. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, Gerardo E. Martinez (Martinez or defendant), appeals from a conviction of murder in the first degree and an imposition by the trial justice of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On appeal, he contends that the trial justice committed reversible error in (1) admitting acts of prior misconduct that he allegedly committed against the decedent; (2) denying his motion for a new trial; and (3) sentencing him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we discern no error on the part of the trial justice and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In October 2005, a grand jury indicted Martinez on charges of first-degree murder in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5 1 (count 1) and driving a motor vehicle without consent of the owner in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-9-1 (count 2). 2 After Martinez 1', 'In pertinent part, G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5(a) applies to “[e]very person convicted of * * * a crime involving domestic violence * * *.” 2', 'The defendant does not contest his conviction on count 2 in this appeal.', '-1- pleaded not guilty to the charges, the Attorney General filed a notice of intent to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if Martinez were convicted of first-degree murder, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19.2-3.', 'Over the course of an eight-day trial, the prosecution presented twenty-five witnesses who testified to the following facts. At the outset, we acknowledge that many of these facts are graphic and disturbing. We recite them in necessary detail because they are relevant to our evaluation of whether (1) the crime amounted to murder in the first degree and (2) the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate.', 'Lindsay Ann Burke, the decedent, graduated from Rhode Island College in May 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in special and elementary education. At the time of her death, Lindsay3 was employed by Opportunities Unlimited, where she was responsible for assisting disabled adults living in group homes.', 'Lindsay met Martinez while attending a wedding in September 2003. They started dating shortly thereafter. Her mother, Anna Burke, testified that “[she] could tell [Lindsay] was swept off her feet” when she met Martinez “and [that Lindsay] was on cloud nine.” Anna recalled her first impression of Martinez: “He was very polite. He was soft spoken. * * * He was very respectful.” However, she testified that her opinion of Martinez later changed and that her relationship with Lindsay soon became strained when she told Lindsay that she “no longer approved” of Martinez.', 'In March 2004, while she was still a student at Rhode Island College, Lindsay moved out of her parents’ home to live with Martinez. Anna testified that she continued to see Lindsay “approximately once a week”—usually on Sundays, for dinner. When Martinez eventually 3', 'This Court means no disrespect by referring to some individuals in this opinion by their first names. It is for clarity purposes only that first names are used throughout this opinion.', '-2- blocked Anna’s phone number from calling his home, Anna continued to communicate with Lindsay on her cell phone. According to Anna, in March 2005, Lindsay became “displeased” with her relationship with Martinez and moved back into her parents’ home. Nonetheless, Lindsay “continued to take [Martinez’s] phone calls and talk to him.” By June 2005, Lindsay was staying at Martinez’s home six nights a week. She once again moved out of her parents’ home to live with Martinez “sometime” in July 2005.', 'Around the third week of August 2005, Lindsay told Anna that “she was probably going to leave [Martinez] * * * and move out of his house * * *.” Lindsay told her that she had met somebody else—a man named Chris, who worked as a cook at the Cranston Senior Center. This man was later determined to be Christopher Barrett.', 'At trial, Barrett testified that he met Lindsay in May 2005.', 'At that time, he was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) for a second-degree robbery conviction, and he worked at the Cranston Senior Center on work release. At the time of trial, Barrett had an extensive criminal record, which was related to the jury during his testimony. After meeting Lindsay, they soon developed a friendship. Barrett testified that Lindsay would visit him three to four times a week during visiting hours at the ACI. Barrett testified that he wrote her letters and notes—about fifteen in total—and that he and Lindsay grew close and loved each other. He also gave her some photographs of himself, in which he posed as a “body-builder.” In addition, Barrett gave her about $1,300 while he was incarcerated at the ACI.', 'According to Barrett, Lindsay had told him that she was involved in a relationship with Martinez and that she was “very unhappy.”', 'Barrett then testified, over defense counsel’s objections pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, that Lindsay told him that Martinez “had been physically abusive on more than one occasion, that he was very', '-3- controlling, [and] that he had alienated her.” 4 Lindsay never told Barrett specifically where on her body Martinez had hit her, only that “he was really smart and he knew how to * * * do it in ways where it would be covered by clothing.” She also told Barrett that she was going to leave Martinez and move in with her brother, Christopher Burke.', 'Lindsay’s supervisor at Opportunities Unlimited, Katherine Baxter, also testified at trial. Defense counsel also objected to her testimony on Rule 404(b) grounds. Baxter testified that she and Lindsay developed a close personal relationship during April 2005. Baxter confided in Lindsay that she was “depressed” about her recent breakup. Lindsay then opened up to her about her own relationship with Martinez. Lindsay told Baxter that her relationship with Martinez was “turbulent [and that] there was abuse, verbal[ ] and physical.” Lindsay confided that “he would twist her arm behind her back” and that he once “punched her in her right thigh over and over.” On a different occasion, Baxter noticed that Lindsay had “a red mark on her face” which was “circular” and “near * * * her mouth.” Lindsay told Baxter that Martinez had “hit her.”', 'Lindsay eventually moved in with her brother, Christopher, in late August 2005. Anna testified that she last saw Lindsay at Christopher’s North Kingstown home on September 11, 2005. A few days later, on September 14, 2005, Anna recalled receiving a phone call from Christopher, in which he told her that Lindsay was uncharacteristically not responding to his phone calls. Anna testified that she then called Lindsay’s cell phone, left her a message, called the Warwick police to report Lindsay missing, and then drove to Martinez’s home. She further testified that she called Lindsay’s employer.', 'Officer John McHale of the Warwick Police Department testified that he was dispatched at around 4:16 p.m. that afternoon in response to Anna’s phone call. He met with Anna and her 4', 'We elaborate on defense counsel’s objections pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence in Part III-A, infra.', '-4- husband, Lindsay’s father, at a location next door to Martinez’s home in Warwick. Anna told him that Lindsay had not shown up for work, and that they had not spoken in a couple of days, which, according to Anna, was “highly unusual.” He also found out that Lindsay had been involved with Martinez.', 'At that point, McHale walked over to Martinez’s home, located at 1917 Warwick Avenue. He checked the registration on the pickup truck parked in the driveway and learned that the vehicle was registered to Martinez at that address. He then knocked on the front door, which proved futile. He noted that the front door was locked and the shades were drawn. He then told the Burkes that he “would keep a check” on Martinez’s home throughout the night.', 'He instructed the Burkes to contact the North Kingstown police to report Lindsay as a missing person, because Lindsay actually resided at her brother’s home in that town.', 'McHale was again dispatched to Martinez’s home at approximately 5:40 p.m. that afternoon. McHale had learned that the New Hampshire State Police had found Lindsay’s vehicle and that it had recently been involved in an accident. The operator of the vehicle was identified as Martinez. 5 The New Hampshire State Police informed McHale that Martinez had cut himself in an attempted suicide and that he was “unconscious when they located him” inside the vehicle. He told McHale that they had also found a suicide note in the vehicle, signed by Martinez, which stated in relevant part that “[s]he f***ed me over. I didn’t want to kill her but I did.” 6 5', 'Martinez was found inside Lindsay’s vehicle at a rest area in New Hampshire, after the vehicle hit a tree. A rest-area attendant found Martinez alone inside, vomiting. She then dialed 911. He eventually fell out of the car and collapsed before the police arrived. 6', 'The entirety of the suicide note was read into evidence at trial by Trooper Sean Faherty of the New Hampshire State Police.', '-5-', 'In light of this new information, McHale’s supervisor ordered him to return to Martinez’s home. When he arrived, Martinez’s mother, Elizabeth Belina, was just exiting her vehicle. She told him that she was there to “check on her son since she hadn’t heard from him and he also did not show up for work.” They waited a few minutes for other officers to arrive. Belina gave the officers her key to Martinez’s home, which they then entered. McHale testified that he walked directly to the back of the residence, while the two other officers with him went to other sections of the home. He first saw the bathroom door, which was closed. He recalled that he saw dried blood on the doorknob, and that there were droplets of blood on the floor as well as on the door itself. Another officer, wearing gloves, then opened that door. When McHale stepped into the bathroom, he “immediately notice[d] * * * a large amount of blood, a pool of blood on the floor, * * * [and] blood on the tub.”', 'He then found Lindsay’s bloodied body in the bathtub covered with a blanket. He noted that the glass doors of the tub and shower were “off the track” and leaning into the tub. He then immediately went to the front of the house to secure the front door, and he started a crime scene log. He maintained his post at the front door until approximately 11:45 p.m., at which time he left and completed his police report.', 'Detective Daniel Gillis (Det. Gillis), a member of the BCI Unit of the Warwick Police Department, testified that he was called to Martinez’s home around 6 p.m. that evening. He arrived with Det. Walter Williams (Det. Williams), another BCI Unit member. They waited outside Martinez’s home until a search warrant was issued at around 10 p.m. that night. Detective Gillis then photographed the scene inside the home and made a sketch of its layout. At trial, he described the numerous photographs he had taken at Martinez’s home that night. In the living room, there was a blood stain on the couch cushion and several blood drops on the floor.', '-6- He testified that there was a pink pocketbook, a black billfold, and a three-and-a-half inch knife on the couch in the living room. The black billfold contained Lindsay’s driver’s license, among other items.', 'In the bathroom, he photographed a knife on the vanity counter. The knife blade was stained with blood and contained strands of hair. He also photographed personal items found in the sink, including a photograph of “a male subject [wearing] khaki pants, no shirt,” 7 as well as various checks payable to Lindsay from her employer. He photographed a blood splatter on the mini-blind, “an arc of blood” on the back wall, and “blood * * * coming up the toilet, on the rim of the toilet and, also, in the bowl.” Additionally, he photographed a stuffed animal, recognized as “Scooby Doo,” which was found on top of Lindsay’s body in the bathtub.', 'Carl Zambrano, an investigator from the medical examiner’s office, arrived shortly thereafter. Although Zambrano did not testify at trial, Det. Gillis testified to what he himself observed.', 'He stated that he watched Zambrano remove the blanket covering Lindsay’s unclothed body. The transport team from the medical examiner’s office then removed Lindsay’s body from the bathtub. While Zambrano began his investigation and checked Lindsay’s body, Det. Gillis continued to take photographs. He photographed a “large laceration to the back of her neck,” “large lacerations” on her chest, “bruising to the face area,” and other wounds to her body.', 'As noted above, Det. Williams also responded to Martinez’s home that evening. At trial, he was qualified as an expert in both fingerprints and blood stain analysis. He testified that there was a blood stain on the couch in the living room and bloody clothes in both the kitchen and the bathroom. He identified fingerprints belonging to Lindsay on various papers in the bathroom. 7', 'The shirtless man pictured in the photograph was later determined to be Christopher Barrett.', '-7- However, he was unable to develop any identifiable fingerprints on the photograph of Barrett, which was found on the bathroom vanity. He testified that there were “transfer patterns of blood overlapping the lip of the * * * sink” in the bathroom, which he identified as originating from Lindsay’s hand.', 'Further, Det. Williams observed blood stains on the wall in the bathroom. The shape of the blood stains led him to conclude that they were the result of “arterial spurts.” He testified that, from his observations of the arc patterns of blood on the wall, “the blood from [Lindsay’s] artery was not being ejected from one spot. It appear[ed] that the artery was also moving and projecting blood and it was spattering the blood on the surface at a perpendicular angle.” He noted that the wastebasket in the bathroom was full of rolled-up toilet paper with transfers of “small, significant amount[s] of blood” consistent with a minor injury, such as a nosebleed. He also testified that the bathroom floor contained a “large volume of blood.” He concluded that blood had spattered from many different directions.', 'He further determined that, based on the amount of blood present in the bathroom, the fatal injury to Lindsay occurred in the bathroom. He stated that any injuries suffered in the living room occurred prior to the fatal bathroom injury, but he could not state with certainty how much time had elapsed between her various injuries.', 'Sharon Mallard, an employee of the Rhode Island Department of Health at the Forensic Biology Laboratory, performed DNA analysis on the evidence collected by the police at the crime scene.', 'She testified that Lindsay’s DNA matched the blood on a T-shirt found in Martinez’s bathroom, the men’s jeans in the kitchen, the women’s sneakers, the women’s pants from the bathroom, the men’s sneakers, the bear-claw knife in the bathroom, the tissues in the', '-8- wastebasket, and a cutting of the stain from the living-room couch. She also found Martinez’s DNA under one of Lindsay’s fingernails. 8', 'Peter Gillespie, M.D., an assistant medical examiner for the Rhode Island Department of Health, also testified at trial. He was qualified as an expert in forensic pathology. He testified that he performed an autopsy of Lindsay’s body on September 15, 2005. He first examined Lindsay’s hands, which had been bagged to preserve evidence. He noticed “traumatic injuries on [her] hands,” which were “bloody.” He noted that there “appeared to be a bloody material underneath [her] fingernails.” He further testified that there were three contusions on her forehead and that her nose was “extensively fractured.” He stated that it was unlikely that all three contusions were caused by one blow, since each was on a different area of her forehead. He thus concluded that each contusion was caused by “a single contact with her forehead”— “something striking her forehead or her forehead striking something.”', 'Doctor Gillespie further testified that on the left side of Lindsay’s neck was a “very large incised wound, very deep” which had cut the carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the trachea. In addition to the incised wound, he also noted a stab wound on her neck. He noted that there were “traumatic injuries present on [her] right upper chest” which consisted of “two punctate puncture wounds.” She also had a superficial incised wound on her right leg.', 'There were eight contusions present on Lindsay’s skull, which, according to Dr. Gillespie, occurred while Lindsay was still alive. He determined that the cause of death was “massive hemorrhage due to sharp force wounds of the left carotid artery and the left jugular vein.” He testified that Lindsay remained alive for a period of time after the fatal wound 8', 'Detective Eric Johnson of the Warwick Police Department testified that he drove to New Hampshire to interview Martinez on the night of September 14, 2005. While he was there, he took photographs of Martinez, which revealed scratch marks on the side of his stomach, as well as lacerations on his forearms.', '-9- occurred. 9 He further determined that the manner of death was homicide. He testified that the time of death occurred “probably [twenty-four to thirty-six] hours” prior to the time he performed the autopsy, which was 9:45 a.m. on September 15, 2005.', 'The vice president of Coastway Credit Union was also subpoenaed to testify at trial. A printout of the daily transactions at Coastway Credit Union, located on Warwick Avenue, revealed that on September 13, 2005 at 11:56 a.m., Martinez withdrew $500 from the drive-up ATM. This was further corroborated by the bank’s own video surveillance.', 'A warranted search of Martinez’s home computer performed by the Warwick police further revealed that between 12:43 p.m. and 12:59 p.m. on September 13, 2005, Martinez conducted Internet searches pertaining to gun shops, gun shows, and waiting periods for gun purchases in New Hampshire. At 1:31 p.m. that day, Martinez then videotaped a statement in which he apologized for what he had done to Lindsay and said goodbye to his family. In his statement, he further said, “I’ll never understand what happened to me. The rage that just filled me in a split second to make me do what I did that I did. I’m sorry but I apologize. I know that’s not enough.”', 'After making the videotape, Martinez eventually drove Lindsay’s vehicle to New Hampshire. As previously stated, a rest-area attendant in New Hampshire found Martinez alone inside Lindsay’s vehicle. 10 The New Hampshire State Police seized several items from the vehicle.', 'The vehicle and the seized items were then transported to the Warwick Police Department. Detectives Williams and Gillis responded to examine the vehicle for evidence. Detective Williams testified that the seized items included: a blood-stained towel, cards and 9', 'On redirect examination, he testified that this period of time lasted for about “five or ten minutes.” 10', 'See note 5, supra.', '- 10 - letters sent to Lindsay from Barrett, photographs of a shirtless Barrett, a list of visiting hours at the ACI, a Scooby Doo Father’s Day card from Lindsay to Martinez, 11 a white notepad containing Martinez’s suicide note, and a white three-ring binder belonging to Martinez, which contained his various certificates of achievement and photographs of Lindsay and him.', 'Martinez’s suicide note, which was found inside the vehicle, included the following statement:', '“I found out that Linds was talking to someone * * * so she', 'was cheating on me. * * * I found love letters. * * * I snapped.

I went crazy, crazy. * * *', 'The girl that stopped me from killing Diane was the one that', 'f***ed me over.” He also wrote that he “felt like [he] went insane.” He wrote that he was “so sorry for everything especially for what [he] just did to Lindsay and all the families.”', 'Detective Eric Johnson of the Warwick Police Department testified that he arrived in New Hampshire just after midnight on September 15, 2005. He then gave Martinez his Miranda warnings and interviewed him. The video recording of this interview was played for the jury at trial. In the interview, when asked “what happened back at your house,” Martinez stated that he and Lindsay “got into an argument, and I said f*** this I’m out of here * * *.”', 'Following the state’s case-in-chief, defense counsel introduced an exhibit—a photograph of the back seat of Lindsay’s car when it was discovered by the New Hampshire State Police in the rest area. Defense counsel then rested. After several hours of deliberations, a Kent County Superior Court jury returned a verdict finding Martinez guilty of both first-degree murder and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner. 11', 'Anna testified that the writing on the card was, in fact, Lindsay’s handwriting.', '- 11 -', 'After this verdict, the trial justice instructed the jury to decide whether the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Martinez’s murder of Lindsay involved either aggravated battery or torture. 12 In his instructions to the jury, the trial justice defined aggravated battery as “the malicious causing of bodily harm to a victim while that victim was still alive by seriously disfiguring the body of that person * * *.” The trial justice also instructed the jury that torture “requires evidence of serious physical or mental abuse of the victim while that victim was still alive and conscious.” After further deliberation, the jury found that the murder was committed with both aggravated battery and torture to Lindsay. Thereafter, Martinez moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice denied that motion.', 'Based on § 12-19.2-1, the trial justice then conducted a presentence hearing, at which the Attorney General and the defense were permitted “to present additional evidence relevant to a determination of the sentence.” At this hearing, defense counsel presented the testimony of Ronald M. Stewart, M.D., an experienced clinical and forensic psychiatrist. Doctor Stewart testified that he had recently interviewed Martinez at the ACI in the presence of a social worker. He then issued a ten-page report of his findings to the court.', 'Doctor Stewart testified that he reviewed Martinez’s personal background, which was shaped by a history of abuse at the hands of his father, as well as a traumatic experience in the Navy. After reviewing his personal history and also conducting an interview with Martinez, Dr. Stewart diagnosed Martinez with “[p]ost-traumatic stress, chronic major depressive disorder, and panic disorder, [and] also alcohol abuse disorder.”', 'He testified that Martinez was “very 12', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-23-2 permits a trial justice to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole based on the jury’s finding that either of these two elements was present.', '- 12 - intelligent, very insightful and very contrite regarding his crime, very remorseful about it, and would work diligently to try to repair the damage to himself.” He opined that, with prescribed medication and counseling, Martinez’s condition would “[c]ertainly” improve, such that he could be “rehabilitated” and could “abide by the norms of society.” Moreover, Dr. Stewart testified that, in his opinion, Martinez “would not be a recidivist” if paroled to society after serving a lengthy term in prison.', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Stewart acknowledged that, in formulating his psychiatric opinion of Martinez, he had taken into consideration Martinez’s history of domestic violence. However, he testified that he did not review the videotape Martinez made of himself shortly after murdering Lindsay.', 'Martinez also addressed the court at this hearing. In significant part, he stated:', '“I take full responsibility for the murder of Lindsay Ann Burke.

Williams in finding that the blood spatter patterns in the bathroom showed that Lindsay “fought ferociously to defend herself during the assault.”', 'With respect to torture, the trial justice found that “[t]he horror that Lindsay Ann Burke experienced at the hands of this defendant which she had to endure for some minutes before her ultimate death while futilely fighting for her survival clearly constitutes torture of the cruelest nature.” He further found that “[Lindsay’s] enduring the multiple abrasions, punctures, stab wounds and slashing has manifestly shown aggravated battery in the inordinate number of wounds she experienced while being in a conscious state.”', 'Further, the trial justice found that “[a]ny mitigation accruing to the defendant because of his age, his military service and lack of prior criminal record are subsumed in his lack of true remorse or acceptance of responsibility * * * of his actions.” The trial justice characterized Martinez’s anger, alleged lack of sleep, and medical status as “shallow attempts to blame others” for what he had done. He stated that Martinez’s potential for rehabilitation “is extremely poor,” especially in light of the domestic abuse he had previously imposed on the mothers of his two children. He further noted that domestic violence “continue[s] to increase and the rate of recidivism among perpetrators, in this [c]ourt’s view, is nothing short of alarming.” With that in mind, he stated that “[t]his sentence ought to clearly be a deterrent to others who may be similarly situated * * *,” although he acknowledged that the court “doubt[ed] its effectiveness or ability to curb or lessen these criminal activities.” 13 13', 'As a result of efforts undertaken by Lindsay’s family and other domestic violence awareness advocates after her murder, the General Assembly enacted the Lindsay Ann Burke Act, which is aimed at preventing and addressing dating violence in all of the state’s school districts.

Martinez then timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Martinez advances three arguments to support his appeal. First, Martinez challenges the trial justice’s admission of certain testimony from two witnesses: Barrett and Baxter. Specifically, he avers that their testimony about his alleged prior abuse of Lindsay was inadmissible under Rule 404(b). Secondly, Martinez challenges the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial. He contends that the jury was wrong in concluding that the homicide amounted to murder in the first degree rather than murder in the second degree. Lastly, Martinez maintains that his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was unwarranted. Martinez urges this Court, in the event we uphold his conviction, to reduce his sentence to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.', 'In countering Martinez’s contentions, the state argues that the trial justice properly admitted the Rule 404(b) testimony since it related to Martinez’s intent and motive, which are both permissible purposes under that rule. The state also argues that the trial justice properly denied Martinez’s motion for a new trial, pointing out that the trial justice adequately explained his reasons for agreeing with the jury’s verdict and validly determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the intent necessary for murder in the first degree.

He maintains that such evidence was strictly propensity evidence and that therefore, its admission violated Rule 404(b). The state maintains that this testimony was properly admitted because it related to Martinez’s intent and motive and provided the jury with the complete story of the circumstances surrounding the murder. The state argues that this evidence belies the theory of second-degree murder proffered by the defense.', 'Martinez articulated a similar argument at the pretrial hearing on his motion in limine to exclude such evidence. The state countered that exclusion of testimony relating to Martinez’s prior abuse would cause the jury to view the evidence of Lindsay’s murder in a “vacuum” and wrongly conclude that this was a “rare instance” in which Martinez “snapped” and “acted on his emotions.”', 'We recognize that “[t]he line between Rule 404(b) evidence presented for the impermissible purpose of demonstrating propensity and Rule 404(b) evidence presented for one of the specific non-propensity exceptions is ‘both a fine one to draw and an even more difficult one for judges and juries to follow.’” Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150 (quoting State v.

Expressing a “very deep concern about the volatility of this type of testimony when exposed to a jury,” the trial justice stated that any admitted Rule 404(b) evidence “must be extremely detailed and curtailed by the prosecution to elicit only the nearest minimum testimony necessary * * *.”', 'Although the trial justice did not allow the state to introduce all of the requested Rule 404(b) testimony into evidence, 15 he did allow the state to introduce testimony from Baxter and Barrett about direct communications from Lindsay concerning specific instances of physical abuse by Martinez.

The trial justice also excluded a letter written by Lindsay and addressed to Martinez, in which she referred to enduring Martinez’s abuse. The letter was unspecific about whether the abuse was physical or emotional. The trial justice determined that, “in light of the fact that the [c]ourt is going to admit [other] [Rule] 404(b) evidence,” the letter “[was] manifestly less relevant.” As such, the trial justice ruled that the letter was inadmissible.', '- 18 - defense counsel sought to convince the jury that the evidence amounted to second-degree murder, supported by Martinez’s statement that he “snapped,” the trial justice determined that the Rule 404(b) testimony was “reasonably appropriate” for the jury to consider. According to the trial justice, the Rule 404(b) testimony wove into the “fabric of the fact pattern” leading up to the murder and therefore should not be excluded.', 'Additionally, the trial justice considered the Rule 404(b) evidence in conjunction with Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which states that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” The trial justice determined that “while prejudicial [to Martinez,] [the Rule 404(b) evidence] does not in any regard outweigh the probative value of the information to the jury.”', 'Further, with respect to any other Rule 404(b) testimony that the state sought to introduce, the trial justice cautioned that “the [c]ourt is going to be extremely, extremely guarded as to the nature and extent of the testimony that it will allow with regard to [Martinez’s alleged abuse against Lindsay].” At trial, the state did not introduce any Rule 404(b) testimony other than that offered by Barrett and Baxter.', 'Furthermore, the trial justice issued limiting instructions to the jury directly following the testimony of both Barrett and Baxter, as well as a third time at the close of the case. 16 We note 16', 'After first explaining to the jurors that they were not to consider the Rule 404(b) evidence as propensity evidence, the trial justice instructed the jurors that they could consider such evidence “if [they] think it’s important,” and “if it tends in [their] mind[s] to establish possible motive, intent, or the absence of mistake * * *” in this case. Further, he stated that the jurors could consider the evidence to determine whether “the defendant had formed a specific intent to commit the crimes charged in this case or to show that the defendant acted knowingly and', ""- 19 - that “the members of the jury are presumed to follow the trial justice's instructions.” State v.

According to Martinez, “reasonable minds could not differ” in reaching a conclusion that this was murder in the second degree.', 'According to Martinez, the evidence shows that the murder was “not an act of willful deliberation,” but rather a “crime of passion.” To support this argument, Martinez highlights certain portions of his suicide note and his videotaped confession, in which he states that he “snapped,” “went crazy,” and that “rage * * * just filled [him] in a split second to make [him] do what [he] did * * *.” As Martinez argued in his motion for a new trial, he maintains on appeal that “it is a fair inference * * * that he went through Lindsay Burke’s purse, saw the photographs and/or love letters, became very enraged or upset, walked in, saw her and committed this dastardly act”—a scenario that, in his view, squarely constitutes second-degree murder.', '- 21 -', 'Section 11-23-1 defines murder as “[t]he unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought * * *.” That same statute defines first-degree murder as, among other things, “[e]very murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing * * *.” Id. “Any other murder is murder in the second degree.” Id.

Vorgvongsa, 692 A.2d 1194, 1196 (R.I. 1997)).

Here, the evidence shows that Lindsay’s murder took time to complete. The medical examiner testified that Lindsay was alive for the duration of the assault; and, even after the fatal wound was inflicted, her death was not instantaneous. 18 The evidence overwhelmingly shows that this terrible struggle lasted for more than a mere moment—which is time enough for Martinez to have premeditated his heinous murder of Lindsay.', 'Moreover, we point out that defense counsel was not precluded from arguing to the jury—and, in fact, did argue—that the element of premeditation was absent from this murder. During his closing argument, defense counsel argued that, upon finding the shirtless photo of Barrett in Lindsay’s purse, Martinez was “unable to control his emotions” and “los[t] it for a short period of time.” Defense counsel further proffered that Martinez was dejected when he found the photograph linking Lindsay to the heart of another man.', 'Martinez, then, just “snapped.” The jury, however, rejected this argument. As the trial justice indicated in denying Martinez’s motion for a new trial, defense counsel merely “suggest[ed] a set of inferences in his argument,” which the jury was free to accept or reject.', 'We emphasize that both the state and defense counsel had ample opportunity to present to the jury their respective versions of what transpired during the murder.

We note that, although the jury found that the murder was committed with both aggravated battery and torture, only one of these factors would have sufficed for Martinez to be eligible for a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 20', 'This Court has explained that “the terms torture and aggravated battery are words of common usage.” McManus, 941 A.2d at 236 (citing State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 323 (R.I. 1990)). We have stated that the term “aggravated battery * * * convey[s] to a juror of ordinary intelligence an image of a beating or infliction of traumatic force that is greater than necessary in order to render a victim helpless or to subject the victim to the will of the aggressor.” Travis, 568 A.2d at 323. The term “torture * * * convey[s] a similar meaning of inflicting pain and 20', 'We further note that, in her oral argument to this Court, defense counsel conceded that the murder involved both aggravated battery and torture.

We agree with the trial justice that “[t]he horror that Lindsay * * * experienced at the hands of this defendant which she had to endure for some minutes before her ultimate death while futilely fighting for her survival clearly constitutes torture of the cruelest nature.” Likewise, we agree with the trial justice that “[Lindsay’s] enduring the multiple abrasions, punctures, stab wounds and slashing has manifestly shown aggravated battery in the inordinate number of wounds she experienced while being in a conscious state.” Lindsay was savagely beaten, while trying to defend herself to save her life. Even when Martinez dealt her the final, fatal blow, Lindsay did not die instantly. Instead, she remained alive for some time before her untimely passing. 21', 'After independently determining that Lindsay’s murder involved aggravated battery and torture, we now proceed to determine whether Martinez’s character and propensities warrant the imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. See McManus, 941 A.2d at 238. In so doing, this Court looks to “any aggravating circumstances as well as any mitigating factors.” State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 24 (R.I. 2012) (citing State v.

Through his testimony, we learned that Martinez graduated from a vocational high school program in Cranston, where he participated in soccer and wrestling. Martinez then honorably served in the United States Navy for five years, during which he received military honors. After his honorable discharge in 2001, he gained employment as a civilian radar technician and also purchased a home. He is the father of two young children, and he did not have a criminal record prior to this murder.', 'As a young child, Martinez was the victim of domestic abuse inflicted by his father. He was also sexually molested by various babysitters. Additionally, his service in the Navy was traumatic. Upon his discharge, he sought counseling, and was treated with medication, which he tended to overtake. He abused alcohol, and suffered nightmares about his military experiences. As a result of his nightmares, he was able to sleep only two to three hours per night.', 'At the hearing, Dr. Stewart testified that after interviewing Martinez at the ACI, he concluded that Martinez was “very intelligent, very insightful and very contrite regarding his crime, very remorseful about it, and would work diligently to try to repair the damage to himself.”', '- 29 -', 'Doctor Stewart diagnosed Martinez with post-traumatic stress, chronic major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol abuse disorder. According to Dr. Stewart, these diagnoses “could all cause [Martinez] to act impulsively[,] to have [a] somewhat marginal understanding of what he was doing, [and] to not behave rationally at times.”', 'Doctor Stewart was “reasonably certain” that Martinez could be rehabilitated and “abide by the norms of society” with prescribed medication and counseling. He further testified that the medication and counseling necessary for Martinez to be rehabilitated would be available to him at the ACI. Doctor Stewart did not believe that Martinez would be a recidivist if paroled to society after serving a lengthy prison term.', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Stewart acknowledged Martinez’s lengthy history as a violent domestic abuser, testifying that Martinez was “no stranger to domestic abuse.”', 'He acknowledged that Martinez had “forced [his former wife] to perform oral sex upon him and [had] kicked her in the head with a steel-toed boot.” He further acknowledged on cross- examination that he was aware of other occasions on which Martinez had engaged in domestic violence, including an incident when he forced his young son to stay on his knees for extended periods of time while Martinez yelled obscenities close to his son’s face. He stated that there is a “terrible disconnect”—“a type of Dr. Jeckel [sic] and Mr. Hyde type thing where we have a monster one minute and then some point afterward, it gets resolved, and they say, ‘My God, what did I do?’” Doctor Stewart also acknowledged that “[d]omestically abused people who become abusers themselves without adequate treatment[—]long-term treatment[—]tend to [abuse] again * * *.”', 'In rendering his diagnosis and psychological opinion about the likelihood that Martinez could be rehabilitated, Dr. Stewart admitted on cross-examination that he did not review the', '- 30 - videotape that Martinez made of himself shortly after murdering Lindsay. Thus, at the time he rendered his report, Dr. Stewart was not familiar with Martinez’s demeanor in the immediate aftermath of the murder. Notwithstanding that, on redirect examination, Dr. Stewart testified that this new information would not change his opinion that Martinez would not be a recidivist.', 'Defense counsel also emphasizes Martinez’s testimony at the presentence hearing. In his allocution, Martinez stated: 22', '“* * * I * * * take full responsibility for the murder of Lindsay', 'Ann Burke. I am truly and sincerely sorry for my lack of self-', 'control on that morning. I respectfully beg for forgiveness from', 'Lindsay’s family and friends and bringing shame to my family—', 'for bringing shame in this unfortunate tragedy.

However, the state contends that Martinez’s suicide note, written immediately after murdering Lindsay, suggests otherwise. In this note, Martinez appeared to blame Lindsay, and not himself, for what happened. In the letter, he wrote: “I found out that Linds was talking to someone. * * * [S]o she was cheating on me. * * * She strai[gh]t lie[d] to me.” He also appeared to blame other women in his life for the murder, writing that he “had been f***ed over by [too] many 22', 'Martinez also made statements at the presentencing hearing casting Lindsay and her parents in a negative light.', '- 31 - women.” Further, he additionally blamed the murder on “what [he] went through when [he] was a kid, and the amount of time [he] got shot [at] in Kosovo [while in the Navy].” As such, according to the state, Martinez’s suicide note deflects blame away from himself, indicating that Martinez is not remorseful.', 'We further note that, in the presentence report, Martinez is quoted as stating that this was not murder in the first degree. He appeared to attribute blame for the murder on his lack of sleep and failure to take his medication. Additionally, he commented that when he and Lindsay began dating, Lindsay’s parents “gave up on her.” Because of this, he had to take care of her, which, according to Martinez, proved to them that he was “man enough” to do. He further stated that he felt sorry for Lindsay’s parents, since they never had the chance to apologize to her.', ""“[A] criminal defendant's prospects for rehabilitation should be a major consideration * * * when imposing sentence.” State v. Bertoldi, 495 A.2d 247, 253 (R.I. 1985). This Court has stated that the “many factors” involved in this consideration cannot all be “categorized or succinctly described.” Id. “These factors concern the defendant's attitude toward society, the remorse or guilt that a defendant may feel for having committed a crime, and his or her willingness and ability to take a place as an honest and useful member of society.” Id."", 'Here, we cannot ignore Dr. Stewart’s testimony, especially his opinion that Martinez is capable of rehabilitation after serving a lengthy prison sentence. However, this testimony must be weighed against Martinez’s own statements in which he assigns blame for this murder to sources other than himself. Although he has never denied that he committed the murder, he has pointed his finger at Lindsay, other women, his lack of sleep due to nightmares, his military trauma, his abusive father, Lindsay’s parents, and his misuse of medication, among other reasons, as scapegoats.', '- 32 -', 'Moreover, although Martinez does not have a prior criminal record, we are not convinced that he is capable of or willing to take a place as an honest and useful member of society. His history as a domestic abuser speaks volumes. During his allocution at the presentence hearing, Martinez denied that he had ever abused Lindsay before the murder. Additionally, in the presentence report, Martinez claimed that the day of the murder was the “one day” on which he failed to “take the high road.” These statements clearly show that Martinez had not taken responsibility for the domestic abuse he had inflicted not only upon Lindsay, but also upon two other women, as well as upon his own son.23 Furthermore, it is also telling that Martinez stated that he will “never understand” why he committed this murder nor “what happened to [him]” on that morning.', 'After carefully considering the record and exercising our own independent judgment and discretion, we are not persuaded to reduce Martinez’s sentence. Any mitigating factors, such as Martinez’s employment, lack of criminal record, young age, and honorable military service are far outweighed by the aggravating factors present in this case. Martinez viciously assaulted and murdered Lindsay, a woman whom he claims to have loved. He has failed to accept the entirety of the blame for her utterly senseless death. He has even failed to acknowledge and take responsibility for his own violent propensities with respect to other women he had relationships with. We therefore remain convinced that this terrible crime warrants the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the trial justice. 23', 'We note that in his allocution at the presentencing hearing, Martinez did state that he “[took] full responsibility for the murder.”', '- 33 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment imposed by the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 34 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

See id.', '-3-', 'Additionally, neither the WCC deposition nor the RIDE testimony could properly serve as the basis for a slander claim because Dr. Gallo’s statements in each instance were non- actionable by virtue of the testimonial privilege. This Court has recognized that, in certain circumstances, “it is more important that witnesses be free from the fear of civil liability for what they say than that a person who has been defamed by their testimony have a remedy.” See Ims v. Town of Portsmouth, 32 A.3d 914, 928 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). To that end, we have held that “statements made in judicial proceedings are privileged, and thus cannot form the basis for a defamation claim.”', 'See Western Mass. Blasting Corp. v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 783 A.2d 398, 403 n.3 (R.I. 2001); see also Ims, 32 A.3d at 927 (stating that “certain communications in connection with judicial proceedings are immune from suit because they enjoy an absolute privilege”). The privilege extends to testimony provided by a witness in a judicial proceeding.2 See O’Coin v. Woonsocket Institution Trust Co., 535 A.2d 1263, 1267 (R.I. 1988).', 'When defining the scope of the testimonial privilege, the term “judicial proceedings” has been held to refer to proceedings broader than those relating to traditional litigation.

Woonsocket Institution Trust Co., 535 A.2d 1263, 1267 (R.I. 1988), we stated that, under a rule adopted by a majority of jurisdictions, the testimonial privilege protects a witness’s testimony if the statements are both material and relevant, whereas the minority rule grants “a witness an unconditional privilege regarding testimony given.” While in O’Coin, we recognized that a testimonial privilege exists in Rhode Island, we declined to address the scope of that privilege because the testimony at issue in that case was protected under both the broad minority rule and the narrower majority rule. Id. Similarly, since Dr. Gallo’s testimony in both proceedings satisfies the more confined majority rule (discussed in footnotes 3 and 4, infra), we again “leave to another day the decision [regarding] which rule is applicable.” See id.; cf. Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (recognizing this Court’s “usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”).', '-4- make legal determinations.” See Ims, 32 A.3d at 928 (internal quotation marks omitted). The privilege also protects testimony offered in quasi-judicial proceedings. See Western Mass. Blasting Corp., 783 A.2d at 403 n.3 (“We now explicitly hold that, in accordance with the great weight of authority, statements made in quasi-judicial proceedings such as arbitrations shall be privileged against suits for defamation.”).', 'Doctor Gallo’s WCC deposition testimony was certainly provided “in connection with judicial proceedings.” The WCC is “a court of record with the same authority and power to subpoena and also the same authority and power to cite and punish for civil contempt as exist in the superior court.” See G.L. 1956 § 28-30-1(b). Since WCC actions are, without question, “judicial proceedings,” Dr. Gallo’s deposition testimony in that context cannot properly provide the basis for an actionable slander claim.3', 'Ms. Francis’s claim for slander based on Dr. Gallo’s RIDE testimony is similarly checkmated by well-recognized legal principles. We have recognized that RIDE hearing officers “schedule hearings, take evidence, consider the law, and participate in the issuance of decisions—all official functions comparable to those performed by a trial judge.”', 'See Richardson v.

See footnote 2, supra.', '-5- “judicial proceeding,” and it is accordingly immunized from defamation claims by the testimonial privilege.4', 'We afford witnesses the testimonial privilege in order “to encourage witnesses to come forward and speak freely about civil or criminal matters.” See Ims, 32 A.3d at 928. Doctor Gallo did just that; he was called as a witness in both proceedings, and he answered the questions that were posed to him. His statements cannot provide the basis for a defamation action.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The record in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court. 4', 'Similar to his analysis of the WCC testimony, the motion justice properly recognized that Dr. Gallo’s RIDE testimony was relevant to the wrongful termination hearing, noting that the testimony “contradicted Ms. Francis’ assertion that she was medically excused from work.” Again, this testimony therefore would be afforded protection under the narrower majority rule for testimonial privilege.

94,State : v. : Robert Burnham. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction after a jury found the defendant, Robert Burnham, guilty of two counts of second-degree child molestation. The defendant filed a motion for new trial, but on November 26, 2008, the trial justice issued a written decision in which he denied the motion. He then sentenced the defendant to a term of thirty years, six to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. Before this Court, the defendant asserts that the trial justice erred: (1) when he denied his motion for new trial, which motion was founded on a claim that he was deprived of pretrial access to certain relevant hospital records and police reports; (2) when he failed to properly instruct the jury on the issue of the voluntariness of his police statement; and (3) when he improperly limited his cross-examination of the complaining witness. Because we are of the opinion that the defendant’s arguments are without merit, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2006, defendant was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of second-degree child molestation and one count of first-degree child molestation. All counts involved a single female, and all counts were alleged to have occurred between January 1, 2006, and June 8, 2006. 1', 'Before trial began, defendant’s pretrial counsel issued a number of subpoenas under Rule 17(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, 2 seeking medical records of the complaining witness, Jane, 3 including records from Jane’s hospitalization at Butler Hospital. Pursuant to the subpoenas, records were returned to the motion justice from various social service and medical providers for in camera review by the motion justice. However, the motion justice did not review the records; rather, he followed his usual practice of allowing the attorneys 1', 'Our examination of the record is made somewhat more difficult by the fact that there were two justices of the Superior Court involved in this case, as well as a number of different defense counsel. For the purpose of clarity, we shall refer to the justice who handled the pretrial matters as the “motion justice,” and the justice who presided at trial and the posttrial motions as the “trial justice.”', 'Also, we will refer to the attorney who represented defendant before trial commenced as “pretrial counsel,” the attorney who represented defendant at trial as “trial counsel,” and the attorney who argued the posttrial motions as “posttrial counsel.” 2', 'Rule 17(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure states:', '“A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed', 'to produce the books, papers, documents, or tangible things', 'designated therein. The court on motion made promptly may quash', 'or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or', 'oppressive. The court may direct that books, papers, documents or', 'objects designated in the subpoena be produced before the court at', 'a time prior to the trial or prior to the time when they are to be', 'offered in evidence and may upon their production permit the', 'books, papers, documents or objects or portions thereof to be', 'inspected by the parties and their attorneys.” 3', 'To protect the privacy of the complaining witness, we have used a pseudonym.', '-2- to review the documents.', 'It seems clear from the record that pretrial counsel invested considerable time going through the records.', 'On February 5 and 6, 2008, a jury trial was conducted in the Superior Court, in which both Jane and a detective testified for the state. Jane explained that the allegations in the indictment all had occurred in 2006, when she was twelve years old.', 'She explained that defendant was a “friend of the family,” who once had had a relationship with her mother. She further testified that defendant owned a house and that defendant’s mother resided there with him. Jane said that she spent the night at defendant’s house on three separate occasions and that it was on those occasions that the three incidents occurred. According to Jane, each time she stayed at defendant’s house, she slept in defendant’s mother’s bedroom and she wore defendant’s mother’s pajamas.', 'At trial, Jane testified that the first time she slept at defendant’s house, she woke up to discover defendant on top of her while she was lying on her stomach. She explained that defendant had one hand near her neck and the other hand on his penis. According to her testimony, defendant then proceeded to pull her pajama bottoms down, and he placed his penis on her buttocks and vagina. She said that when he tried to insert his penis in her vagina, she moved her leg and he left the room.', 'During the second incident, Jane again was sleeping on her stomach, and she again awoke to find defendant on top of her. As he did in the first incident, defendant pulled her pajama bottoms down and placed his penis on her thigh, buttock, and vagina. She testified that when he tried to put his penis in her vagina, she moved and, as had occurred during the earlier occasion, he left the room.', '-3-', 'Before the third incident, Jane was at defendant’s house, but she informed him she did not want to stay overnight. He replied that he was not going to bring her home because the weather had created poor driving conditions, and her mother was unable to pick her up because she did not have a car. Jane went to sleep, but she woke up, this time on her back, and realized that defendant was pulling her pajama bottoms down and inserting his penis in her vagina. She felt a sharp pain and made a sound, at which time defendant ran back to his room. 4', 'Jane revealed to her best friend the molestation that had occurred, but she did not tell her mother right away “[b]ecause [Jane] used to watch America’s Most Wanted and * * * [she] thought they would come after [her].” She explained that after the third incident, her attitude toward defendant went “down hill” and that she would act “bad[ly]” around him and “[b]eat him up.” She said that at some point her mother asked her why she was behaving in this manner, and, at that time, she told her mother about the incidents. On June 8, 2006, her mother brought her to the Warwick Police Department to give a statement.', 'During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Jane a series of questions about a conversation Jane had with her mother about other sexual activity in which she may have been engaged, suggesting that this had led to the accusations that she made against defendant. The state objected to the line of inquiry, citing Rule 412 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, 5 and 4', 'During direct examination, Jane conceded that, during a meeting she had with the prosecutor the week before the trial, she had indicated that she had been wearing jeans when the third incident occurred, but the next day, she told the prosecutor that she had been wearing pajamas. She explained that the reason for this inconsistency was that she had had bad dreams about the incidents, and, in one of those nightmares, she was wearing jeans. 5', 'Rule 412 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides, in pertinent part:', '“If a defendant who is charged with the crime of sexual assault', 'intends to introduce proof that the complaining witness has', 'engaged in sexual activities with other persons, he or she shall give', 'notice of his or her intention to the court and the attorney for the', 'state. The notice shall be given prior to the introduction of any', '-4- the trial justice sustained the objection because defendant had failed to provide prior notice of his intention to introduce any evidence of Jane’s purported sexual activity.', 'The state then called Det. Timothy Grant of the Warwick Police Department, who had investigated the incidents in question. He explained that, after interviewing Jane, he and another officer went to defendant’s home and informed him that he was the subject of an investigation. The detectives requested that defendant accompany them to the Warwick Police Department to assist in the investigation. Detective Grant then said that when the officers offered defendant the option of either driving himself to the station or riding with them, defendant chose to travel with the detectives. On the way to the station, defendant asked “if the case involved [Jane],” even though the officers had not yet referred to Jane by name. The officers brought defendant to a ten-foot-by-ten-foot room and read his Miranda 6 rights to him. The defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights, and he signed his name and provided his address on the rights form.', 'Detective Grant testified that during the interview at the police station, defendant acknowledged that he was a friend of Jane’s family and that she had stayed overnight at his home on three occasions. Detective Grant observed that during the conversation about the sleepovers, defendant became nervous and fidgety and that he would not maintain eye contact with the officers. He also testified that defendant said that Jane had worn tight jeans each time she slept at his home, but that he later stated that he remembered Jane wearing his mother’s pajamas on one occasion.', 'evidence of such fact * * *. Upon receiving such notice, the court', 'shall order the defendant to make a specific offer of the proof that', 'he or she intends to introduce in support of this issue.” 6', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-5-', 'Detective Grant then explained that he revealed to defendant that Jane had provided the detectives with a police statement, and he informed defendant of what she had said in that statement. The defendant initially responded by asserting that he “never touched [Jane]” and that he had never been in the bedroom where Jane slept when she stayed overnight. To the contrary, defendant asserted that Jane had come into his bedroom and “came on to him,” asking him to massage her back and rub her hair. The defendant conceded that he was sexually attracted to Jane—although he knew she was only twelve—and said that if she had been thirteen years old he would have considered having sex with her.', 'Detective Grant noted that, as the interview continued, defendant made comments that he “didn’t want to bag himself” and that “if he had known [the detectives] were coming to talk to him, he would have prepared himself more for an interview.” Detective Grant also observed that defendant was becoming “more and more nervous visibly, * * * very fidgety in the chair, looking around, * * * and trembling slightly.”', 'Eventually, defendant conceded to the detectives that, on one occasion, he was having sexual thoughts about Jane and, at approximately 2:30 a.m., he went into the bedroom where she was sleeping. He said that he sat on the bed and watched her. He explained that he became aroused and rubbed against her through his shorts. He further admitted that he pulled Jane’s pajama bottoms down and that he “rubbed the inside of her thigh and may have rubbed against her vagina” with his hand. He swore to the officers that he did not penetrate Jane, but after the officers advised defendant about Jane’s “very detailed statement”—where she recalled him straddling her and attempting to place his penis inside her vagina—he responded, “I’m not saying she made it up,” and “[s]he’s a very smart girl.” The defendant then became teary-eyed and commented to Det. Grant that “if I touched her, I’m sorry.”', '-6-', 'At this point, after about two hours of being interviewed, defendant agreed to give a written statement. 7', 'Detective Grant testified that he wrote the statement himself because defendant was illiterate. Detective Grant testified that he went over small segments of the statement—one at a time—with defendant, writing them down and reading them back to him. 8 7', 'Pretrial counsel filed a motion to suppress defendant’s statement before the trial, but the motion justice denied the motion after he concluded that defendant’s statement had been voluntary. The motion justice provided support for his reasoning for this conclusion, including that (1) defendant asked police whether the investigation was about Jane even though the police did not mention her name; (2) defendant agreed to ride with the detectives to the police station; (3) defendant’s fidgety and nervous demeanor and behavior prior to giving the police statement; (4) defendant’s signature and initials on the Miranda rights form; (5) the atmosphere and conduct of the police officers during the interrogation; and (6) the method by which the written statement was taken. 8', 'The statement defendant gave is as follows:', '“I, Robert Burnham, have known [Jane’s] family for about seven', 'years. I dated [Jane’s mother] for about five months several years', 'ago. Since then I have been friends with her. Since I have lived', 'in Warwick, approximately two years, I have had [Jane’s mother]’s', 'children, [Jane’s brother and Jane], sleep over on occasion. [Jane]', 'slept over three times alone. The children did not sleep over', 'together. The last time I remember [Jane] sleeping over was in', 'January of 2006. My mother Marie went to work. She worked 11', 'p.m. to 7 a.m. on that night. I was alone with [Jane]. I started to', 'have sexual thoughts about [Jane] after she went to sleep. [Jane]', 'was sleeping in my mother’s bedroom. I went into the bedroom', 'wearing shorts and sat on the bed next to [Jane]. I found [Jane]', 'attractive and looked at her while she was sleeping. I was aroused', 'and had a hard-on. I rubbed my penis over my pants while', 'watching [Jane]. I pulled [Jane]’s shorts down just past her butt. I', 'did not pull her underwear down. I put my hand on her thigh', 'inside and rubbed it. I may have touched her vagina over her', 'underwear with my hand. I was lying down next to her at that', 'point and my penis brushed her leg under my pants. I did this for', 'about 20 minutes, and I said, ‘I can’t do this.’ I pulled [Jane]’s', 'pants up and left the room. I thought that she was sleeping. I', 'could have penetrated her, but I did not. I did not touch her vagina', 'with my penis. I did not insert my fingers in her vagina.', '“On other times [Jane] has come on to me. She has asked', 'me to rub her back and hair. I did this. I find [Jane] very', 'attractive, and I wanted to have sex with her, but I could not get', 'myself to completely do it. I found [Jane] different and I did not', '-7- When the statement was complete, Det. Grant read the finalized statement back to defendant, and he signed it.', 'On February 6, 2008, a jury found defendant guilty of the two second-degree counts of child molestation, but it was unable to reach a verdict on the first-degree charge. A mistrial was declared, but the state later voluntarily dismissed the remaining count of first-degree child molestation. On February 13, 2008, defendant retained new counsel and moved for a new trial. A hearing on the motion for a new trial took place on May 16, 2008. Alan B. Feinstein, a clinical psychologist, testified about a condition termed oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), with which Jane had been diagnosed at the age of four.', 'Posttrial counsel explained that the ODD diagnosis was relevant to explain Jane’s “violent altercations with people,” which could explain why she “beat up” defendant. Posttrial counsel also sought to address the fact that Jane had nightmares “prior to any time when she was allegedly assaulted.” Because both the ODD diagnosis and the nightmares were referred to in the Butler Hospital records, counsel argued that the Butler Hospital records should have been provided to defendant.', 'Pretrial counsel then testified; he was questioned about the extent to which he had reviewed the records that had been subpoenaed, including the Butler Hospital records. Pretrial counsel explained that he issued the subpoenas in April 2007 to Butler Hospital, the Kent Center, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), and the Family Court. Although he recalled certain records from DCYF and the Kent Center, he explained that he did not “remember whether or not [he] had possession of the records from Butler Hospital.” He did', 'feel like that towards her brother. I know what I did was wrong', 'and I feel very sorry for what I did. I never meant to hurt [Jane]. I', 'ask[ed] Detective Grant to write this statement out for me because', 'I am illiterate. I agree with this statement.”', '-8- remember, however, that Butler Hospital “sent a letter to [him]” that “said they would be forwarding the records to [the motion justice] for his review.” 9', 'Pretrial counsel also described that he was familiar with the motion justice’s procedure of conducting a review of subpoenaed medical records, whereby documents were delivered to the Superior Court and the attorneys would be permitted to review the records. He explained that he did not recall whether he was contacted by any member of the Superior Court about reviewing the Butler Hospital records, but he also said that he did not recall “being refused access” to the records. He “c[ould]n’t say that [he] did or did not have a chance to review those records,” and he explained that he “may have looked at them, but [he] d[id]n’t remember.” When presented with the Butler Hospital records for his review at the hearing, he noted that he “[did]n’t recall seeing these, but the information contained therein, a lot of it [wa]s in the Kent Center records. Diagnoses were in there that [he] saw quickly, incidents of prior conduct [were] both in DCYF and Kent Center records.”', 'Next, trial counsel was examined. He explained that he received a copy of pretrial counsel’s files after he assumed responsibility for the case. He testified that he did not recall whether there were any records from Butler Hospital, but he did take note of the Rule 17(c) subpoenas. He testified that he “saw there were [Rule] 17(c) motions,” but that he “paid no attention to what w[as] returned or not returned at that point,” and he “did not make any independent follow-up to seek or secure the Butler Hospital records.” He explained that he simply “relied upon the records [pretrial counsel] provided, assuming they were complete.” 9', 'The letter, which was marked as an exhibit and read into the record, provided that “this letter is to inform you that any records and treatment of [Jane], * * * at Butler, have been requested and will be sent directly to the Court within one week for an in-camera review by [the motion justice].”', '-9-', 'Finally, a clerk of the Kent County Superior Court testified that the Butler Hospital records had been located in the motion justice’s chambers, although they later were moved to another justice’s chambers. He also explained that records produced for in camera review generally are sent to the trial justice and are not recorded in the clerk’s office.', 'After the hearing, the parties submitted a stipulation about the travel of the Butler Hospital records, which included that the motion justice ordered the records “to be produced for an in camera review,” “[t]he records were mailed directly to [the motion justice] on May 7, 2007,” “[the motion justice] never looked at any of the records himself” because “[i]t was his practice to provide the records to the attorneys to review and designate what they needed for their case,” but that “[the motion justice] recall[ed] provid[ing] some records * * * to [pretrial counsel] and a representative of the Attorney General’s Office.”', 'Based on the testimony adduced at the hearing and the stipulation, the trial justice ultimately denied the motion for new trial on November 26, 2008, and final judgment was entered on January 2, 2009. This appeal ensued.', 'Before this Court, defendant raises the following issues: (1) the trial justice erred when he denied his motion for new trial; (2) the trial justice erred when he failed to properly instruct the jury on the issue of the voluntariness of defendant’s statement to the police; and (3) the trial justice erred when he limited defendant’s cross-examination of Jane.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[o]n motion of the defendant the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of justice.” When we review a motion for a new trial under Rule 33, “[a] trial justice’s ruling * * * will not', '- 10 - be overturned unless the trial justice was clearly wrong or unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.” State v.

This, he contends, deprived him of his rights to compulsory process and confrontation under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. Before this Court, defendant urges that he was prejudiced at trial because he could have used the records to attack Jane’s credibility. The state responds that defendant failed to meet his burden for a new trial grounded on a claim of newly discovered evidence because the hospital records were easily discoverable prior to the trial, and, in any event, the documents would not have changed the verdict at trial.', 'We recognize that a request for confidential health-care information about another person often can create tension between a criminal defendant’s right to effectively cross-examine witnesses and the public’s interest in securing the confidentiality of certain types of information. State v. Kholi, 672 A.2d 429, 436-37 (R.I. 1996). However, a defendant’s constitutional right to evidence does not include an unsupervised romp through another person’s confidential health- care records or the right to make a materiality determination. Id. at 437. An in camera review of sensitive or personal information strikes the requisite balance between those two interests and satisfies due process requirements. Id.', '- 12 -', 'When he ruled on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice made a finding that defendant had served a Rule 17(c) subpoena on Butler Hospital, in which he sought the production of medical records relating to any treatment that Jane may have received. Butler Hospital responded with a motion to quash, which was denied by the motion justice. Thereafter, Butler Hospital notified pretrial counsel by letter, dated May 4, 2007, that it would provide the records to the motion justice. Even though Butler Hospital produced the documents to the court, there is no evidence that either pretrial counsel or trial counsel sought to review them. Pretrial counsel testified at the hearing on the motion for new trial that he did not remember whether he reviewed the records; he did, however, recall receiving the letter from Butler Hospital informing him that the records would arrive at the court within a week. Further, trial counsel testified that he saw the Rule 17(c) subpoena when he was reviewing the case file, but he acknowledged that he did not follow up to determine whether the court had the Butler Hospital records.', 'The trial justice also found that pretrial counsel was well aware of the regular procedure that the motion justice followed when he received records for in camera review, which was to put them aside for the attorneys’ later perusal. When he weighed the merits of the motion for new trial, the trial justice took into consideration that pretrial counsel had, in fact, reviewed a number of other subpoenaed records that had been provided to the court. Indeed, the trial justice noted that the records that had been received in response to other subpoenas served upon DCYF and the Kent Center were contained in envelopes that had been examined by pretrial counsel, as evidenced by his signature and the date of June 14, 2007, as well as a notation on the envelopes containing the documents that he “examined” the records but they were “not needed.” The trial justice also noted that these records reviewed by pretrial counsel reflected Jane’s ODD diagnosis and nightmares, before, during, and after Jane’s hospitalization at Butler Hospital.', '- 13 -', 'Accordingly, we hold that defendant was not deprived of his rights to compulsory process or confrontation because both pretrial counsel and trial counsel were afforded access to the Butler Hospital records. There is no evidence that either the motion justice or the trial justice hindered defendant from getting access to or reviewing those records in any way. 10', 'The defendant relies on this Court’s holding in State v. Kelly, 554 A.2d 632 (R.I. 1989), as support for his argument that he was deprived of his right to compulsory process and his right to confrontation. In that case, we held that a flat refusal by a trial justice to order the production of a witness’s DCYF records on the grounds of confidentiality denied the defendant his right to effective cross-examination. Id. at 636. Here, however, unlike in Kelly, defendant was never deprived of an opportunity to review the Butler Hospital records. The motion justice ordered the records to be produced for an in camera review, and, after its motion to quash was denied, Butler Hospital provided the attorneys with notice that the records were being produced in accordance with the court’s order. We have no hesitation in concluding that failure to take advantage of this opportunity should not, and does not, create a basis for a new trial. 11', 'However, even if there had been an error based on the failure of the motion justice to conduct in camera review, defendant would not be entitled to a new trial, because there was no material prejudice to defendant. In Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 58 (1987), the United States Supreme Court held that a new trial is warranted only if a subsequent in camera review of the records discloses information “that probably would have changed the outcome of [a] trial.” 10', 'In fact, it cannot be gainsaid that the motion justice’s practice of providing attorneys with the opportunity to review the records and determine what they needed afforded defendant greater protection of his rights than if an in camera review had been conducted by the judge. See Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 59 (1987). 11', 'Similarly, defendant cites Love v. Johnson, 57 F.3d 1305 (4th Cir. 1995) and Ritchie, but these cases also are distinguishable, because, in those cases, the defendants were affirmatively denied access to certain records without the court’s first reviewing those records.', '- 14 -', 'In this case, the trial justice explained that he “conducted a page-by-page review of the subject hospital records and * * * found that none of them need[ed] [to] have been disclosed to trial counsel,” and “[a]fter performing the balancing test required by [G.L. 1956] §§ 5-37.3- 6.1(d) and (e), * * * any perceived need for the information contained therein does not ‘clearly outweigh the privacy interest of the individual’ involved * * *.” The trial justice considered the particular information in the Butler Hospital records about Jane’s nightmares and ODD diagnoses, and he found that they were “well documented throughout the records reviewed and copied by [pretrial counsel].” The Kent Center records, dated January 4, 2005—which were more proximate in time to the incidents alleged in the indictment than were the Butler Hospital records—refer to Jane’s “frequent bad dreams,” and the other records that pretrial counsel did review are replete with more than seventy references to Jane’s ODD diagnosis. As a result, the motion justice ultimately concluded that on this evidence he would have found defendant guilty, as did the jury. Accordingly, after reviewing the record before us, we conclude that the motion justice did not err when he rejected defendant’s motion for new trial.', '2', 'Police Statement', 'The defendant next contends that the trial justice erred in rejecting posttrial counsel’s argument that the state was required to produce certain police statements that either mentioned or were provided by Jane. The defendant argues that withholding Jane’s police statement from him violated the state’s obligations under Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). 12 The state responds that it had no obligation to produce those statements, that defendant did not overcome the evidentiary burden for a new trial 12', 'Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) is the seminal case that stands for the proposition that the prosecuting authority must timely disclose all “exculpatory” information of which it is aware.', '- 15 - because the police statements easily were discoverable prior to the trial, and that, in any event, the statements were not material to the issues tried before the jury.', 'We review a trial justice’s decision about whether a violation of Rule 16 or a Brady violation has occurred with great deference to the trial justice, and we will not disturb his or her ruling unless he or she has committed clear error. State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008) (citing State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 755 (R.I. 2005)). When a criminal defendant requests discovery material concerning witnesses whom the state may call to testify at trial, Rule 16(a)(8) obligates the state to provide “written or recorded verbatim statements, signed or unsigned, of such persons” it expects to call as witnesses; and failure to comply with the obligation may subject the state to a variety of sanctions, based on Rule 16(i). See State v. Chalk, 816 A.2d 413, 418 (R.I. 2002).', 'Beyond the mandates of Rule 16, the due process requirements of the United States Constitution, as interpreted in Brady and its progeny, and the Rhode Island Constitution require the state to turn over information that “(1) constitute[s] either exculpatory or impeachment evidence and (2) [is] material to the outcome of the case or sentencing.” State v. Wyche, 518 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 1986). In order to demonstrate that a Brady violation has occurred, a defendant has the burden of showing that “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” McManus, 941 A.2d at 230 (quoting Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 880 (R.I. 2001)). However, the prosecution is not responsible for delivering information that is not within its custody or control. Wyche, 518 A.2d at 909.', 'At issue are thirteen police reports of the Warwick Police Department that either refer to or name Jane. But only two of the documents contain “written or recorded verbatim statements”', '- 16 - by Jane. See Rule 16(a)(8). Both are witness statements that Jane wrote about criminal incidents to which she was an eyewitness; neither relate to the allegations of the instant case in any way. The other documents contain non-verbatim statements—which the state is not required to produce under Rule 16(a)(8)—allegedly made by Jane to the police. These also pertain to matters not relevant to this case; two reports relate to crimes committed by third parties, one to a curfew/loitering/vagrancy of another juvenile who Jane was allegedly with, one to Jane’s unauthorized operation of a motor vehicle, five about Jane being missing or a runaway, one about Jane being “extremely disrespectful, staying out late, * * * involved with drug use, and * * * sexually active with older boys,” and one to a coyote attack that Jane observed. None of the reports, however, relates to the incidents that were the subject of the trial. Other than generally suggesting that these police reports somehow might indicate that Jane was a troubled child, defendant has failed to specifically indicate any way in which the reports might be considered to be material or that the outcome of the trial might have been different had defendant been provided access to them before the trial. 13', 'Therefore, we agree with the trial justice’s determination that the police reports were not discoverable under Rule 16. 13', 'We note that defendant does argue that at least one police report, which was unrelated to the underlying sexual assault, demonstrates Jane’s propensity to tell inconsistent and untruthful stories to the police and might warrant an inference against her credibility. Although the police report indicates that Jane “changed her story several times and there were inconsistencies with her observations at the scene,” there is no nexus between Jane’s sexual assault and the crime Jane described in the police report on December 16, 2006, which occurred almost six months after the last sexual assault was alleged to have occurred. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his broad discretion in finding that it was “incomprehensible” as to how the “perceived inconsistencies” in the police statement could be properly used to impeach her and that, therefore, the police report was “clearly not relevant.” See Rules 401 and 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Indeed, this Court has consistently held that “[a] witness may not be impeached on collateral matters by the introduction of extrinsic evidence.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1243 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Tutt, 622 A.2d 459, 462 (R.I. 1993); see Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“Specific instances of the conduct of a witness,', '- 17 -', 'With regard to the alleged Brady violation, there also was no evidence that the state possessed the reports prior to trial, or even that the state was aware of their existence. The trial justice performed a document-by-document review of all the police records, described each document in detail, and found that the statements were not exculpatory. He observed that defendant produced no evidence, nor was there any support in the record, that would indicate that the state deliberately failed to disclose the police reports. Further, the motion justice observed that a number of the incidents that were reported in the police statements also were referred to in the Kent Center and DCYF records, which pretrial counsel reviewed and copied. Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not err when he held that none of the information constituted exculpatory evidence that the state had an obligation to produce under Brady.', 'B', 'Jury Instructions', 'The defendant further contends that the motion justice failed to correctly instruct the jury on the “Humane Practice Rule” with respect to the voluntariness of his police statement. 14 “It is axiomatic that ‘this [C]ourt will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal that was not properly presented before the trial court.’” State v. Castellucci, 771 A.2d 902, 903 (R.I. 2001) (mem.) (quoting State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1258 (R.I. 1998)). “A failure to object to a jury instruction precludes review of the instruction on appeal.” State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1007 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 795 (R.I. 2004)). for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility * * * may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.”). 14', 'The Humane Practice Rule provides an important procedural safeguard with respect to the constitutional rights of criminal defendants. See State v. Dennis, 893 A.2d 250, 261-62 (R.I. 2006). Our “Humane Practice Rule requires that judge and jury make separate and independent determinations of voluntariness * * *.” Id. at 262. In other words, the Humane Practice Rule provides that any statement of a criminal defendant “may not serve as a basis for conviction unless both judge and jury determine that it was voluntarily made.” Id.', '- 18 -', 'The record in the present case is devoid of any evidence whatsoever that defendant raised an objection to the jury instructions. 15 Indeed, before he instructed the jury, the trial justice met with the attorneys and asked whether “either attorney ha[d] any current objections to the proposed charge or any additions that they want [him] to consider,” or whether there were “any issues we need to discuss prior to bringing in the jury for purposes of final argument and charge.” Defense counsel replied, “No, Your Honor.” After he instructed the jury, the trial justice again asked the attorneys whether there were “any objections or requested additions to the charge that I’ve given to the jury,” to which trial counsel responded, “neither an objection nor exception.” Because defendant did not object to the finalized jury charge, this argument has been waived on appeal, and we shall not consider it. See Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d at 1007. 15', 'A portion of the trial justice’s final charge to the jury relating to the voluntariness issue is as follows:', '“As you are aware, the defendant made statements to the', 'police while he was in their custody. You may not consider those', 'statements as substantive evidence, however, unless you are', 'satisfied in the first instance that the State has demonstrated by', 'clear and convincing evidence; that is to say, by a high probability,', 'that before making those statements, the defendant had been', 'advised of certain constitutional rights, the so-called Miranda', 'rights; namely, that the defendant had a right to remain silent; that', 'anything he said could and would be used against him in court; that', 'he had the right to have an attorney present before and during any', 'questioning by the police and that if he desired an attorney at that', 'time and could not afford one, an attorney would be appointed for', 'him.', '“The State must also demonstrate from a totality of the', 'circumstances that it is highly probable the defendant understood', 'those rights and that thereafter he voluntarily wa[i]ved those rights', 'in an intelligent and informed manner without threats or coercion', 'or promises by the police.”', '- 19 -', 'C', 'Cross-Examination', 'Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in limiting defendant’s cross- examination of Jane about her refusal to undergo a physical examination in connection with her allegations of child molestation. Specifically, defendant argues that Jane’s assertion that she did not want to be touched was manifestly untrue, based upon information available to defendant that her allegations first arose during a conversation with her mother about her sexual history. The state contends that defendant failed to adhere to the prerequisites of Rule 412 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, as well as the requirements of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-13, before he cross- examined Jane about her purported prior sexual activity with third parties. Therefore, the state stresses, the trial justice properly decided to preclude trial counsel from going any farther concerning this line of inquiry.', '“Inherent in a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him or her—found in both article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution—‘is the fundamental right of the criminal defendant to cross-examine his or her accusers.’” State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 906 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397, 411 (R.I. 2007)). This right to cross-examine, however “is not unbounded.” Id. (quoting Drew, 919 A.2d at 411). “[T]rial justices are accorded wide discretion to curtail cross-examination after there has been ‘sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.’” Rivera, 987 A.2d at 906 (quoting Drew, 919 A.2d at 411). This Court reviews “[a] trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination * * * for clear abuse of discretion; the decision will be overruled ‘only if such abuse constitutes prejudicial error.’” Id. (quoting Drew, 919 A.2d at 411).', '- 20 -', 'Significantly, Rule 412, which is almost identical to § 11-37-13, provides, in pertinent part:', '“If a defendant who is charged with the crime of sexual assault', 'intends to introduce proof that the complaining witness has', 'engaged in sexual activities with other persons, he or she shall give', 'notice of his or her intention to the court and the attorney for the', 'state. The notice shall be given prior to the introduction of any', 'evidence of such fact * * *.” (Emphasis added.) The statute and the evidentiary rule both require a defendant to provide notice, outside the presence of the jury, of his intent to inquire about the complainant’s sexual activity with others. After notice is given, the trial justice “shall order the defendant to make a specific offer of the proof that he or she intends to introduce in support of this issue.” Rule 412; § 11-37-13.', 'In this case, the defendant failed to provide any notice either to the court or to the state before he sought to cross-examine Jane about her alleged previous sexual conduct.', 'By prohibiting this line of inquiry, the trial justice acted completely in accord with his responsibilities in light of the statutory provision and the rule of evidence. Moreover, the record reveals that the defendant was permitted to engage in extensive cross-examination: counsel vigorously explored Jane’s relationship with the defendant, her visits to his home, the three incidents of sexual molestation, and her refusal to allow an examination by medical staff after the assaults. 16 Further, the trial justice found that Jane’s “testimony regarding her refusal to consent to a gynecological examination may very well [have] lead to the jury’s failure to agree on a verdict as to the count alleging sexual penetration, [but] the results of the examination, if any, would not have been probative as to the two counts of sexual contact.” He also found that Jane’s “consensual sex with other children, if any, would have been irrelevant and therefore 16', 'Specifically, when asked why she refused to undergo a physical examination by a doctor after the incidents, Jane explained that it was “’[c]ause [she] d[id]n’t want no one [sic] touching [her].”', '- 21 - inadmissible,” and her unwillingness to have an “unfamiliar doctor examine her body’s most private parts was understandably more than [she] could bear.” Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he limited the defendant’s cross-examination of Jane about her refusal to undergo a physical examination.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction in this case.

95,State : v. : Thomas G. Lamoureux. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Thomas G. Lamoureux (Lamoureux or defendant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction declaring him to be in violation of his probation and executing seven years of his previously imposed suspended sentence. On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of this judgment. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 6, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Lamoureux pled guilty to manslaughter on September 26, 1994. He received a sentence of thirty years in prison, with ten years to serve and twenty years suspended, along with twenty', '-1- years probation. Since then, he has twice been adjudged a probation violator. 1 Lamoureux’s third and most recent probation violation is the subject of this appeal. The events underlying the adjudication now before us for review took place on October 7 and 8, 2011. Those events were described in detail at a hearing held before a justice of the Superior Court on December 7, 2011. We now summarize that proceeding, omitting testimony not relevant to our disposition of this appeal.', 'Two siblings testified for the prosecution: Joanne Michaud and David Michaud. 2 Joanne testified that as of October 2011, she had known Lamoureux for a long time and had been dating him for four years. On October 7, 2011, Lamoureux arrived uninvited at her apartment in Woonsocket at around 4 p.m. She recalled that after he arrived, Lamoureux asked her for some money. When she declined that request, he reached over her and used a pair of scissors to cut the strap of her purse, which she had been wearing on her shoulder. Joanne explained that when Lamoureux leaned toward her to cut the strap of her purse, she thought he was about to embrace her. He then slapped her across the face, went through her purse, and took the money inside— about $480. She testified that she had a red mark on her face after this incident. When she told him that she was going to call the police, he “took off.” Soon after, Joanne gave a statement to police in which she recounted the details of this encounter.', 'Despite this incident, the following day, on October 8, 2011, Joanne accompanied Lamoureux and his mother to the annual Autumnfest in Woonsocket. Apparently, Joanne did not discuss the previous day’s events with Lamoureux; she stated that “[h]e never remembers.” 1', 'In March 2004, Lamoureux was ordered to serve 120 days in prison, with 236 months remaining suspended. In January 2011, he was ordered to serve six months in prison, with 230 months remaining suspended. The latter violation stemmed from an incident involving Joanne Michaud, one of the complaining witnesses in this case. 2', 'We refer to Joanne and David by their first names for the sake of clarity and intend no disrespect.', '-2- She explained that she normally used a wheelchair to get around because of various medical issues and did not want to go to the Autumnfest alone for this reason. Once at the Autumnfest, Joanne gave Lamoureux some money; he then became separated from her and his mother. At some point, she left the Autumnfest to visit her brother, David, for a barbecue at his house. When she arrived, Lamoureux was there.', 'Joanne testified that her brother and the other guests at the barbecue wanted Lamoureux to leave because he was intoxicated. 3 When she and David asked him to leave, he grabbed a case of beer from her and tore it open. Lamoureux “punched [her] in the stomach and grabbed [her] purse and then * * * picked [her] up by the throat and threw [her] on the ground.” He then picked up a steak off the grill and flung it at David. Next, Lamoureux flipped over the grill and “charged after” David. Lamoureux, she said, tore David’s shirt off and, at some point after David attempted to defend himself, pulled a knife on him. Joanne averred that she recognized the knife as hers; it had been in the purse Lamoureux had stolen from her the previous day. Lamoureux then cut David’s arm and stabbed him in the stomach twice. At some point, David “grabbed [Joanne’s] wheelchair to push [Lamoureux] away from him and pin him down * * *.” After police were called, Lamoureux “took off.” Joanne claimed that although she told police that Lamoureux had thrown the knife into a neighbor’s yard, the police “wouldn’t go in the next yard to get the knife.”', 'On cross-examination, Joanne admitted that when police came to take her statement after the incident on October 7, 2011, she had not explained exactly how Lamoureux had stolen money from her. She said that she did not tell the police that he had cut her purse strap with 3', 'Although there was some inconsistency as to whether anyone besides Joanne, David, David’s girlfriend, and Lamoureux were at the barbecue, this is irrelevant to our disposition of this appeal.', '-3- scissors because “[t]hey didn’t ask me.” In addition, she testified that, while she had told police that Lamoureux had broken a chair in her apartment that day, she did not actually see him do so. Concerning the altercation at the barbecue on October 8, 2011, Joanne explained that the police refused to take a statement from her that day. She also claimed that the police told her to leave her wheelchair “for evidence because it was covered in blood * * *.” Lastly, she explained that although she had called the police several times before October 2011 to report break-ins at her apartment and had identified Lamoureux as the perpetrator in one of these reports, no charges were filed against him as a result of these reports.', 'David was the next witness to testify at the hearing. His testimony largely corroborated that of his sister’s. He explained that when Lamoureux arrived uninvited at his house on October 8, 2011, the two men went to the backyard and had a beer. Lamoureux asked David and his girlfriend for more beer, but neither of them obliged.', 'David then described the ensuing altercation, recounting that incident more or less as Joanne had described it.', 'A photograph of a stab wound David sustained during the altercation was introduced into evidence over Lamoureux’s objection.', 'On cross-examination, David admitted that in his statement to police, he told them that he had not seen Lamoureux with a knife. In response to a question from the hearing justice, David confirmed that he had not seen Lamoureux pull a knife on him during the fight.', 'Finally, defense counsel called Officer Jason Berthelett of the Woonsocket Police Department. Officer Berthelett testified that he was on duty on October 8, 2011, the day of the altercation at the barbecue. Apparently, after leaving David’s house, Lamoureux encountered other police officers nearby.', 'The officers noticed that Lamoureux had some injuries and requested that an ambulance be dispatched to their location.', 'Officer Berthelett first saw', '-4- Lamoureux in the back of that ambulance, where he was being attended to by paramedics. He explained that he came into contact with Lamoureux because “he * * * matched a description of a person who had fled the scene of a potential other crime * * *.” He noticed that Lamoureux had “a couple of cuts” on his body. After speaking with Lamoureux, Officer Berthelett went to David’s house. There, he observed a laceration on David’s arm. He stated that a knife was not recovered from the scene of the altercation. Officer Berthelett testified that, although he did not personally search for the knife, he requested other officers to do so. It was unclear, however, whether other officers actually searched the neighboring yard for the knife.', 'After hearing arguments from counsel, the hearing justice articulated the standard of proof applicable to the proceeding: “[T]he [c]ourt must be reasonably satisfied that the actions of the defendant are sufficient * * * to find that he has not kept his promise to keep the peace and be of good behavior * * *.” He characterized the events recounted by the Michaud siblings as a “bizarre story of interpersonal relations.” The hearing justice described Joanne’s conduct— specifically, accompanying Lamoureux to the Autumnfest the day after she claimed he assaulted her—as “[b]izarre but not unbelievable.” After reviewing the evidence presented at the hearing, he concluded that Lamoureux “[had] put himself into unseemly and probably criminal activities within [twenty-four] hours of each other.” He found that Lamoureux had violated his probation “by the actions occasioned to [Joanne] on October 7th and October 8th and in the melee that I believe he precipitated in [David’s backyard].”', 'The hearing justice sentenced Lamoureux to serve seven years of his previously suspended sentence, with the balance of that sentence remaining suspended. Judgment against', '-5- Lamoureux entered on January 20, 2012, followed by a corrected judgment making his sentence retroactive to October 8, 2011, the date of his arrest. 4 Lamoureux timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The only issue on appeal is whether the evidence presented at the probation-violation hearing was sufficient to support the hearing justice’s finding that Lamoureux had violated the terms of his probation under Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Lamoureux characterizes that evidence as “dubious, conflicting, and minimal.” He contends that Joanne’s testimony about the incident at her apartment on October 7, 2011, conflicted with the account of that incident she gave to police that day. He argues that Joanne’s version of that day’s events is doubtful, given her testimony that she accompanied him to the Autumnfest on the next day. As to the incident on October 8, 2011, Lamoureux points out that he was not charged as a result of his alleged assault on Joanne.', 'Lamoureux notes that the hearing justice characterized his behavior as “untoward” and “unseemly,” which, according to Lamoureux, suggests that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he violated the terms and conditions of his probation.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“The sole issue for a hearing justice to consider at a probation-violation hearing is whether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v. Delarosa, 39 A.3d 1043, 1049 (R.I. 2012) 4', 'Although Lamoureux’s notice of appeal to this Court was premature, we treat such a filing as timely. See State v. Delarosa, 39 A.3d 1043, 1049 n.12 (R.I. 2012) (citing State v. Pona, 13 A.3d 642, 646 n.3 (R.I. 2011)).', '-6- (quoting State v. English, 21 A.3d 403, 406 (R.I. 2011)). The state must produce “‘reasonably satisfactory’ evidence [to support] a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.” Id. (quoting State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 310 (R.I. 2008)). “In determining whether or not a defendant has committed a probation violation, the hearing justice is charged with weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. at 1049-50 (quoting State v. Pona, 13 A.3d 642, 647 (R.I. 2011)). We confine our review of a finding of a violation of probation “to considering whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.” Id. at 1050 (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407). Because the merits of any new charges are not the focus of a probation-violation hearing, see State v. Brown, 915 A.2d 1279, 1282 (R.I. 2007), they are not the focus of our review on appeal. 5', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'After carefully reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that Lamoureux had violated the terms and conditions of his probation. With respect to the events of October 7, 2011, Joanne’s testimony regarding that incident was consistent in all material aspects with the statement she gave to police that day. That day, and at the hearing, she stated that the incident had occurred around 4 p.m., that Lamoureux had taken $480 from her, and that he slapped her across the face after taking her money. Although she did not mention that Lamoureux had broken one of her chairs when describing this incident on direct examination, as she had told police on the day of the incident, 5', 'In connection with the events described above, Lamoureux was charged with felony assault with a dangerous weapon and domestic misdemeanor assault. After Lamoureux was adjudged to be a probation violator, those charges were dismissed under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-7- she did confirm this detail on cross-examination. In our view, the hearing justice did not err in finding that, although Joanne’s account of this incident was “bizarre,” it was “not unbelievable.”', 'Likewise, we must reject Lamoureux’s argument that the hearing justice erred in finding that he had violated his probation by engaging in a “melee” in David’s backyard on October 8, 2011. The hearing justice correctly stated that he did not have to determine whether Lamoureux had assaulted David with a dangerous weapon to find that Lamoureux had violated his probation. Correctly focusing on Lamoureux’s behavior rather than on the sufficiency of the evidence against him on the new charges, the hearing justice found that Lamoureux “[had] put himself into unseemly and probably criminal activities within [twenty-four] hours of each other.”', 'The hearing justice observed the witnesses in this matter, and our precedent requires us to afford deference to his factual findings. We conclude, as did the hearing justice, that the evidence adduced at the hearing was sufficient to support a finding that Lamoureux had violated the terms of his probation.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '-8-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

On January 15, 1991, he was found guilty by a jury on both charges, and he was sentenced to twelve years, with six years to serve and six years suspended, with probation. Camacho appealed his conviction to this Court, and on December 18, 1992, in an unpublished order we vacated the convictions, holding that the state had attempted to influence or intimidate witnesses. The case was remanded to the Newport County Superior Court for a new trial. However, instead of proceeding with a new trial, applicant entered an Alford plea 1 on June 4, 1993, to both of the indictment’s counts of second-degree child molestation. The trial justice2 sentenced applicant to the same sentence he received at the trial: twelve years, with six years to serve and six years suspended, with probation. 3', 'On July 23, 2010, more than seventeen years after entering the Alford plea, Camacho filed an application for postconviction relief, seeking to vacate his plea and his sentence based on what he alleged was a plea colloquy that failed to satisfy constitutional mandates and on Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 4 Specifically, he argued that he was not fully 1', 'Under the holding in North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 38 (1970), a court may accept a defendant’s plea of guilty or nolo contendere if the court is satisfied that there is enough factual evidence to support a verdict. 2', 'For clarity, we will refer to the judge who presided over applicant’s trial as the “trial justice,” and the judge who heard applicant’s motion for postconviction relief as the “postconviction- relief justice.” 3', 'The applicant was credited for the time already served, satisfying the six-year sentence to serve. 4', 'Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that', '“[a] defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of', 'the court, nolo contendere.

As a result of those omissions, he alleged that the trial justice could not have been satisfied that his plea was made voluntarily and intelligently, and the trial justice never received an assurance that Camacho actually understood the charges against him. The state responded that there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that applicant understood both the nature of the charges and the consequence of the plea.', 'The applicant waived an evidentiary hearing on his postconviction-relief application, and on May 20, 2011, oral arguments were heard in the Superior Court. Relying on the parties’ memoranda, arguments, and the record, the postconviction-relief justice issued a decision, dated August 3, 2011. When considering applicant’s argument that there was no mention of two of the elements of second-degree child molestation, the postconviction-relief justice found that the mere absence of these two elements did not in and of itself undermine the validity of the plea. He articulated that the proper standard to review a plea’s validity was the totality of the circumstances; and, after a review of the record, he concluded that there was a sufficient factual and legal basis to find that applicant’s plea was voluntary and intelligent and that he understood the nature of the charges against him.', 'On August 22, 2010, applicant timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court. Before this Court, applicant argues that the postconviction-relief justice violated his state and federal', 'the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.

State, 45 A.3d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 2012) (quoting DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011)). We note that an applicant for postconviction relief must bear “the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [postconviction] relief is warranted” in his or her case. Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 601 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 901 n.7 (R.I. 2008)). “When ‘reviewing the denial of postconviction relief, this Court affords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact and will not disturb his or her ruling absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Higham, 45 A.3d at 1183 (quoting Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 907-08 (R.I. 2011)). This Court, however, will review de novo any determination pertaining to an issue concerning an applicant’s constitutional rights. Hassett v. State, 899 A.2d 430, 433 (R.I. 2006).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, applicant argues that the postconviction-relief justice erred when he denied his application because the plea colloquy in his underlying case was not a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights and, therefore, failed to comply with Rule 11. He challenges', '-4- the fact that there was no reference to or mention of what he contends are the elements of the crime for second-degree child molestation, including a requirement of touching a child’s intimate part(s) “for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal,” and a requirement that the victim be fourteen years old or under. 5', 'There can be no question that a decision to plead nolo contendere to a criminal charge is not one to be taken lightly. See State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1266 (R.I. 1980). It is significant that in Rhode Island, a plea of nolo contendere is treated as a guilty plea. Id. “A defendant entering such a plea ‘waives several federal constitutional rights and consents to [the] judgment of the court.’” Id. (quoting Johnson v. Mullen, 120 R.I. 701, 706, 390 A.2d 909, 912 (1978)). Rule 11 sets forth the manner in which a trial justice must conduct a plea proceeding to ensure that there is compliance with constitutional requirements. Rule 11 requires that the Superior Court “shall not accept * * * a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.”', 'On the other hand, Rule 11 is not intended to “serve as a trap for those justices who fail to enumerate each fact relied on to accept such a plea.” State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 936 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Feng, 421 A.2d at 1269). “[A]t the conclusion of a plea hearing, the trial justice should be able to say with assurance that the accused is fully aware of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.” State v. Williams, 122 R.I. 32, 40, 404 A.2d 814, 819 (1979). As we have explained, 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.3 states that: “[a] person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” “Sexual contact” is defined as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7).', '-5-', '“[t]hat objective may be attained by:', '‘(1) an explanation of the essential elements by the judge at the', 'guilty plea hearing;', '(2) a representation that counsel had explained to the defendant', 'the elements he admits by his plea [footnote omitted];', '(3) defendant’s statements admitting to facts constituting the', 'unexplained element or stipulations to such facts.’” Id. at', '41, 404 A.2d at 819 (quoting Commonwealth v. McGuirk,', '380 N.E.2d 662, 666 (Mass. 1978)). Thus, the standard is not whether the trial court sufficiently made a detailed explanation of the charges, element by element, and fact by fact, but, more importantly, whether the defendant understood them. Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637, 644-45 (1976). A finding may be based on the “record viewed in its totality.” Frazar, 822 A.2d at 935 (quoting Feng, 421 A.2d at 1269). The applicant “bear[s] the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that [he or she] did not intelligently and understandingly waive [his or her] rights.” State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 498 (R.I. 1994).', 'Here, after having reviewed the record carefully, it is our opinion that the postconviction- relief justice was complete and thorough in his finding that applicant’s nolo contendere plea was voluntary and that it was made with clear understanding of the charges against him. To support his findings, the postconviction-relief justice carefully analyzed the transcript of the Alford plea hearing. He first noted that the plea colloquy began with the trial justice confirming that applicant was before him for an indictment involving two counts of alleged second-degree child molestation. The trial justice also noted that there had been lengthy negotiations undertaken in an effort to dispose of the case.', 'The postconviction-relief justice then examined the plea transcript and stated that the trial justice had asked applicant whether he had read, understood, and signed the plea form. The applicant responded that he had. Further, the postconviction-relief justice observed that the trial', '-6- justice then asked applicant whether he understood the rights that he was waiving—not once, but twice—and both times applicant replied that he did understand. The transcript also revealed that applicant verified that his defense counsel explained the plea form to him, including his constitutional rights; he also acknowledged that counsel had explained that a plea would waive those rights. Finally, defense counsel herself assured the trial justice that she had explained the plea form and that, in her opinion, applicant understood the rights he was waiving. See Tavares v. State, 826 A.2d 941, 943 (R.I. 2003) (acknowledging proper colloquy when trial justice clearly explained defendant’s rights and inquired about defendant’s understanding of the plea form).', 'After this, the postconviction-relief justice quoted the portion of the transcript in which the trial justice asked the prosecutor to provide the factual basis for the charges. See Feng, 421 A.2d at 1269 (holding that it is acceptable for the trial justice to rely on the prosecutor’s recitation of the state’s evidence to establish the factual basis for the record). The recitation of the facts on each charge was as follows:', '“As to N1-89-0403A, if this matter had gone to trial, the State', 'would prove that on days and dates between January 1, 1986, and', 'December 31st, 1986, at Middletown, that Miguel Camacho did', 'engage in sexual contact with Jane Doe,[6] a person under the age', 'of 16.[7]', '“As to Count 2, that Miguel Camacho, on days and dates between', 'January 1, 1986, and December 31st, 1986, at Middletown, did', 'engage in sexual contact with Mary Doe, a person under the age of', '14 years of age.” 6', 'The name of this victim, who is a minor, and all other names used in this opinion are pseudonyms, except for applicant’s name. 7', 'Although the prosecutor did misstate the age of the victim with respect to this count of the indictment, it is not lost on us that one victim was five or six years old at the time of the incident and the other victim was six or seven years old. Any error on the part of the trial justice with respect to ensuring that applicant understood that the victim was required to be under the age of fourteen, and not sixteen, cannot be anything but harmless in light of this fact.', '-7- The postconviction-relief justice also considered that, following the recitation of the facts, the trial justice had addressed applicant directly as to his understanding of the charges against him:', '“All right. Mr. Camacho, I understand that under the Alford Plea', 'Doctrine, you are acknowledging that there is evidence in this case', 'that if it reached the jury in this case, they could find you guilty', 'beyond a reasonable doubt. Though you are not admitting that you', 'did this, you are acknowledging that there would be sufficient', 'evidence for that jury to find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Do you understand that? [Defendant:] Yes, Your Honor.” The postconviction-relief justice also found that applicant’s “apology” to the victims and their family was telling with respect to his understanding of the charges against him. 8', 'The postconviction-relief justice then summarized his findings from the record to support his conclusion, which included: (1) the protracted plea-agreement negotiations, (2) applicant’s participation in a long jury trial, which included testimony from both victims that detailed the facts to prove each element of the charges as well as jury instructions on each element of both charges, (3) applicant’s pursuit of an appeal to have the convictions vacated, (4) applicant’s affirmation of his understanding of the plea during the plea colloquy, (5) the defense attorney’s assurance that she had explained the plea form containing the charges to applicant before he pled, (6) applicant’s affirmation—twice—of his understanding of the plea form, including when he acknowledged his signature and again when he affirmed that he had read the plea form before signing it, and (7) applicant’s contrition for what he did, which he expressed in open court. Based on these findings, the postconviction-relief justice concluded that applicant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not understand the plea that he had made over seventeen years earlier. The postconviction-relief justice found that based on the totality of the 8', 'Specifically, applicant said, “I regret any inconvenience or trouble which my association with the [Doe] family has caused them, and I am sorry for any inconvenience or trouble which may have occurred.”', '-8- circumstances, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s conclusion that applicant made the plea voluntarily and that it was “beyond belief and not supported by the record” that applicant was unaware of the nature of the charges to which he pled.', 'After reviewing the postconviction-relief justice’s thorough and thoughtful decision, as well as the entire record before us, we agree with the postconviction-relief justice’s conclusion that the applicant’s plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing, and that the applicant was well aware of the nature of the charges against him at the time he pleaded to them. See Azevedo v. State, 945 A.2d 335, 338 (R.I. 2008) (where this Court considered “the testimony of trial counsel, the transcript of the plea proceeding, and [the] applicant’s own responses to questioning” to determine if a plea was a knowing and intelligent waiver). This Court repeatedly has held that it “shall not vacate a plea unless the record viewed in its totality discloses no facts that could have satisfied the trial justice that a factual basis existed for a defendant’s plea.” Frazar, 822 A.2d at 935-36 (quoting Feng, 421 A.2d at 1269). In our opinion, Camacho’s arguments must fail because he has not satisfied his burden of proving that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. See Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 84 n.1 (R.I. 2007) (holding that “[a]n applicant for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [such] relief is warranted”).', 'We agree with the postconviction-relief justice that the trial justice conducted an appropriate plea colloquy in accordance with Rule 11, and there is utterly no basis for us to vacate the applicant’s plea. 9 9', 'Although we have considered and decided this case on its merits, we cannot help but observe that it was equally appropriate for disposition under the doctrine of laches.

In June 2006, Pearl E. Archambault tragically died while in the care of Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC (Haven Health) after a nurse mistakenly administered a lethal overdose of morphine. The administratrix of her estate, Tracie Peloquin (plaintiff), filed a medical malpractice action and now appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of her partial summary-judgment motion and grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant Columbia Casualty Company (Columbia), 1 the professional liability insurer of the now-defunct nursing facility. 2', 'The plaintiff avers that the Superior Court erred in interpreting Rhode Island law, argues that this Court should construe the insurance contract between Columbia and its insured in her favor, and urges this Court to reverse the Superior 1', 'Typically, the denial of a plaintiff’s summary-judgment motion is reviewable only through a petition for certiorari, and is not appealable as a matter of right. “However, this Court ‘regularly consider[s] appeals from the denial of a motion for summary judgment when coupled with an appeal or cross-appeal of the granting of a motion for summary judgment.’” Avilla v. Newport Grand Jai Alai LLC, 935 A.2d 91, 94 n.4 (R.I. 2007) (quoting O’Gara v.

Thus, we will consider both plaintiff’s appeal of the grant of summary judgment for Columbia as well as the denial of plaintiff’s motion. 2', 'Because there have been multiple defendants involved in this case, we will refer to Columbia by name in this opinion to maintain clarity. Of the various defendants, only Columbia is party to this appeal.', '-1- Court’s decision and order that summary judgment be entered in her favor.

On June 24 of that year, Denise Hardesty, 4 a registered nurse employed by Haven Health, misinterpreted a physician’s order prescribing five milligrams of a morphine solution, and instead administered five milliliters of that substance to Archambault. As a result of this drug overdose, Archambault died on June 25.', 'In December 2006, plaintiff filed the present action against Haven Health and Hardesty on behalf of Archambault’s estate.', 'During discovery, Hardesty gave deposition testimony acknowledging that she was negligent when she mistakenly administered the incorrect dosage of morphine solution to Archambault. She also testified at her deposition that she was a registered nurse in Rhode Island and a full-time employee of Haven Health at the time of Archambault’s death. 3', 'It is well established that when evaluating a motion for summary judgment, a court must “view[] the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party * * *.” See Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 126-27 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Travelers Property and Casualty Corp v. Old Republic Insurance Co., 847 A.2d 303, 307 (R.I. 2004)). Columbia notes in its filings with this Court that it “generally does not disagree with [plaintiff’s] statement of the factual and procedural posture of this action,” although it would characterize the insurance contract’s language differently. Therefore, the opinion’s summary of the underlying facts is drawn largely from plaintiff’s filings. 4', 'We note that plaintiff refers to “Deborah Hardesty” throughout her filings, but that other documents indicate that Hardesty’s correct first name is Denise.', '-2-', 'When plaintiff filed her complaint, the Greenville Haven Health facility was insured under a claims-made professional liability insurance policy issued by Columbia (Columbia policy). The Columbia policy insured both Haven Health as an entity, as well as “any individual who is or becomes [a Haven Health] ‘employee’ * * * during the ‘policy period’ but only for ‘professional services’ performed on [Haven Health’s] behalf.” 5 This policy limited coverage for professional liability to $1 million per claim and $3 million in the aggregate. However, the policy also contained a self-insured retention endorsement (SIR Endorsement) requiring Haven Health to pay the first $2 million of “all ‘damages’ and all ‘claim expenses’ resulting from * * * each ‘claim’ under the Professional Liability Coverage Form.” The policy described the parties’ obligations under the SIR Endorsement as follows:', '“[Columbia’s] obligation to pay ‘damages’ and ‘claim expenses’ as', 'a result of a ‘claim’ is in excess of the Self-Insured Retention.', '[Haven Health] [is] required to pay all ‘damages’ and ‘claim', 'expenses’ up to the amount of the Self-Insured Retention listed', 'herein. The Limits of Liability set forth on the Declarations Page', 'are in excess of the Self-Insured Retention regardless of [Haven', 'Health’s] financial ability or inability to pay the Self-Insured', 'Retention and in no event are we required to make any payments', 'within [Haven Health’s] Self-Insured Retention.” Thus, under the terms of the policy, Columbia’s obligation to pay on a professional liability claim would arise only to the extent that the damages and expenses exceeded $2 million, and Haven Health would be directly responsible for paying any amounts less than that. 5', 'The policy defined “employee” as “a person, whose work is engaged and directed by [Haven Health],” but excluding independent contractors. The term “professional services” was defined to include “healthcare services,” which, in turn, meant “services performed by an Insured to care for or assist [Haven Health] patients provided such Insured is licensed; trained or qualified to perform such services in the jurisdiction in which such services are rendered.”', '-3-', 'In late 2007 or early 2008, Haven Health and two related entities—Haven Eldercare of New England, LLC (HENE) and Haven Eldercare, LLC (HE) 6—filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 7 The next summer, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of the assets of Haven Health, HENE, and HE, and dismissed their cases (without a discharge). In 2008, Hardesty filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and she obtained a discharge later that year.', 'In 2009, plaintiff amended her complaint to add Columbia as a defendant and to assert two counts against Columbia directly, based on G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2.4, which permits an injured party to proceed against an insurer when the insured has filed for bankruptcy. The plaintiff also added HENE and HE as defendants. 8 Haven Health, HENE, and HE failed to respond to plaintiff’s amended complaint, and the Superior Court entered default judgment against each of those defendants on November 20, 2009.

Finally, plaintiff urges that we read the Columbia policy’s language to require Columbia to pay prejudgment and postjudgment interest on the full amount of the judgment entered against the insureds, rather than on only that portion of the judgment that is within the per-claim limit.

Under § 42-14.1-2(a), “[t]he director of the department of business regulation is * * * authorized to establish rules and regulations allowing persons or entities with sufficient financial resources to be self-insurers.” To date, the Department of Business Regulation (DBR) has not promulgated any such 12', 'The plaintiff also argues on appeal that the hearing justice erred in concluding that she lacked standing to proceed directly against Columbia under G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2 (permitting direct action against an insurer by an injured party who has obtained a judgment against the insured). However, it is undisputed that plaintiff has standing under § 27-7-2.4 (permitting an injured party to proceed directly against an insurer when the insured has filed for bankruptcy protection). Because our holding does not depend on which of these statutes confers standing, and the parties agree that plaintiff has standing under the latter, it is unnecessary for us to address this argument.', '-7- regulations, and the parties disagree on whether healthcare providers may lawfully self-insure in the absence of DBR action.', 'The plaintiff contends that self-insurance does not constitute insurance coverage and, thus the SIR Endorsement in Haven Health’s policy did not satisfy the minimum coverage levels purportedly required by § 42-14.1-2(a). In particular, plaintiff notes that, under the Columbia policy’s SIR Endorsement, Haven Health was required to make all payments up to $2 million, rendering Columbia’s coverage meaningless for any claims below that amount. The plaintiff argues that unlike policies with deductibles, in which the insurer (rather than the claimant) must seek to recover the deductible amount from the insured, SIR endorsements frustrate the public- protection purpose of the statute. In short, plaintiff argues that “self-insurance is no insurance at all,” Guerico v. Hertz Corp., 358 N.E.2d 261, 264 (N.Y. 1976), and cannot possibly satisfy the minimum coverage thresholds that she argues are required under Rhode Island law. Thus, plaintiff urges that this Court should declare the SIR Endorsement “void as against public policy to the extent of the statutorily mandated minimum insurance limits.” The plaintiff acknowledges that not all self-insured retentions violate public policy and recognizes that Rhode Island law permits self-insurance in several other contexts. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 28-36-1 (requiring employers to maintain workers’ compensation insurance but permitting self-insurance); G.L. 1956 § 31-33-9 (permitting self-insurance for certain motor vehicles provided that the State Division of Motor Vehicles “is satisfied that the person is possessed and will continue to be possessed of the ability to pay judgment obtained against the person”). The plaintiff argues, however, that self-insurance is not permitted in the medical-liability-coverage context because neither the General Assembly nor the DBR have expressly permitted it, and she emphasizes that § 42-14.1-2(a) merely “authorizes the DBR ‘to establish rules and regulations allowing persons', '-8- or entities with sufficient financial resources to be self-insurers.’” (Quoting § 42-14.1-2(a) (emphasis added by the party)).', 'The plaintiff suggests that since both Haven Health and Hardesty filed for bankruptcy shortly after plaintiff filed her action, neither would have been deemed by the DBR to be sufficiently financially stable to qualify for self-insurance.', 'To support her argument, plaintiff cites Ryan v. Knoller, 695 A.2d 990, 992 (R.I. 1997), in which this Court held that an intoxication exclusion in an automobile rental and insurance agreement was void because it limited statutorily required liability coverage. The plaintiff also asserts that cases from other jurisdictions have declared self-insurance void as against public policy. See Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, 273 S.E.2d 24, 27, 28 (Ga. Ct. App. 1980); Thomas v. Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership, 588 So. 2d 711, 720 (La. Ct. App. 1991).', 'Columbia responds that § 42-14.1-2(a) does not prohibit healthcare providers from self- insuring and, in fact, “expressly provides that a health care provider may be self insured.” Thus, Columbia argues, “that § 42-14.1-2 specifically authorizes the self-insurance of health care facilities conclusively establishes that the SIR [Endorsement] of the Columbia Policy does not violate public policy.” Columbia notes that the DBR has not promulgated any regulations setting forth the financial prerequisites for self-insurance; and it argues that “if the General Assembly had wanted to proscribe the use of self-insurance by health care providers until the DBR promulgated appropriate regulations it could easily have stated as such, which would have placed insurers on notice.” Finally, Columbia asserts that the case law cited by plaintiff is either distinguishable or inapplicable.', 'In particular, Columbia contends that self-insurance is fundamentally different from the intoxication exclusion that this Court held violated public policy in Ryan, 695 A.2d at 992, because an exclusion “operates to bring a covered loss outside', '-9- of coverage,” whereas a “satisfaction of an SIR is a condition precedent of coverage.” Finally, Columbia argues that the two cases cited by plaintiff from outside this jurisdiction are inapplicable because in both of those cases the parties failed to demonstrate that the insureds had satisfied the relevant requirements for self-insurance under those states’ laws. See Commercial Union Insurance Co., 273 S.E.2d at 27; Thomas, 588 So. 2d at 721.', 'Although plaintiff emphasizes public policy in urging that this Court declare the present SIR Endorsement void, we need not undertake a public policy analysis here because we read § 42-14.1-2(a) to preclude Rhode Island healthcare providers from self-insuring unless and until the DBR promulgates regulations setting forth parameters for self-insurance. As we have noted on various occasions, “[w]hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is our responsibility to give the words of the enactment their plain and ordinary meaning.” Mendes, 41 A.3d at 1002 (quoting Generation Realty, LLC, 21 A.3d at 259). Here, the statutory language at issue provides that the DBR director is “authorized to establish rules and regulations allowing persons or entities with sufficient financial resources to be self-insurers.” Section 42-14.1-2(a) (emphasis added). Having carefully read that provision, we conclude that before any self- insurance may be incorporated into an insurance policy governed by § 42-14.1-2(a), the DBR first must promulgate a regulatory framework expressly “allowing” for self-insurance.', 'In particular, we note that the General Assembly employed the term “allow,” which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “[t]o let do or happen; permit” or, alternatively, “[t]o make provision for; assign.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 48 (4th ed. 2000). Under these definitions of the term “allow,” before a Rhode Island healthcare provider lawfully may self-insure, the DBR is required to take the affirmative step of “allowing” self-insurance and defining the conditions under which “persons or entities” possess “sufficient financial resources', '- 10 - to be self-insurers.” See § 42-14.1-2(a). Thus, unless and until the DBR promulgates regulations that expressly make provision for self-insurance by healthcare providers, by its plain language, the final sentence of § 42-14.1-2(a) does not permit the SIR Endorsement that appears in the Columbia policy.', 'This reading of the statute also comports with the treatment of Rhode Island self-insurers in other contexts. For example, § 31-33-9 allows for any person with a fleet of more than twenty-five vehicles to self-insure, but only upon “obtaining a certificate of self-insurance issued by the division of motor vehicles,” which may be obtained only if the Division of Motor Vehicles is “satisfied that the person is possessed and will continue to be possessed of the ability to pay judgment obtained against the person.” Thus, in the automobile insurance context, § 31- 33-9 requires that, as a condition precedent to self-insurance, the Division of Motor Vehicles take the affirmative steps of reviewing an applicant’s financial stability and issuing a certificate of self-insurance. Similarly, in the workers’ compensation context, Rhode Island law, § 28-36- 1(b)(1), permits covered employers to “apply for approval to self insure,” but it requires, among other things, that the employer “furnish[] to the director of labor and training satisfactory proof of his or her financial ability to pay directly to injured employees or their dependents the compensation, and by furnishing security, indemnity, or a bond in kind and in amount satisfactory to the director.”', 'Section 28-36-1(a)(2)(i).', 'Therefore, as with automobile self- insurance, before an employer may self-insure, it must demonstrate financial responsibility, and the relevant state agency must act upon that employer’s application. Although the General Assembly’s directive to the DBR about the circumstances under which it may permit self- insurance by healthcare providers was far less detailed and specific than its directives to the Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Labor and Training, we nonetheless conclude,', '- 11 - based on the plain language of § 42-14.1-2(a), that, before Rhode Island healthcare providers may self-insure, the DBR is required to first take the affirmative step of “establish[ing] rules and regulations allowing persons or entities with sufficient financial resources to be self-insurers.”', 'We also note that some authorities have characterized self-insurance as “the antithesis of insurance” because it fails to shift the risk of loss away from the insured, and we agree with the general proposition that “[t]o meet the conceptual definition of self-insurance, an entity would have to engage in the same sorts of underwriting procedures that insurance companies employ.” 1A Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance 3d § 10:1 & n.1 (rev. ed. 2010). Here, the record is devoid of any indication that any effort was undertaken to ascertain Haven Health’s risk of loss and financial ability to meet that potential loss. Moreover, we believe that the fact that Haven Health filed for bankruptcy protection less than a year and a half after the Columbia policy was issued would bring into question whether at the time the Columbia policy became effective, Haven Health was in a financial position to adequately self-insure against the first $2 million of loss pursuant to the SIR Endorsement.', 'Because the DBR has not yet promulgated “rules and regulations allowing persons or entities with sufficient financial resources to be self-insurers,” we hold that the Columbia policy’s SIR Endorsement is invalid under § 42-14.1-2(a). Therefore, plaintiff may recover from Columbia, even though her judgment against Haven Health does not exceed the $2 million SIR Endorsement amount.', '- 12 -', 'B', 'Mandatory Minimum Policy Limits Under § 42-14.1-2 and Insurance Regulation 21', 'The plaintiff argues that § 42-14.1-2(a) 13 or Insurance Regulation 21, 14 or both, mandate minimum coverage requirements of $100,000 per claim, $300,000 in the aggregate, for all professional liability policies issued to Rhode Island healthcare providers. Columbia responds that there is no such statutory mandate because the statute authorizes, but does not require, the DBR to act, and the minimum coverage requirements set forth in the statute will become effective if, and only if, the DBR exercises its discretion by promulgating rules and regulations setting minimum coverage levels. Additionally, Columbia asserts that Insurance Regulation 21’s general reference back to the statute does not constitute an exercise of that agency’s discretion and thus does not convert the statute’s permissive minimum coverage requirements into mandatory ones.', 'We note that at no point during this proceeding has plaintiff asserted that she is entitled to recover any damages in excess of the per-claim minimum coverage limit of $100,000 that she 13', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-14.1-2(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“The director of business regulation shall promulgate rules and', 'regulations requiring all licensed medical and dental', 'professional[s] and all licensed health care providers to be covered', 'by professional liability insurance insuring the practitioner for', 'claims of bodily injury or death arising out of malpractice,', 'professional error, or mistake.

Code R. § 21:4(D).', '- 13 - contends § 42-14.1-2(a) requires. 15 The plaintiff also represented to this Court during oral arguments that she was seeking only the purported per-claim minimum coverage amount because it was her position that § 42-14.1-2(a) would not require Columbia to pay any amounts above and beyond that statutory minimum. Because plaintiff consistently has taken the position that she is entitled only to $100,000 of her damages award (plus interest), we need not determine whether that statute actually limits her recovery in this way. We already have determined the SIR Endorsement in the Columbia policy to be invalid, and we hold that plaintiff should receive the $100,000 in damages to which she consistently has argued she is entitled. Thus, we need not determine whether the $100,000 per-claim minimum specified in § 42-14.1-2(a) currently is mandatory (and therefore applicable to all policies insuring Rhode Island healthcare providers), or whether it becomes effective only if and when the DBR exercises its discretion by promulgating regulations setting forth minimum professional liability insurance coverage requirements for healthcare providers.', 'C', 'Separate Treatment of Insureds Under the Policy', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that because § 42-14.1-2(a) requires “all licensed medical and dental professional[s] and all licensed health care providers” to maintain at least $100,000 liability coverage per claim, Columbia is obligated to cover $200,000 of plaintiff’s total damages award—$100,000 for the claim against Haven Health, a licensed healthcare provider, and $100,000 for the claim against Hardesty, a licensed medical professional. (Emphasis added.) 15', 'The plaintiff does, however, argue that Columbia is obligated to provide this minimum coverage for Haven Health and Hardesty separately, thus requiring Columbia to pay $200,000 of plaintiff’s total damages award. Still, she does not assert that she is entitled to any amount greater than the ostensible statutory minimum for her claims against each insured. We consider this to be a separate and distinct argument, which we address infra.', '- 14 - The plaintiff points to case law from other jurisdictions to support her reading of the word “and” in § 42-14.1-2(a). See Lewinski v. Commonwealth, 852 A.2d 1270, 1277 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2004) (deferring to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department’s determination that “‘shared limits’ policy language violated the [statutory] requirement that the professional corporation maintain separate basic liability coverage”); Haislip v. Southern Heritage Insurance Co., 492 S.E.2d 135, 137 (Va. 1997) (holding that a Virginia statute mandating that motor vehicle insurance policies “contain ‘a provision insuring the named insured, and any other person using * * * the motor vehicle * * *’” required the insurer to provide separate coverage for the vehicle’s owner and permissive user).', 'Columbia responds that plaintiff waived her right to make this argument to this Court when she failed to raise it in the first instance in the summary-judgment proceedings before the Superior Court. We agree. “It is axiomatic that this [C]ourt will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal that was not properly presented before the trial court.” State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1258 (R.I. 1998)). The plaintiff acknowledges that she did not make this argument below, but urges that we apply an exception to the raise-or-waive rule apparently recognized by some federal courts under which an appellate court will consider questions of law not posed to the trial court. See, e.g., United States v. Kin-Hong, 110 F.3d 103, 116 (1st Cir. 1997) (“While it is true that, as a general matter, federal courts of appeals do not rule on issues not decided in the district court, * * * we do have discretion to address issues not reached by the district court when the question is essentially legal and the record is complete.”). However, although “[s]ome courts seem to be slightly less exigent about the raise or waive rule * * *, this Court has remained quite exigent with respect to the raise or waive rule * * * and we continue to believe that the rule is jurisprudentially sound.” Pollard v.', '- 15 - Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 n.11 (R.I. 2005). Here, plaintiff had the opportunity to make this argument when she moved for summary judgment against defendant, but she failed to do so. 16 Thus, because plaintiff did not present this argument to the hearing justice below, we hold that plaintiff waived her right to assert this argument here, and her recovery for damages is limited to the $100,000 claim amount that she asserted below.', 'D', 'Prejudgment and Postjudgment Interest', 'Finally, the parties disagree as to the amount of prejudgment and postjudgment interest that Columbia is required to pay pursuant to the policy language. The “Supplemental Payments” section of the Columbia policy provides that “[Columbia] will pay with respect to any ‘claim’ * * * prejudgment interest and postjudgment interest that is awarded in connection with a judgment made against the Insured, or that portion of the judgment that is within the applicable limits of insurance.” The parties disagree on the meaning of this provision. The plaintiff argues that because a comma and the disjunctive term “or” separate the initial clause establishing 16', 'The plaintiff attempts to draw a distinction between her case and the well-established case law from this Court, arguing that in other cases the raise-or-waive rule applied because the issues should have been raised at trial, whereas here, the case was disposed of through summary judgment and thus issues “remain open to the Superior Court for decision upon remand * * *.” However, it is clear that when plaintiff moved for summary judgment below, she sought complete resolution of all her claims against Columbia, and thus intended her motion to be a complete statement of her legal arguments. For example, although plaintiff titled her motion a “partial” motion for summary judgment, she also sought Rule 54(b) certification of final judgment on all claims against Columbia. See Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure (permitting an entry of final judgment as to some but not all parties or claims). Additionally, plaintiff argued to the lower court that her “motion for partial summary judgment [against Columbia] [was] distinct and separate from the remaining claims brought against the owners of the nursing facility in attempting to pierce the corporate veil,” further indicating that she was seeking complete resolution of any and all claims she may have had against Columbia. Thus, because we conclude that plaintiff intended to adjudicate all of her claims against Columbia through this motion, rather than preserving some for trial, our established case law applying the raise-or-waive rule to issues that could have been raised at trial applies with equal force here.', '- 16 - Columbia’s obligation to pay prejudgment and postjudgment interest from the final clause limiting interest to the amount of the judgment that falls within the policy limits, the policy provision actually sets out two alternative methods for determining interest (one that permits interest based on the full amount of the judgment, and a second that limits the interest calculation to only that portion of the award that is within the policy limits). The plaintiff asserts that she should be able to benefit from the method for interest calculation that is most advantageous to her. Alternatively, plaintiff argues that the two clauses, taken together, create an ambiguity that should be construed in her favor. Thus, plaintiff asserts, Columbia is obligated to pay $100,000 toward plaintiff’s damages award as well as prejudgment and postjudgment interest calculated on the basis of the total damages award, i.e., $256, 881.', 'Columbia, on the other hand, maintains that the final clause of this policy provision modifies the preceding clause, thereby limiting prejudgment and postjudgment interest to only that portion of the judgment actually covered by the policy.', 'Thus, Columbia argues, any prejudgment and postjudgment interest that it is obligated to pay must be determined with reference only to $100,000 of plaintiff’s damages, not the entire judgment amount.', '“It is well established that this [C]ourt applies the rules for construction of contracts when interpreting an insurance policy * * * .” Lynch v.

Holyoke Mutual Insurance Co. in Salem, 658 A.2d 18, 20 (R.I. 1995)). “The necessary prerequisite to this Court’s departure from the literal language of a policy is a finding that the policy is ambiguous. In order to make such a determination of ambiguity, we read a policy in its entirety, giving words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.” Sjogren v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 703 A.2d 608, 610 (R.I. 1997). “We do not engage in ‘mental gymnastics * * * to read ambiguity into a policy where', '- 17 - none is present.’” Id. (quoting Mallane, 658 A.2d at 20). “If, however, a policy’s terms are ambiguous or capable of more than one reasonable meaning, the policy will be strictly construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer.” Id.', 'To support her argument, the plaintiff cites to Fratus v. Republic Western Insurance Co., 147 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998). There, the First Circuit held that policy language requiring the insurer to pay “[a]ll interest accruing after the entry of judgment” unambiguously obligated the insurer to pay interest on the full amount of the judgment (over $3 million), rather than on only that portion of the judgment that was within the policy’s coverage limit ($25,000). Id. at 27, 28- 29. By contrast, here, the Columbia policy language is not as sweeping or general, and we disagree with the plaintiff’s argument that the policy provides for two alternate methods for determining how much interest is owed. Instead, we are of the opinion that a fair reading of the policy provision limits Columbia’s obligation to pay interest only on that portion of the award that falls within the policy limits. Thus, because we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to receive $100,000 under the policy, see Section III, B, supra, prejudgment and postjudgment interest in this case must be calculated on the basis of that limited amount rather than on the full amount of the plaintiff’s judgment against Haven Health and its affiliated entities.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court, and we remand the record to the Superior Court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $100,000, plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest calculated on the basis of that amount.', '- 18 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Tracie Peloquin, as Administratrix of the Estate of Pearl E.', 'Archambault v.

98,"Firlando Rivera : v. : State of Rhode Island. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, and Indeglia, JJ. OPINION Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Firlando Rivera (Rivera or applicant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying his application for postconviction relief. On appeal, Rivera contends that the hearing justice erred in rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 23, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel A Trial and Appeal The facts underlying this case are set forth in State v. Rivera, 839 A.2d 497 (R.I. 2003), in which this Court upheld Rivera’s judgments of conviction. In short, in the early morning hours of November 23, 1997, Rivera and three acquaintances—Hector Vasquez, John Muniz, -1- and Dwight Withee—became involved in a confrontation with Edward “Chipper” Wilson IV and Robert K. Rhoades at the Weiner Palace in Woonsocket. 1 See Rivera, 839 A.2d at 499. What began as a verbal altercation escalated into physical violence that ultimately led to Wilson’s death after he was shot in the head. Id. On October 19, 1999, a Superior Court jury convicted Rivera of first-degree murder and three firearms charges. The trial justice denied Rivera’s motion for a new trial on October 27, 1999. Several months later, on February 3, 2000, the trial justice sentenced Rivera to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for murder. He also imposed a ten-year suspended sentence and a ten-year probationary term for one of the firearms charges; for each of the other two firearms charges, he imposed a ten-year jail term. The sentences on the firearms charges were to run concurrently with the life sentence. The trial justice also declared Rivera to be a habitual offender in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21. Pursuant to that statute, he sentenced Rivera to an additional twenty years in jail for which he would be ineligible to seek parole; this sentence was to run consecutively to the life sentence. Judgment of conviction was entered thereafter. Rivera then timely appealed his convictions to this Court. After reviewing the record, we affirmed his convictions on all counts and denied his appeal on November 19, 2003. See Rivera, 839 A.2d at 504. 1 Although our opinion did not identify Rivera’s three acquaintances, those men were identified during the postconviction-relief hearing. Hector Vasquez’s name is spelled differently at different points in the record. -2- B Postconviction-Relief Proceedings On February 27, 2004, Rivera filed a pro se application for postconviction relief. Rivera was appointed counsel about one month later. On March 29, 2006, counsel filed a verified complaint in support of Rivera’s application for postconviction relief. Unlike Rivera’s original application, which contained allegations of a general nature, the verified complaint contained seven specific grounds as to which he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Those grounds were as follows: (1) attorney conflict of interest; (2) failure to raise a third-party perpetrator defense; (3) failure to pursue a motion to suppress; (4) failure to investigate or conduct pretrial preparation; (5) failure to conduct pretrial investigation; (6) failure to raise a motion for a speedy trial; and (7) failure to preserve issues at trial. In a later filing, Rivera abandoned several of these arguments, stating that he intended to press only four grounds of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel: that his attorneys were conflicted in their representation of him; that they failed to adequately investigate and prepare for trial; that they failed to pursue a motion to suppress; and that they failed to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. An evidentiary hearing on Rivera’s application was held on February 10 and 11, 2011. 2 The justice who presided over that hearing had also presided over Rivera’s jury trial in 1999. Three witnesses testified at the hearing: Matthew Smith, one of the two attorneys who represented Rivera at trial; John Verdecchia, Smith’s co-counsel; and Dwight Withee, an 2 The record offers little explanation for the extraordinary delay in this case. In a letter dated September 7, 2010, Rivera’s postconviction counsel explained to the hearing justice that “[m]uch of that [delay] has to do with the fact that * * * [Rivera’s] strategy has changed several times.” We note that the state did not file a memorandum in response to Rivera’s application for postconviction relief until November 14, 2008. -3- acquaintance of Rivera’s who was with him at the Weiner Palace at the time of the shooting. Below, we summarize the relevant evidence adduced at the hearing. i Testimony Concerning Conflict of Interest Rivera’s primary argument at the postconviction-relief hearing was that his trial attorneys had represented him while laboring under a conflict of interest. This conflict, Rivera argued, stemmed from Smith’s and Verdecchia’s representation of Hector Vasquez. Vasquez was an acquaintance of Rivera’s and was with him at the Weiner Palace on the night of the murder. Rivera contended that an “inherent” conflict of interest resulted from Smith’s and Verdecchia’s representation of Vasquez during a key period of their representation of Rivera. Rivera’s postconviction counsel elicited testimony from both Smith and Verdecchia about this purported conflict of interest. Smith testified that he and Verdecchia jointly represented Rivera in connection with the charges that stemmed from Wilson’s murder. 3 Although Smith did not open a file on Rivera until January 7, 1998, he stated that he and Verdecchia represented Rivera as of December 1997, when Rivera was presented in the Superior Court as a violator of a previously imposed probation. Smith explained that in late 1997 he and Verdecchia also represented Vasquez in connection with federal narcotics charges that were unrelated to Wilson’s murder. Smith’s representation of Vasquez on these charges concluded when Vasquez entered a plea in federal court on June 19, 1998. Smith confirmed on cross-examination that Rivera’s murder charge and Vasquez’s narcotics charges were “entirely separate and distinct” and that those two cases had “absolutely nothing to do with [each] other.” 3 Although Smith and Verdecchia were not formally associated in the practice of law, both of them testified that they worked together on cases from time to time. -4- Smith testified that shortly after the murder occurred Verdecchia brought Vasquez to the Woonsocket police station to give a statement in connection with the investigation. Vasquez’s statement was admitted as a full exhibit at the postconviction-relief hearing. In that statement, Vasquez told the police (1) that he was in the restroom at the Weiner Palace and that he came out when he heard shots; (2) that he did not see Rivera fight with Wilson; and (3) that he did not see Rivera shoot Wilson. Vasquez told the police that, before going to the station to give his statement, he had spoken with Rivera by telephone. When an officer asked Vasquez whether Rivera had told him “what he [Rivera] allegedly did,” Vasquez replied that Rivera had not done so. In addition, Vasquez told the police that when he advised Rivera of his intent to give a statement, Rivera told him: “That’s your decision.” Smith testified that although he “would like to think” that he discussed with Rivera the issue of a possible conflict concerning the concurrent representation of Vasquez, he was “not prepared to say under oath” that he had such a conversation. Smith did recall that he and Verdecchia had Rivera “sign something related to a potential conflict of interest.” Smith was “certain” that he had not brought this issue to the court’s attention before trial. Smith averred, however, that Rivera’s family—and perhaps Rivera himself—knew that Vasquez would be giving a statement and that Verdecchia would be present. Verdecchia testified that he, too, was representing Vasquez when Vasquez spoke with police after the murder. 4 Verdecchia did not specify exactly what his representation of Vasquez on November 23, 1997, entailed; he testified only that Vasquez had contacted him and had come 4 Although the record is somewhat unclear on this subject, Verdecchia testified that he had previously represented Vasquez when he pled nolo contendere to a charge of simple assault in October 1997. Vasquez was later presented as a violator in December 1997, and several new charges were also filed against him. The new charges, which included narcotics offenses, were ultimately prosecuted in federal court. As noted above, Smith represented Vasquez on those charges, which were resolved through a plea agreement in June 1998. -5- to his office. Verdecchia explained that he felt Rivera’s defense would be bolstered by Vasquez’s statement to the police. During cross-examination, he elaborated on this subject: “ * * * [T]he main purpose for bringing Mr. Vasquez to the police station to give a statement was not because the Woonsocket Police considered him a viable suspect. My impression, then, as it is now, is that the Woonsocket Police considered him to be a percipient witness because he was at the site, at the scene on the night in question. Now, after speaking with Mr. Vasquez about the events on that night, we decided—and this was a collective agreement— that we would bring [Vasquez] up to the Woonsocket Police station * * * in order to give testimony, which we felt was actually beneficial to Mr. Rivera.” Verdecchia did not recall having Rivera execute a written waiver of any conflict that might exist in connection with his and Smith’s representation of Vasquez. Like Smith, Verdecchia did not disclose to the trial court any potential conflict that might have stemmed from his representation of Rivera and Vasquez because “[he] never felt there was a conflict.” When asked on cross-examination whether he “in any way [felt] any allegiance to Mr. Vasquez that prevented [him] from effectively representing [Rivera],” Verdecchia stated: “Absolutely not.” ii Testimony Concerning Strategic Decisions Rivera also sought to prove that his attorneys had erred in making two major strategic decisions: abandoning a motion to suppress evidence of photo arrays, and deciding not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. Smith and Verdecchia explained their reasoning underlying both these decisions. As for their decision not to pursue a motion to suppress evidence, Smith and Verdecchia both testified that they felt the motion would be futile for two reasons. First, they agreed that there was nothing inherently suggestive about the photo arrays that would provide grounds for a motion to suppress. Second, they believed it would be better to highlight -6- some irregularities with the photo arrays through cross-examination at trial rather than “tip[ ] [their] hand” at a suppression hearing. Verdecchia elaborated on this decision as follows: “ * * * [W]e initially filed the motion to suppress out of an abundance of caution and, at the time we filed it, thought that, perhaps, there might be a ground to suppress the identification. But, after doing more detailed review, we felt that [the] motion would in all likelihood fail, because although there were some irregularities in the methodology that was employed by the Woonsocket Police Department, * * *, we felt that would go to the weight as opposed to the admissibility of the * * * photo pack[s] * * *. “ * * * Had we pursued what ultimately would have been an unsuccessful suppression motion, we essentially would have tipped our hand, not only to * * * the prosecutor, but, more importantly, to the police officers who would be testifying, not only at the suppression hearing, but then at the trial.” As for their decision not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense, both attorneys testified that this defense was not supported by either the discovery or their own investigation of the case. Smith and Verdecchia both noted that Rivera was the only person who had been identified as the shooter, and both attorneys testified that Rivera did not suggest to them that another person had been the shooter. On cross-examination, Verdecchia confirmed that “[Rivera’s] case was reviewed in intimate detail, and also in consultation with [Rivera], and, based on those two factors, we decided to proceed with what we thought was the most effective defense * * *.” In response to an inquiry from the hearing justice, Verdecchia testified that he and Smith had discussed strategic decisions with Rivera and that Rivera “was inclined to agree [with those decisions] after [they were] explained to him.” Withee also provided testimony relating to Rivera’s claim that his attorneys should have pursued a third-party perpetrator defense. He testified that he and Vasquez were both at the Weiner Palace on the night Wilson was murdered. Withee either saw or heard the altercation -7- that led to Wilson’s death. 5 He then “decided to get out of the area * * *.” As he left, he heard gunshots; Withee then ran away from the scene. He testified that Vasquez was by his side at this point and that there was no way that Vasquez could have fired the bullet that killed Wilson. iii The Hearing Justice’s Decision After both parties had rested, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision in which he denied Rivera’s application for postconviction relief. The hearing justice addressed and, in turn, rejected each of Rivera’s arguments underlying his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. As for Rivera’s contention that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to pursue a motion to suppress, the hearing justice noted that there was “nothing suggestive” about the photo arrays that were introduced into evidence at trial. Crediting Smith’s and Verdecchia’s testimony, the hearing justice concluded that trial counsel had made a prudent tactical decision not to pursue the motion to suppress. He noted that Rivera’s attorneys were “rather successful[ ]” in exposing irregularities with the photo arrays at trial and that the Woonsocket police probably were “somewhat embarrassed” as a result. As to Rivera’s assertion that his attorneys were ineffective in failing to pursue a third- party perpetrator defense, the hearing justice stated that Smith and Verdecchia “rightly decided that it was not a viable theory of defense.” The hearing justice noted that it was Rivera, not Vasquez, who had a physical altercation with Wilson. He also found that no one ever identified Vasquez as the person who shot the victim and that Rivera was the only person who was so identified. Under these facts, the hearing justice characterized Smith’s and Verdecchia’s decision concerning a third-party perpetrator defense as “sound.” 5 Withee provided conflicting testimony as to whether he saw or merely heard the altercation. -8- Finally, as to Rivera’s argument that his attorneys were ineffective because they were conflicted in their representation of him, the hearing justice found that Rivera’s attorneys neither struggled to serve two clients nor actively represented conflicting interests. Concluding his remarks from the bench, the hearing justice observed that Rivera’s conviction was not the result of his attorneys’ performance, but rather of the weight of the credible evidence against him. The hearing justice accordingly denied Rivera’s application for postconviction relief, and an order to that effect was entered on February 18, 2011. Thereafter, Rivera timely appealed to this Court. II Issues on Appeal On appeal, Rivera contends that the hearing justice erred in rejecting his argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Reiterating the arguments his counsel advanced at the postconviction-relief hearing, Rivera argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorneys had (1) represented him while laboring under a conflict of interest; (2) failed to pursue a motion to suppress; and (3) failed to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. In his verified complaint supporting his application, Rivera set forth several additional grounds of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Only the three grounds noted above have been properly preserved for our review, and we deem the following grounds of appeal to be waived: (1) the adequacy of his attorneys’ pretrial investigation and preparation; (2) their failure to move for a speedy trial; and (3) their failure to preserve certain issues for appeal. 6 See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) 6 At the postconviction-relief hearing, Rivera adduced testimony relevant to the adequacy of his attorneys’ pretrial investigation and preparation. He did not, however, raise this issue during closing arguments at the hearing, and he did not object when the hearing justice did not discuss this issue when he rendered his bench decision. Accordingly, we deem that issue to be waived. -9- (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”). III Standard of Review Rhode Island’s statutory postconviction remedy is set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10. Section 10-9.1-1 enumerates the circumstances in which “one who has been convicted of a crime may seek collateral review of that conviction * * *.” See Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 601 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 16 (R.I. 2012)). In reviewing an application for postconviction relief, “[t]his Court will not impinge upon the fact-finding function of a hearing justice * * * ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.’” Id. (quoting Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011)). We employ a de novo standard of review with regard to “questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights * * *.” Anderson, 45 A.3d at 601 (quoting State v. Laurence, 18 A.3d 512, 521 (R.I. 2011)). Even when applying the de novo standard of review to such issues, however, “we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference in conducting our review.” Id. (quoting Rice, 38 A.3d at 16). “An applicant who files an application for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted.” Id. (quoting Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 901 n.7 (R.I. 2008)). - 10 - IV Discussion Criminal defendants have the right to the effective assistance of counsel under both the United States Constitution and the Rhode Island Constitution. See State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 252 (R.I. 2004). When evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court employs the test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). See Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941. In Pelletier v. State, 966 A.2d 1237 (R.I. 2009), we summarized that test as follows: “First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction * * * resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.” Pelletier, 966 A.2d at 1241 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687). As we have previously recognized, the United States Supreme Court has “cautioned that the Strickland standard should not be applied overbroadly * * *.” Larngar v. Wall, 918 A.2d 850, 864 (R.I. 2007) (citing Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 165 (1986)). “[W]hen determining whether an attorney’s conduct amount[s] to ineffective assistance of counsel, ‘a court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of conduct acceptable * * * so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct * * *.’” Id. (quoting Nix, 475 U.S. at 165). There is “a strong presumption * * * that an attorney’s performance falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound strategy * * *.” Rice, 38 A.3d at 17 (quoting Ouimette v. State, 785 A.2d 1132, 1138-39 (R.I. 2001)). Keeping this presumption in mind, we now address each of Rivera’s purported grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. - 11 - A Conflict of Interest A defendant cannot prevail on an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel merely by showing that his attorney had a potential conflict of interest during the representation. Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 946. “[I]n order to demonstrate a violation of his [or her] Sixth Amendment rights, a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his [or her] lawyer’s performance.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 636 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980)). The defendant must show “that the attorney ‘struggle[d] to serve two masters’ meaning that ‘[his or her] actions [or inactions] were motivated by divided loyalties’ and ‘lacked a sound strategic basis.’” Id. at 637 (quoting Simpson v. State, 769 A.2d 1257, 1267 (R.I. 2001)). In addition, the defendant must establish that his or her attorney’s actual conflict of interest harmed or impaired the defense, “although ‘prejudice’ need not be demonstrated.” Id. (quoting Simpson, 769 A.2d at 1267). Here, the hearing justice found that neither Smith nor Verdecchia “struggle[d] to serve two clients” or “actively represent[ed] conflicting interests.” He noted that “[a]ny prior representation of Vazquez [sic] had concluded * * * long before [Rivera’s] trial, in excess of a year.” Furthermore, the hearing justice observed that “Hector Vasquez was never a viable target to assign guilt in this case as a so-called third-party culprit * * *.” Furthermore, as we conclude in part IV-B, infra, Smith’s and Verdecchia’s actions had a sound strategic basis. It is significant that Vasquez, in his statement to the police, indicated that he did not see Rivera shoot Wilson. This suggests that Vasquez was an ally of Rivera’s rather than a potential source of conflict. Our precedent requires us to presume that Smith and Verdecchia were capable of correctly analyzing whether a conflict might result from their representation of both Rivera and - 12 - Vasquez. See Rice, 38 A.3d at 17. Affording the hearing justice’s findings deference, as we must, we cannot say that he erred in concluding that Rivera had not carried his burden of proof in this regard. B Tactical Decisions Rivera also contends that his attorneys were ineffective in failing to pursue a motion to suppress evidence and in failing to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. Both of these alleged grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel center on tactical decisions made by Smith and Verdecchia. “[I]t is well established that tactical decisions by trial counsel, even if ill- advised, do not by themselves constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.” Rice, 38 A.3d at 18 (quoting Vorgvongsa v. State, 785 A.2d 542, 549 (R.I. 2001)). “This Court ‘will not meticulously scrutinize an attorney’s reasoned judgment or strategic maneuver in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.’” Id. at 17 (quoting Brennan v. Vose, 764 A.2d 168, 173 (R.I. 2001)). Mindful of the deference we must afford to the hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, we conclude that neither of these tactical decisions made by trial counsel constituted constitutionally deficient representation. First, concerning the motion to suppress, we discern no error in the hearing justice’s finding that there was “nothing suggestive” about the photo arrays. Furthermore, the hearing justice credited the testimony of Smith and Verdecchia, who explained that they had made a strategic choice to expose irregularities with the photo arrays as they were presented at trial rather than at a suppression hearing. The hearing justice found that “the first prong of Strickland clearly [was] not violated, and there [had] been an utter failure to carry the burden of proof with regard to that claim.” We agree, and therefore hold that Rivera’s attorneys - 13 - did not render ineffective assistance of counsel in choosing not to pursue a motion to suppress evidence. Similarly, we must defer to the hearing justice’s findings of historical fact regarding trial counsels’ decision not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. In the context of an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, the issue is not whether the trial justice properly admitted or excluded evidence supporting a third-party perpetrator defense, but whether trial counsel should have pursued such a defense. 7 Although this Court has previously considered on direct appeal whether a trial justice properly excluded evidence relating to a third-party perpetrator defense, we have never before considered on collateral review whether an attorney’s failure to mount a third-party perpetrator defense deprived a defendant of his or her right to the effective assistance of counsel. We are guided in our resolution of this issue by Bryant v. Commissioner of Correction, 964 A.2d 1186 (Conn. 2009). In that case, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that “[i]t is not ineffective assistance of counsel * * * to decline to pursue a third party culpability defense when there is insufficient evidence to support that defense.” Id. at 1195. See also Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 913 n.24 (R.I. 2011) (no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could lie where counsel failed to raise a meritless defense). Here, both attorneys testified—and the hearing justice agreed—that a third-party perpetrator defense was not supported by either discovery or their own investigation of the case. The hearing justice found that “[a]t best, all [Smith and Verdecchia] had with respect to Hector 7 As the hearing justice noted, our precedent requires a defendant who wishes to present a defense that implicates a third party to make a “reasonably specific” offer of proof. State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005). Such an offer of proof must include “evidence of another person's motive to commit the crime with which a defendant is charged * * * in conjunction with other evidence tending to show the third person's opportunity to commit the crime and a proximate connection between that person and the actual commission of the crime.” Id. at 111 (quoting State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 825 (R.I 1980)). - 14 - Vasquez was his mere presence. * * * [T]hat, of course, was insufficient to mount [a] third-party culprit defense.” He also found that “Rivera himself * * * never even suggested that Vazquez [sic] should be blamed for [the murder].” We discern no error with the hearing justice’s findings on this issue, and therefore hold that Rivera’s attorneys did not render ineffective assistance of counsel by choosing not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. V Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case. - 15 - RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: Firlando Rivera v.

Krause ATTORNEYS ON APPEAL: For Applicant: Richard K. Corley, Esq. For State of Rhode Island: Aaron L. Weisman",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Firlando Rivera (Rivera or applicant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying his application for postconviction relief. On appeal, Rivera contends that the hearing justice erred in rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 23, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Trial and Appeal', 'The facts underlying this case are set forth in State v. Rivera, 839 A.2d 497 (R.I. 2003), in which this Court upheld Rivera’s judgments of conviction. In short, in the early morning hours of November 23, 1997, Rivera and three acquaintances—Hector Vasquez, John Muniz,', '-1- and Dwight Withee—became involved in a confrontation with Edward “Chipper” Wilson IV and Robert K. Rhoades at the Weiner Palace in Woonsocket. 1 See Rivera, 839 A.2d at 499. What began as a verbal altercation escalated into physical violence that ultimately led to Wilson’s death after he was shot in the head. Id.', 'On October 19, 1999, a Superior Court jury convicted Rivera of first-degree murder and three firearms charges. The trial justice denied Rivera’s motion for a new trial on October 27, 1999.', 'Several months later, on February 3, 2000, the trial justice sentenced Rivera to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for murder. He also imposed a ten-year suspended sentence and a ten-year probationary term for one of the firearms charges; for each of the other two firearms charges, he imposed a ten-year jail term. The sentences on the firearms charges were to run concurrently with the life sentence. The trial justice also declared Rivera to be a habitual offender in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21.', 'Pursuant to that statute, he sentenced Rivera to an additional twenty years in jail for which he would be ineligible to seek parole; this sentence was to run consecutively to the life sentence. Judgment of conviction was entered thereafter.', 'Rivera then timely appealed his convictions to this Court. After reviewing the record, we affirmed his convictions on all counts and denied his appeal on November 19, 2003. See Rivera, 839 A.2d at 504. 1', 'Although our opinion did not identify Rivera’s three acquaintances, those men were identified during the postconviction-relief hearing. Hector Vasquez’s name is spelled differently at different points in the record.', '-2-', 'B', 'Postconviction-Relief Proceedings', 'On February 27, 2004, Rivera filed a pro se application for postconviction relief. Rivera was appointed counsel about one month later. On March 29, 2006, counsel filed a verified complaint in support of Rivera’s application for postconviction relief. Unlike Rivera’s original application, which contained allegations of a general nature, the verified complaint contained seven specific grounds as to which he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Those grounds were as follows: (1) attorney conflict of interest; (2) failure to raise a third-party perpetrator defense; (3) failure to pursue a motion to suppress; (4) failure to investigate or conduct pretrial preparation; (5) failure to conduct pretrial investigation; (6) failure to raise a motion for a speedy trial; and (7) failure to preserve issues at trial. In a later filing, Rivera abandoned several of these arguments, stating that he intended to press only four grounds of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel: that his attorneys were conflicted in their representation of him; that they failed to adequately investigate and prepare for trial; that they failed to pursue a motion to suppress; and that they failed to mount a third-party perpetrator defense.', 'An evidentiary hearing on Rivera’s application was held on February 10 and 11, 2011. 2 The justice who presided over that hearing had also presided over Rivera’s jury trial in 1999. Three witnesses testified at the hearing: Matthew Smith, one of the two attorneys who represented Rivera at trial; John Verdecchia, Smith’s co-counsel; and Dwight Withee, an 2', 'The record offers little explanation for the extraordinary delay in this case. In a letter dated September 7, 2010, Rivera’s postconviction counsel explained to the hearing justice that “[m]uch of that [delay] has to do with the fact that * * * [Rivera’s] strategy has changed several times.” We note that the state did not file a memorandum in response to Rivera’s application for postconviction relief until November 14, 2008.', '-3- acquaintance of Rivera’s who was with him at the Weiner Palace at the time of the shooting. Below, we summarize the relevant evidence adduced at the hearing.', 'i', 'Testimony Concerning Conflict of Interest', 'Rivera’s primary argument at the postconviction-relief hearing was that his trial attorneys had represented him while laboring under a conflict of interest. This conflict, Rivera argued, stemmed from Smith’s and Verdecchia’s representation of Hector Vasquez. Vasquez was an acquaintance of Rivera’s and was with him at the Weiner Palace on the night of the murder. Rivera contended that an “inherent” conflict of interest resulted from Smith’s and Verdecchia’s representation of Vasquez during a key period of their representation of Rivera.', 'Rivera’s postconviction counsel elicited testimony from both Smith and Verdecchia about this purported conflict of interest.', 'Smith testified that he and Verdecchia jointly represented Rivera in connection with the charges that stemmed from Wilson’s murder. 3 Although Smith did not open a file on Rivera until January 7, 1998, he stated that he and Verdecchia represented Rivera as of December 1997, when Rivera was presented in the Superior Court as a violator of a previously imposed probation.', 'Smith explained that in late 1997 he and Verdecchia also represented Vasquez in connection with federal narcotics charges that were unrelated to Wilson’s murder. Smith’s representation of Vasquez on these charges concluded when Vasquez entered a plea in federal court on June 19, 1998. Smith confirmed on cross-examination that Rivera’s murder charge and Vasquez’s narcotics charges were “entirely separate and distinct” and that those two cases had “absolutely nothing to do with [each] other.” 3', 'Although Smith and Verdecchia were not formally associated in the practice of law, both of them testified that they worked together on cases from time to time.', '-4-', 'Smith testified that shortly after the murder occurred Verdecchia brought Vasquez to the Woonsocket police station to give a statement in connection with the investigation. Vasquez’s statement was admitted as a full exhibit at the postconviction-relief hearing. In that statement, Vasquez told the police (1) that he was in the restroom at the Weiner Palace and that he came out when he heard shots; (2) that he did not see Rivera fight with Wilson; and (3) that he did not see Rivera shoot Wilson. Vasquez told the police that, before going to the station to give his statement, he had spoken with Rivera by telephone. When an officer asked Vasquez whether Rivera had told him “what he [Rivera] allegedly did,” Vasquez replied that Rivera had not done so. In addition, Vasquez told the police that when he advised Rivera of his intent to give a statement, Rivera told him: “That’s your decision.”', 'Smith testified that although he “would like to think” that he discussed with Rivera the issue of a possible conflict concerning the concurrent representation of Vasquez, he was “not prepared to say under oath” that he had such a conversation. Smith did recall that he and Verdecchia had Rivera “sign something related to a potential conflict of interest.” Smith was “certain” that he had not brought this issue to the court’s attention before trial. Smith averred, however, that Rivera’s family—and perhaps Rivera himself—knew that Vasquez would be giving a statement and that Verdecchia would be present.', 'Verdecchia testified that he, too, was representing Vasquez when Vasquez spoke with police after the murder. 4 Verdecchia did not specify exactly what his representation of Vasquez on November 23, 1997, entailed; he testified only that Vasquez had contacted him and had come 4', 'Although the record is somewhat unclear on this subject, Verdecchia testified that he had previously represented Vasquez when he pled nolo contendere to a charge of simple assault in October 1997. Vasquez was later presented as a violator in December 1997, and several new charges were also filed against him. The new charges, which included narcotics offenses, were ultimately prosecuted in federal court. As noted above, Smith represented Vasquez on those charges, which were resolved through a plea agreement in June 1998.', '-5- to his office.', 'Verdecchia explained that he felt Rivera’s defense would be bolstered by Vasquez’s statement to the police. During cross-examination, he elaborated on this subject:', '“ * * * [T]he main purpose for bringing Mr. Vasquez to the police', 'station to give a statement was not because the Woonsocket Police', 'considered him a viable suspect. My impression, then, as it is now,', 'is that the Woonsocket Police considered him to be a percipient', 'witness because he was at the site, at the scene on the night in', 'question. Now, after speaking with Mr. Vasquez about the events', 'on that night, we decided—and this was a collective agreement—', 'that we would bring [Vasquez] up to the Woonsocket Police', 'station * * * in order to give testimony, which we felt was actually', 'beneficial to Mr. Rivera.”', 'Verdecchia did not recall having Rivera execute a written waiver of any conflict that might exist in connection with his and Smith’s representation of Vasquez.', 'Like Smith, Verdecchia did not disclose to the trial court any potential conflict that might have stemmed from his representation of Rivera and Vasquez because “[he] never felt there was a conflict.” When asked on cross-examination whether he “in any way [felt] any allegiance to Mr. Vasquez that prevented [him] from effectively representing [Rivera],” Verdecchia stated: “Absolutely not.”', 'ii', 'Testimony Concerning Strategic Decisions', 'Rivera also sought to prove that his attorneys had erred in making two major strategic decisions: abandoning a motion to suppress evidence of photo arrays, and deciding not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. Smith and Verdecchia explained their reasoning underlying both these decisions. As for their decision not to pursue a motion to suppress evidence, Smith and Verdecchia both testified that they felt the motion would be futile for two reasons. First, they agreed that there was nothing inherently suggestive about the photo arrays that would provide grounds for a motion to suppress. Second, they believed it would be better to highlight', '-6- some irregularities with the photo arrays through cross-examination at trial rather than “tip[', '] [their] hand” at a suppression hearing. Verdecchia elaborated on this decision as follows:', '“ * * * [W]e initially filed the motion to suppress out of an', 'abundance of caution and, at the time we filed it, thought that,', 'perhaps, there might be a ground to suppress the identification.', 'But, after doing more detailed review, we felt that [the] motion', 'would in all likelihood fail, because although there were some', 'irregularities in the methodology that was employed by the', 'Woonsocket Police Department, * * *, we felt that would go to the', 'weight as opposed to the admissibility of the * * * photo pack[s] *', '* *.', '“ * * * Had we pursued what ultimately would have been', 'an unsuccessful suppression motion, we essentially would have', 'tipped our hand, not only to * * * the prosecutor, but, more', 'importantly, to the police officers who would be testifying, not', 'only at the suppression hearing, but then at the trial.”', 'As for their decision not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense, both attorneys testified that this defense was not supported by either the discovery or their own investigation of the case. Smith and Verdecchia both noted that Rivera was the only person who had been identified as the shooter, and both attorneys testified that Rivera did not suggest to them that another person had been the shooter.', 'On cross-examination, Verdecchia confirmed that “[Rivera’s] case was reviewed in intimate detail, and also in consultation with [Rivera], and, based on those two factors, we decided to proceed with what we thought was the most effective defense * * *.” In response to an inquiry from the hearing justice, Verdecchia testified that he and Smith had discussed strategic decisions with Rivera and that Rivera “was inclined to agree [with those decisions] after [they were] explained to him.”', 'Withee also provided testimony relating to Rivera’s claim that his attorneys should have pursued a third-party perpetrator defense. He testified that he and Vasquez were both at the Weiner Palace on the night Wilson was murdered. Withee either saw or heard the altercation', '-7- that led to Wilson’s death. 5 He then “decided to get out of the area * * *.” As he left, he heard gunshots; Withee then ran away from the scene. He testified that Vasquez was by his side at this point and that there was no way that Vasquez could have fired the bullet that killed Wilson.', 'iii', 'The Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'After both parties had rested, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision in which he denied Rivera’s application for postconviction relief. The hearing justice addressed and, in turn, rejected each of Rivera’s arguments underlying his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. As for Rivera’s contention that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to pursue a motion to suppress, the hearing justice noted that there was “nothing suggestive” about the photo arrays that were introduced into evidence at trial. Crediting Smith’s and Verdecchia’s testimony, the hearing justice concluded that trial counsel had made a prudent tactical decision not to pursue the motion to suppress. He noted that Rivera’s attorneys were “rather successful[ ]” in exposing irregularities with the photo arrays at trial and that the Woonsocket police probably were “somewhat embarrassed” as a result.', 'As to Rivera’s assertion that his attorneys were ineffective in failing to pursue a third- party perpetrator defense, the hearing justice stated that Smith and Verdecchia “rightly decided that it was not a viable theory of defense.” The hearing justice noted that it was Rivera, not Vasquez, who had a physical altercation with Wilson. He also found that no one ever identified Vasquez as the person who shot the victim and that Rivera was the only person who was so identified.', 'Under these facts, the hearing justice characterized Smith’s and Verdecchia’s decision concerning a third-party perpetrator defense as “sound.” 5', 'Withee provided conflicting testimony as to whether he saw or merely heard the altercation.', '-8-', 'Finally, as to Rivera’s argument that his attorneys were ineffective because they were conflicted in their representation of him, the hearing justice found that Rivera’s attorneys neither struggled to serve two clients nor actively represented conflicting interests. Concluding his remarks from the bench, the hearing justice observed that Rivera’s conviction was not the result of his attorneys’ performance, but rather of the weight of the credible evidence against him. The hearing justice accordingly denied Rivera’s application for postconviction relief, and an order to that effect was entered on February 18, 2011. Thereafter, Rivera timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Rivera contends that the hearing justice erred in rejecting his argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.', 'Reiterating the arguments his counsel advanced at the postconviction-relief hearing, Rivera argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorneys had (1) represented him while laboring under a conflict of interest; (2) failed to pursue a motion to suppress; and (3) failed to mount a third-party perpetrator defense.', 'In his verified complaint supporting his application, Rivera set forth several additional grounds of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Only the three grounds noted above have been properly preserved for our review, and we deem the following grounds of appeal to be waived: (1) the adequacy of his attorneys’ pretrial investigation and preparation; (2) their failure to move for a speedy trial; and (3) their failure to preserve certain issues for appeal. 6 See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) 6', 'At the postconviction-relief hearing, Rivera adduced testimony relevant to the adequacy of his attorneys’ pretrial investigation and preparation. He did not, however, raise this issue during closing arguments at the hearing, and he did not object when the hearing justice did not discuss this issue when he rendered his bench decision. Accordingly, we deem that issue to be waived.', '-9- (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”).', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Rhode Island’s statutory postconviction remedy is set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10.

It is significant that Vasquez, in his statement to the police, indicated that he did not see Rivera shoot Wilson. This suggests that Vasquez was an ally of Rivera’s rather than a potential source of conflict.', 'Our precedent requires us to presume that Smith and Verdecchia were capable of correctly analyzing whether a conflict might result from their representation of both Rivera and', '- 12 - Vasquez.

Affording the hearing justice’s findings deference, as we must, we cannot say that he erred in concluding that Rivera had not carried his burden of proof in this regard.', 'B', 'Tactical Decisions', 'Rivera also contends that his attorneys were ineffective in failing to pursue a motion to suppress evidence and in failing to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. Both of these alleged grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel center on tactical decisions made by Smith and Verdecchia. “[I]t is well established that tactical decisions by trial counsel, even if ill- advised, do not by themselves constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.” Rice, 38 A.3d at 18 (quoting Vorgvongsa v.

First, concerning the motion to suppress, we discern no error in the hearing justice’s finding that there was “nothing suggestive” about the photo arrays. Furthermore, the hearing justice credited the testimony of Smith and Verdecchia, who explained that they had made a strategic choice to expose irregularities with the photo arrays as they were presented at trial rather than at a suppression hearing. The hearing justice found that “the first prong of Strickland clearly [was] not violated, and there [had] been an utter failure to carry the burden of proof with regard to that claim.” We agree, and therefore hold that Rivera’s attorneys', '- 13 - did not render ineffective assistance of counsel in choosing not to pursue a motion to suppress evidence.', 'Similarly, we must defer to the hearing justice’s findings of historical fact regarding trial counsels’ decision not to mount a third-party perpetrator defense. In the context of an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, the issue is not whether the trial justice properly admitted or excluded evidence supporting a third-party perpetrator defense, but whether trial counsel should have pursued such a defense. 7 Although this Court has previously considered on direct appeal whether a trial justice properly excluded evidence relating to a third-party perpetrator defense, we have never before considered on collateral review whether an attorney’s failure to mount a third-party perpetrator defense deprived a defendant of his or her right to the effective assistance of counsel.', 'We are guided in our resolution of this issue by Bryant v. Commissioner of Correction, 964 A.2d 1186 (Conn. 2009).

99,State : v. : Eileen Morrice.,criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Eileen Morrice, appeals from the denial of her motion to seal records pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19-19(c) and G.L. 1956 § 12-1- 12. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial justice erred: (1) in finding that the plain and ordinary meaning of the statute did not entitle the defendant to relief; by refusing to apply § 12- 19-19(c) retroactively; (2) in finding that the amended provision violates the separation-of- powers doctrine; and (3) in declining to sever the “shall be exonerated” portion of the statute from the “shall be sealed” provision. In a companion case decided by this Court today, we held that the amendments to § 12-19-19 enacted by the General Assembly in 2010 (P.L. 2010, ch. 128, § 1 and ch. 256, § 1) do not have retroactive application. See State v. Briggs, No. 2011-47- C.A. (R.I., filed Jan. 11, 2013) (Briggs II). For similar reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The record seemingly indicates that Ms. Morrice is a quintessential candidate for a deferred sentence and the subsequent sealing of records. In the spring of 2003, she was charged', '-1- with one count of obtaining money under false pretenses over $500. The complaint alleged that she obtained $7,837 by submitting unemployment insurance certification forms containing false information. 1 She accepted responsibility for the crime by entering a plea of nolo contendere to the single count on April 14, 2003 and by agreeing to pay restitution in installments of $130 per month. In light of her plea, her sentencing was deferred for a period of five years. In addition, there is no dispute that defendant faithfully complied with all the terms and conditions of her deferred sentence or that she paid off her restitution seven months early. However, her hope for the immediate expungement or sealing of her records, or both, was frustrated when this Court clarified the law in 2007.', 'In State v. Briggs, 934 A.2d 811, 815-16 (R.I. 2007) (Briggs I), this Court held that the Superior Court does not have inherent authority to grant expungement upon the completion of a deferred sentence; rather, a defendant must satisfy the requirements for statutory expungement under G.L. 1956 § 12-1.3-2. 2 The Court further held that, for purposes of expungement, nolo contendere pleas followed by deferred sentences constitute convictions. Briggs I, 934 A.2d at 816. Under § 12-1.3-2(b), a first offender may file a motion for expungement five years after the completion of his or her sentence (if a misdemeanor) or ten years after the completion of sentence (if a felony). 1', 'In a decision issued on November 12, 2010, the hearing justice stated that “[d]efendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to one count of conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act and two counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud.” This would appear to be an error. The criminal complaint refers only to the charge of obtaining money under false pretenses, and nothing in the record indicates any other charge. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-1.3-2(a) states:', '“Any person who is a first offender may file a motion for the', 'expungement of all records and records of conviction for a felony', 'or misdemeanor by filing a motion in the court in which the', 'conviction took place, provided that no person who has been', 'convicted of a crime of violence shall have his or her records and', 'records of conviction expunged.”', '-2-', 'In 2010, the General Assembly amended § 12-19-19 3 (the deferred-sentence statute) to include, inter alia, a new subsection (c), which states:', '“If a person, after the completion of the five (5) year', 'deferment period is determined by the court to have complied with', 'all of the terms and conditions of the written deferral agreement,', 'then the person shall be exonerated of the charges for which', 'sentence was deferred and records relating to the criminal', 'complaint, information or indictment shall be sealed pursuant to', 'the provision of § 12-1-12. Further, if any record of the criminal', 'complaint, information or indictment has been entered into a', 'docket or alphabetical index, whether in writing or electronic', 'information storage or other data compilation system, all', 'references to the identity of the person charged by the complaint', 'shall be sealed.” Section 12-19-19, as amended by P.L. 2010, ch.', '128, § 1 and ch. 256, § 1.

The defendant maintained that if the court found that retroactivity was an issue, as a remedial statute § 12-19-19 was entitled to retroactive application, and further, that to hold otherwise would lead to an absurd result. Finally, defendant argued that because of her lack of criminal history and her rehabilitation through the successful completion of her deferment, she was entitled to have her records sealed and that equity required no less. The state argued that the amended statute should not be applied retroactively without clear language indicating such a legislative intent, and that, if applied retroactively, the statute would “constitute an impermissible exercise of judicial power by the Legislature” and thereby would violate the separation-of-powers doctrine.', 'The defendant’s motion was heard on November 5, 2010, along with similar motions filed by a number of persons who also had successfully completed deferred sentences. The hearing justice issued a written “main decision” in one case (State v. Warzycha, 2010 WL 4682605 (R.I. Super. Nov. 12, 2010)), which was incorporated by reference in the decisions in the remaining individual cases. The court denied all of the motions, finding that § 12-19-19 “does not include any clear, strong language indicating an intent that it is to be applied retroactively nor does it apply retroactively by necessary implication.” The hearing justice also 4', 'Although defendant’s brief states clearly that she neither moved for, nor is she seeking, the remedy of exoneration, at oral argument, defendant stated that she was seeking both exoneration and sealing. Because defendant admits that she did not move for exoneration, we deem that argument waived.', '-4- concluded that the statute created a substantive right, and that its retroactive application would violate the doctrine of separation of powers.

Lastly, “under no circumstances will this Court ‘construe a statute to reach an absurd result.’” Id. (quoting Generation Realty, LLC, 21 A.3d at 259).', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant raises three issues. First, defendant argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that the plain and ordinary meaning of the amended statute did not entitle defendant to benefit from it. Further, defendant contends that the hearing justice erred in ruling that the 2010 amendments should not be applied retroactively. Finally, defendant asserts that the hearing justice erred in failing to sever the “exoneration” remedy from the “sealing” remedy, thereby avoiding any separation-of-powers issue.', 'In reply, the state argues that the hearing justice was correct in finding that the amendments should not be applied retroactively because of the absence of clear language or any necessary implication requiring retroactivity, and because the amendments create new substantive rights. Further, the state argues that retroactive application of the 2010 amendments would violate the separation-of-powers doctrine, and that the exoneration remedy is not severable from the sealing remedy as the statute now is written.', 'A', 'Retroactivity', '1', 'Plain and Ordinary Meaning', 'The defendant argues that the language of § 12-19-19 is “crystal clear and entirely unambiguous” and that it requires the court to seal the records of those defendants who, like Ms. Morrice, have completed their deferred sentence period, regardless of when that deferred sentence agreement was executed. She further argues that the 2010 amendments did not change the conditions of deferred sentences; rather, they merely require the Superior Court to seal the', '-6- records of a person once it has determined that the person has successfully completed his or her deferred sentence.', 'Thus, she contends, the plain and ordinary meaning of § 12-19-19(c) commands the Superior Court to consider her compliance with the terms of her deferred sentence and, if it finds that she did comply, then to seal her records.', 'This Court consistently has held that “‘statutes and their amendments are applied prospectively,’ absent ‘clear, strong language, or by necessary implication that the Legislature intended a statute to have retroactive application * * *.’” Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 318 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Ducally v. State, 809 A.2d 472, 474 (R.I. 2002)).', 'Based upon our de novo review of § 12-19-19, as amended in 2010, we find no “clear, strong language” directing that the remedies of exoneration and sealing be applied to deferred sentences entered into prior to the effective date of the amendments.', 'Arguably, the 2010 amendments to § 12-19-19 did not radically alter the then-existing practice concerning the deferment of sentences. Nevertheless, the amendments create a more formalized process.', 'The General Assembly added two new subsections to § 12-19-19. Subsection (b) of § 12-19-19 expressly conditions any deferment of sentence upon the defendant’s agreement to keep the peace and be of good behavior and clarifies that the court may impose sentence upon the defendant’s violation of any of the terms and conditions of the deferment, such violation to be determined “in accordance with procedures relating to violation of probation §§ 12-19-2 and 12-19-14.”', 'Section 12-19-19(c) provides for the exoneration of the charges and the sealing of the records upon successful compliance with all the terms and conditions of the “written deferral agreement.”', 'We note that the 2010 amendments revised the term “written agreement” to “written deferral agreement.” Although this change seemingly is minor and technical in nature,', '-7- the fact that the remedies of exoneration and sealing are specifically contingent upon compliance with the “written deferral agreement” suggests that such remedies apply only to deferred sentences imposed after the date of amendment. We reject, therefore, defendant’s contention that the plain language of the amended statute compels the sealing of her records—and presumably the records of all others who have complied with the terms and conditions of agreements entered into before the 2010 amendments were enacted.', 'Nor do we discern a need for retrospective application of § 12-19-19(c) by necessary implication. On the contrary, the only temporal mandate given by the General Assembly is § 2 of the enacting legislation, which states, “[t]his act shall take effect upon passage.” As this Court has previously held, such language, “[i]n the absence of any express language or implicit indication that the statutory amendment should be applied retroactively,” indicates an intent toward prospective application only. In re Alicia S., 763 A.2d at 647. See also Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 318 (stating that the Court had previously held that a statute did not apply retroactively when the statute provided that it did not take effect until its date of passage). We are satisfied, therefore, that the plain language of § 12-19-19 as amended in 2010 does not necessarily imply that the General Assembly intended for subsection (c) to apply retroactively.', '2', 'Legislative Intent', 'The defendant argues alternatively that the 2010 amendments evince a legislative intent that they be applied retroactively. To support this argument, defendant first contends that the amendments to § 12-19-19 were enacted in direct response to our holding in Briggs I that the expungement statute was the only available recourse for the expungement of records after the successful completion of a deferred sentence. According to defendant, the amendments were', '-8- enacted “to provide an additional avenue of recourse by granting the Superior Court the authority and jurisdiction to seal deferred sentences under * * * § 12-19-19.” She also posits that the General Assembly was reacting to a letter from the then-Attorney General Patrick Lynch supporting the proposed amendments. In that letter, Attorney General Lynch wrote that “a deferred sentence is a contractual agreement that the [s]tate and the defendant enter into voluntarily and knowingly.” From this assertion, defendant draws the conclusion that “the intent of the legislature was to provide [her] with the benefit of the Attorney General’s promise in order to wipe her record clean.”', 'Not surprisingly, the state reads the Attorney General’s letter in an entirely different light, interpreting his endorsement of the proposed amendments as a way to make “deferred sentences a more ‘palatable’ sentencing option going forward.” Although it is quite possible that Attorney General Lynch’s support of the subject legislation may well have been helpful to its passage, we decline to place any significance on his letter as an indicator of legislative intent. See State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005) (“The plain statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent.”).', 'The defendant next contends that § 12-19-19 applies retroactively because it is ameliorative and remedial in nature. This assertion requires us to examine whether the statute is substantive in nature, or remedial or procedural. See Direct Action for Rights and Equality v.

We agree. Prior to the 2010 amendments, expungement was not available to individuals who had committed a crime of violence or who were repeat offenders. See § 12-1.3-2. Moreover, § 12-19-19(c) purports to exonerate 5 any person who successfully complies with the terms and conditions of a written deferral agreement “of the charges for which sentence was deferred.”', 'Before such amendment was enacted, however, an individual who had been granted an expungement under § 12-1.3-2 nevertheless was required to disclose the conviction in application “for a law enforcement agency position, for admission to the bar of any court * * * for a teaching certificate, * * * or [to be] the operator or employee of an early childhood education facility * * *.” Section 12-1.3-4(b). Section 12-19- 19(c), by contrast, contains no such limitation about disclosure and seemingly would make exoneration and sealing available to those who are not first-time offenders, as well as to those who have committed a crime of violence. We conclude, therefore, that although the deferred- sentence statute is remedial in nature, see Briggs I, 934 A.2d at 816-17, the addition of subsection (c) to § 12-19-19 was a substantive amendment and not entitled to retroactive application.', '3', 'Absurd Result', 'Finally, defendant argues that the statute should be interpreted to apply retroactively because an alternate construction would produce an absurd result.

The defendant also points to the apparent pre- Briggs I practice of granting immediate expungement to some individuals upon completion of their deferred sentences as further proof that to deny her request to seal would be illogical. Although the state does not disagree that some individuals were in fact granted expungement pre-Briggs I, it correctly points out that given this Court’s decision in Briggs I, those individuals might not have been entitled to that relief.', 'The defendant asserts that if relief is not granted to her under § 12-19-19(c), she will not receive the benefit of the bargain she made when she entered into the deferred-sentence agreement and that she would have “no ability to receive the relief” promised. We reject this argument for two reasons. First, an amendment drafted in 2010 could not serve as the basis of a bargain entered into in 2003, and the relief offered by § 12-19-19(c) is a different remedy (exoneration and sealing) from that available in 2003. Second, defendant may still receive the relief allegedly promised, albeit in 2018 rather than 2012. Accordingly, we do not find that declining to apply § 12-19-19(c) retroactively would reach an absurd result.', 'B', 'Separation of Powers', 'Having determined that the statute may not be applied retroactively, this Court need not reach the question of whether retroactive application would violate the doctrine of separation of', '- 11 - powers. In State v. Warzycha, 2010 WL 4682605, incorporated by reference in the lower court’s decision in this case, the hearing justice stated, and we agree, that it is unnecessary at this time to determine whether prospective application would be unconstitutional. Because no defendant who entered a deferred-sentence agreement subsequent to the enactment of § 12-19-19(c) will yet have completed his or her five-year deferment, this issue is not yet ripe for review. For these reasons, we will not reach the question of whether the exoneration clause of § 12-19-19(c) is, as the defendant urges, severable from the sealing clause.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

In these consolidated appeals, the defendants, James Briggs and Anna M. Matthias, 1 challenge the denial of their motions to seal records pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19-19(c) and G.L. 1956 § 12-1-12. Specifically, the defendants assert that the trial justice erred: by refusing to apply § 12-19-19(c) retroactively; in finding that said provision violates the separation-of-powers doctrine; and in declining to sever the “shall be exonerated” portion of the statute from the “shall be sealed” provision. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In 2007, defendants first came before this Court on appeal from the denial of their motions for expungement.

Briggs, 934 A.2d 811 (R.I. 2007) (hereinafter Briggs I). 1', 'Ms. Matthias’s name has been spelled “Mathias” in the caption and numerous court documents, but it would appear from Ms. Matthias’s pleadings that “Matthias” is the correct spelling. As such, we will use “Matthias” in this opinion.', '-1- James Briggs had pled nolo contendere to one count of second-degree robbery; and, on January 20, 1995, he received a five-year deferred sentence. Id. at 813. On September 3, 2003, after completing his deferred sentence, Briggs moved to expunge all records involving his arrest and plea. Id. Anna Matthias had pled nolo contendere to one count of possession of a controlled substance; and, on March 4, 1996, she received a five-year deferred sentence. Id. On September 18, 2003, after completing her deferred sentence, Matthias also moved to expunge the records of her arrest and plea. Id. On May 4, 2004, both motions were denied. Id. at 814. The hearing justice found that the deferred sentences were not automatically expunged, but rather that they were subject to the expungement statutes, G.L. 1956 §§ 12-1.3-2 and 12-1.3-3. 2 Briggs I, 934 A.2d at 814. Because Briggs had committed a crime of violence, and Matthias had pled nolo contendere to charges of simple assault within the previous ten years, neither defendant met the criteria for expungement under those statutes. Id. On appeal to this Court, both defendants contended that the hearing justice erred by relying on the expungement statutes, arguing that, instead, the Superior Court should have exercised its “inherent authority” to expunge. Id. In Briggs I, this Court affirmed the Superior Court’s ruling and held that, for purposes of the expungement statutes, nolo contendere pleas followed by deferred sentences constitute convictions which may be expunged only by satisfying the statutory criteria. Id. at 816. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-1.3-2(a) reads, in relevant part, “[a]ny person who is a first offender may file a motion for the expungement of all records and records of conviction for a felony or misdemeanor * * * provided that no person who has been convicted of a crime of violence shall have his or her records * * * expunged.” In the case of a misdemeanor conviction, a person may file a motion for expungement “after five (5) years from the date of the completion of his or her sentence.” Section 12-1.3-2(b). A person with a felony conviction may move to expunge “after ten (10) years from the date of the completion of his or her sentence.” Section 12-1.3-2(c). Section 12-1.3-3(b)(1) provides that the court has discretion to grant expungement provided that “in the five (5) years preceding the filing of the motion, if the conviction was for a misdemeanor, or in the ten (10) years preceding the filing of the motion if the conviction was for a felony, the petitioner has not been convicted nor arrested for any felony or misdemeanor * * *.”', '-2-', 'In 2010, the General Assembly passed an act amending § 12-19-19 3 (the deferred- sentence statute), which, inter alia, added two new subsections, (b) and (c).

P.L. 2009, ch. 68, art. 11, § 1(c).', 'In August 2010, Briggs and Matthias, as well as a number of others who similarly had completed deferred sentences, filed motions to seal under § 12-19-19(c). It is important to note that defendants requested only that their records be sealed; they did not seek exoneration. Although the then-Attorney General had submitted a letter to the General Assembly supporting passage of the amendments to “bring more flexibility to the deferred sentencing agreement,” the state objected to these motions. The hearing justice accepted briefs from the several movants and the state, and heard arguments on November 5, 2010.', 'To support their motions, defendants argued that they were the “intended recipients of this remedial legislation” and under the language of the amended statute were eligible to have their records sealed; thus there was no issue of retroactivity. The defendants maintained that if the court found that retroactivity was an issue, the 2010 amendments were remedial in nature and appropriate for retroactive application. Finally, defendants argued that the amended statute did not offend the doctrine of separation of powers. The state maintained that the amended statute could not be applied retroactively without clear language indicating an intent to do so, and that, if applied retroactively, the statute would “constitute an impermissible exercise of judicial power by the Legislature” and thus violate the separation-of-powers doctrine.', 'On November 12, 2010, the hearing justice issued a written “main decision” in one case, State v. Warzycha, 2010 WL 4682605 (R.I. Super. Nov. 12, 2010), which was incorporated by reference in the decisions in the remaining individual cases. The court denied all of the motions, finding that § 12-19-19 “does not include any clear, strong language indicating an intent that it is', '-4- to be applied retroactively nor does it apply retroactively by necessary implication.” The hearing justice further found that the statute created a substantive right and that its retroactive application would violate the doctrine of separation of powers.

In undertaking this responsibility, we are mindful that “[i]t is generally presumed that the General Assembly ‘intended every word of a statute to have a useful purpose and to have some force and effect.’” Curtis v.

This Court repeatedly has held that “statutes will be given prospective application unless otherwise provided.” In re Alicia S., 763 A.2d 643, 646 (R.I. 2000). Importantly, “[o]nly when the Legislature, by express language or necessary implication, manifests its intent that a statute be given retroactive effect, will the courts apply it retrospectively[.]” Id. at 646-47.

First, defendants argue that the hearing justice erred in ruling that the statute should not be applied retroactively. Next, defendants assert that the hearing justice erred in failing to sever the “exoneration” remedy from the “sealing” remedy, thereby avoiding any separation-of-powers issue. Finally, defendants maintain that the hearing justice erred when she “relied upon a sentence in a footnote in Briggs I” to find that exoneration was a prerequisite to the sealing remedy.', 'In reply, the state argues that the hearing justice was correct in finding that § 12-19-19 should not be applied retroactively because of the absence of clear language or any necessary implication requiring retroactivity, and because the statute creates new substantive rights. Further, the state argues that retroactive application of the statute would violate separation of powers and that exoneration is not severable from sealing as the statute is now written. Finally, the state argues that the hearing justice was correct in holding that the General Assembly cannot require sealing under § 12-19-19(c) without first amending § 12-1-12. 4 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-1-12 provides as follows:', '“(a) Any fingerprint, photograph, physical measurements, or other', 'record of identification, heretofore or hereafter taken by or under', 'the direction of the attorney general, the superintendent of state', 'police, the member or members of the police department of any', 'city or town or any other officer authorized by this chapter to take', 'them, of a person under arrest, prior to the final conviction of the', 'person for the offense then charged, shall be destroyed by all', 'offices or departments having the custody or possession within', 'sixty (60) days after there has been an acquittal, dismissal, no true', 'bill, no information, or the person has been otherwise exonerated', 'from the offense with which he or she is charged, and the clerk of', 'court where the exoneration has taken place shall, consistent with', '§ 12-1-12.1, place under seal all records of the person in the case', 'including all records of the division of criminal identification', '-6-', 'A', 'Retroactivity', '1', 'Necessary Implication', 'The defendants argue that the language of § 12-19-19, taken as a whole, implies that the General Assembly intended the sealing provision to apply to those who successfully complete a deferred sentence agreement, regardless of when that agreement was entered.', 'This Court consistently has held that “‘statutes and their amendments are applied prospectively,’ absent ‘clear, strong language, or by necessary implication that the Legislature intended a statute to have retroactive application * * *.’” Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 318 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Ducally v. State, 809 A.2d 472, 474 (R.I. 2002)). The defendants concede that the statute “does not contain an explicit legislative direction that it was intended to apply retroactively to deferred sentence agreements entered prior to the amendment’s effective date,” but they maintain that, read as a whole, § 12-19-19(c) is intended to have retroactive effect. In the absence of “clear, strong language,” defendants point to the use of the words “whenever” and “any” within', 'established by § 12-1-4; provided, that the person shall not have', 'been previously convicted of any felony offense.

The state dismisses any importance placed on the words “whenever” and “any,” noting that the use of those terms predates the 2010 amendments by more than eighty years. See P.L. 1927, ch. 1063, § 1.', 'Our de novo review of § 12-19-19 reveals no language that would direct or necessarily imply that the General Assembly intended the 2010 amendments to have retroactive effect. On the contrary, this Court previously has held that an act amending a statute stating “[t]his act shall take effect upon passage * * * [i]n the absence of any express language or implicit indication that the statutory amendment should be applied retroactively” indicates an intent toward prospective application only. In re Alicia S., 763 A.2d at 647. See also Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 318 (stating that the Court had previously held that a statute did not apply retroactively when the statute provided that it did not take effect until its date of passage). We are satisfied, therefore, that the plain language of § 12-19-19 as amended in 2010, taken as a whole, does not demonstrate a legislative intent by necessary implication that § 12-19-19(c) is applicable to deferred sentences entered into before the effective date of the 2010 amendments.', '2', 'Substantive or Remedial', 'Having found neither clear, strong language, nor any necessary implication that the General Assembly intended retroactive application, this Court next examines whether the statute is substantive in nature, or remedial or procedural.

Moreover, § 12-19-19(c) purports to exonerate any person who successfully complies with the terms and conditions of a written deferral agreement “of the charges for which sentence was deferred.” Under the expungement regime, a person whose conviction of a crime had been expunged was not required to disclose his or her conviction except in certain enumerated circumstances—for example, the fact of an expunged conviction must be disclosed in applications “for a law enforcement agency position, for admission to the bar of any court, * * * for a teaching certificate, * * * or [to be] the operator or employee of an early childhood education facility * * *.” Section 12-1.3-4(a)-(b). Section 12-19-19(c) contains no such limitation as to disclosure and would seemingly make exoneration available to those who are not first-time offenders, as well as those who have committed a crime of violence. We conclude, therefore, that although as a whole, the deferred-sentence statute is remedial in nature, see Briggs I, 934 A.2d at 816-17, the addition of subsection (c) to § 12-19-19 in 2010 was a substantive amendment and thus not entitled to retroactive application.', '-9-', 'Alternatively, defendants argue that there is a presumption in favor of retroactivity when a penal law is changed for the benefit of those subject to it.

Pereira, 973 A.2d 19, 33 (R.I. 2009).

101,,non-criminal,not affirm,"['PER CURIAM. The applicant, Floyd Edmond Webb, III, petitioned this Court for a hearing concerning the recommendation of the Supreme Court’s Committee on Character and Fitness (committee) that he be denied admission to the Rhode Island bar. Specifically, the applicant asserts that the committee abused its discretion by neither admitting him to the bar outright, nor recommending conditional admission under Article II, Rule 3(l)(2) of the Supreme Court Rules of Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law. This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the applicant to show cause why the recommendation of the committee should not be adopted. After considering the applicant’s written and oral submissions, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we adopt the recommendation of the committee.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The applicant graduated from Roger Williams University School of Law in May 2008 and applied to take the bar examination that July. At that time, applicant was interviewed by a single committee member and advised that, if he passed the examination, he would be required to appear before the full committee “due to issues of candor in both the [a]pplication and his law', '-1- school application * * *.” In particular, because applicant admitted in his initial interview that he did not fully disclose all prior arrests and charges, nor fully identify the disposition of those arrests and charges, he was advised to supplement his application to include such disclosure. In July 2009, applicant passed the bar examination on his third attempt. The applicant then appeared before the committee on October 25, 2009, December 21, 2009, February 3, 2010, April 26, 2010, and finally, on June 1, 2010.', 'Despite being advised to supplement his application “to address the issues raised during the initial interview,” the committee found that the amendment, which applicant filed immediately prior to the October 25 hearing, failed to address those issues. During the hearing, applicant was advised that the committee would send a written request for the additional information. The committee received additional information from applicant and scheduled a second hearing for December 21, 2009. The information provided encompassed thirteen items, including “prior arrests, traffic issues, police incident reports, and civil litigation.”', 'In addition to two arrests in 1983 and 1998, as well as several traffic violations and incident reports, the committee focused on two confrontations applicant had with the Providence police and one confrontation with the Rhode Island state police. On November 14, 1999, applicant was charged with disorderly conduct after arguing with a Providence police officer who was controlling traffic during a road race. The applicant admitted calling the officer “a f***ing idiot.” The charge, which applicant mischaracterized as “disturbing the peace,” was dismissed and subsequently expunged. On June 3, 2006, while attending law school, applicant was arrested and charged with vandalism, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest. The charges stemmed from an incident in which applicant allegedly had tied his dogs to the door handle of a bank, and when Providence police officers removed the dogs, telling applicant that he was', '-2- obstructing the entrance of the bank, applicant “had a few choice words” for the officers and the situation rapidly deteriorated. The applicant pled nolo contendere to resisting arrest, and the other charges were dismissed.', 'That conviction later was expunged and sealed.', 'In his application, applicant stated that he had been arrested for “disturbing [the] peace” and that the charge had been dismissed; he failed to disclose that he had pled nolo contendere to resisting arrest.', 'An incident involving the state police occurred on May 24, 2004. The applicant was stopped for speeding, and the incident was recorded by the state trooper’s “MVR tape.” Impatient with the amount of time it was taking for the trooper to return with his ticket, applicant called 9-1-1 to complain. The trooper on the scene described applicant as being “aggressive,” becoming belligerent, and calling the troopers “losers.”', 'During the December hearing, applicant disputed the accuracy of the police reports and accused the police officers of lying. The committee was unable to complete its review, and scheduled another hearing for February 3, 2009. The committee asked applicant to submit a copy of the police report about an incident on June 3, 2006. When applicant provided the requested incident report, the committee found that it contradicted his prior testimony. The applicant alleged that the report was “a complete misstatement of the facts” by the police.', 'The committee scheduled hearings on April 26, 2010, and June 1, 2010, to hear testimony from the police officers involved in certain of the incidents that applicant disclosed. In all, seven police officers testified during those hearings. The applicant was represented by counsel, who cross-examined the witnesses, all of whom testified that their reports were accurate. Two of the officers professed vivid recollections of the events in question. Providence police Det. Steven Gencarella, in recounting the incident on June 3, 2003 that resulted in a charge of resisting arrest,', '-3- stated that he “clearly remembered everything that happened” because “[v]ery rarely do we deal with people that act in a way that Mr. Webb acted that day, so they kind of stick out in your mind.” Rhode Island State Trooper Peter Cambio remembered Mr. Webb as one of his “top five [stops;] * * * [t]he worst five that I’ve encountered.”', 'At the conclusion of the hearing, applicant was questioned about the most recent police incident reports, dated May 6, 2010. The applicant was asked whether he had, in fact, used the term “loser,” and applicant denied making such a statement. When asked whether the use of the term “loser” in two separate police accounts was a coincidence, he replied, “[y]es.”', 'The applicant was advised that he could respond to the police testimony or provide a written submission, which would be due by June 30, 2010. As the meeting was ending, members of the committee said they heard applicant state, “Let’s get out of here. I’ve had enough.” Moments later, applicant denied any memory of making that statement.', 'In July, applicant’s attorney requested an enlargement of time for the filing of a post- hearing memorandum and withdrew as applicant’s counsel.', 'On July 30, 2010, applicant requested that the committee take no action on his application until he reported to the committee that he had completed counseling for anger management and conflict with authority figures. On September 6, 2010, Barbara Schweitzer, LICSW delivered a letter to the committee stating that applicant had completed counseling sessions with her and that he understood “the source of his anger, and has committed to using learned methods of containing it.” The committee directed applicant to confirm whether he would be retaining new counsel, and gave him until October 29, 2010, to file any additional information.', 'In a letter received by the bar administrator on October 13, 2010, applicant advised the committee that he had retained new counsel. The committee met with counsel on March 7,', '-4- 2011, to discuss the status of the application, and it granted his request to extend to April 18, 2011, the time to respond to the committee about the application. No information was received from either applicant or his counsel, although, in a conversation with the chair of the committee, counsel indicated that he understood that applicant would be withdrawing his application.', 'On June 28, 2011, the committee received an additional Providence Incident Report concerning an incident on July 10, 2010. On July 1, 2011, new counsel reported that he, too, had withdrawn as applicant’s attorney. After receiving a letter from the committee stating that, unless he withdrew his application by August 5, the committee would proceed with preparing its recommendation, applicant sent a letter stating that he would not be withdrawing his application and chiding his former counsel for making such a misrepresentation. In his letter, applicant alleged that the committee failed to follow the Administrative Procedures Act, that the committee’s duties were “overly broad” and “apparently allow[ed] members to be partisan,” and that the committee had no rules governing conflicts, ethics, or the admissibility of evidence. Finally, applicant accused the committee of distorting his record and using the hearing “to create a highly subjective and inaccurate reflection of [his] character and fitness.” The applicant then requested that, if necessary, the committee issue a conditional approval.', 'The committee received a letter dated October 4, 2011, from Stephen Bishop, a clinical psychologist, stating that he had “evaluated with Mr. Webb the specific altercations that have occurred between [Webb] and the police.” Although Dr. Bishop did not state whether he had treated applicant, he offered his “professional opinion that [Webb] can and will manage his anger effectively now and in the future and that he should be regarded as [a] potentially valuable member of the legal profession * * *.”', '-5-', 'On January 17, 2012, the committee submitted to this Court its “Recommendation of Denial to the Rhode Island Bar.” The committee recommended denial on the grounds that applicant', '“failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence his moral', 'character and fitness to practice law due to 1) his lack of candor in', 'fully and completely disclosing required information in the filing', 'of his application to law school and the [a]pplication seeking', 'admission to the Rhode Island bar, [and] 2) his conduct and lack of', 'candor before the Committee as confirmed by the testimony of', 'other witnesses throughout the course of the meetings with the', 'Committee.” The committee found the testimony of the police officers to be credible and applicant’s testimony not to be credible. Further, the committee found that applicant displayed a lack of candor and truthfulness both in failing to fully and accurately disclose past arrests, traffic issues, and civil litigation, and in giving “false, misleading and evasive answers” about the underlying incidents.', 'In addition, the committee found that applicant “displayed repeated issues with authority figures,” and it questioned his “ability to meet his professional responsibility and obligations as a lawyer.” Accordingly, the committee recommended that the application be denied.', 'On May 25, 2012, applicant (now pro se) filed a “[petition to show cause and request for hearing]” arguing that the committee had abused its discretion and the recommendation was not well-founded because his disclosures satisfied Rule 3, he had “[no issues with authority figures],” he did not lack candor and sincerity, and that “[admission under Roots and Rule 3(l)(2) was the correct outcome].” See In re Application of Roots, 762 A.2d 1161 (R.I. 2000). It then came to the Court’s attention that applicant had been arrested on April 2, 2012, for leaving the scene of an accident. According to the arrest report, applicant was arraigned and given a court', '-6- date of May 18, 2012. Prior to his appearance before this Court applicant had not updated his bar application to include this most recent arrest. 1', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“We will not overturn a recommendation of this Court’s Committee on Character and Fitness * * * unless it has ‘abused its discretion or its decision is clearly wrong.’” In re Roots, 762 A.2d at 1163 (quoting In re Application of Capace, 110 R.I. 254, 259, 291 A.2d 632, 634 (1972)). “We will do so, however, if ‘such recommendation is not well founded.’” Id. at 1164 (quoting In re Testa, 489 A.2d 331, 334 (R.I. 1985)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'To gain admittance to the Rhode Island bar, an applicant “shall be required to establish by clear and convincing evidence their moral character and fitness to the satisfaction of the Committee on Character and Fitness of the Supreme Court * * *.” Rule 3(a). The applicant has “the burden of proving his [or] her good moral character * * *.” Rule 3(f). “The failure of any applicant to answer any question * * * or to supply any documentary material requested by [the committee] * * *, shall justify a finding that the applicant has not met the burden of proving his [or] her good moral character.” Id.', 'The committee forwarded its recommendation to this Court, finding that applicant “willfully concealed full and accurate information” requested in his applications, gave “false, misleading and evasive answers,” “demonstrated a lack of candor and sincerity,” and displayed 1', 'The applicant appeared before this Court on November 19, 2012. During oral argument he acknowledged that he had not amended his application. On December 10, 2012, applicant filed an amendment to his application stating that he “entered a plea of nolo contendere with a one year filing.”', '-7- “repeated issues with authority figures * * *.” The applicant responds by stating that he had no willful intent to conceal information, and rather had “made a good faith interpretation” of questions that he found to be ambiguous. Further, he argues that he was never evasive or misleading. Although he admits that he “did not attempt to appease the questioner,” he states that the committee can point to no false statement nor any time that he refused to answer a question. The applicant disputes the committee’s finding that he lacked candor and sincerity, stating that such a finding is clearly wrong because the committee “ignored the good faith concerns [he] raised with the examination.” The applicant avers that he has no issues with authority figures, and states that the committee’s finding that he did have such issues was “rendered dubious” by the committee members’ relationships with police officers. Finally, applicant distinguishes his case from the facts of In re Roots, stating that because his transgressions were not as serious as those in Roots, the committee was “clearly wrong” in recommending denial of his application.', 'The committee conducted an exhaustive investigation of the issues raised in Webb’s application. It sought and received police reports and incident reports not proffered by applicant, conducted five separate hearings, and gave applicant the opportunity to cross-examine the seven police officers who testified.', 'The applicant also was given ample opportunity both to supplement his disclosures and to offer explanations for the incidents in question. Finally, as an applicant to the Rhode Island bar, Webb is charged with knowledge of his continuing duty to report any changes to the information contained in his application, including any arrests. All applicants are required to submit a signed, notarized Section D with their bar applications. Section D states:', '“I hereby acknowledge that this application is a continuing', 'application for the Rhode Island Bar and that I have an obligation', '-8-', 'to keep the responses to the questions therein current, complete', 'and correct by the filing of timely Amendment to Application', '(form provided upon request) until the date of my taking the Oath', 'of Attorney in Rhode Island.”', 'Webb’s notarized signature appears just below that acknowledgement in Section D of his bar application. Although the applicant takes issue with the committee’s findings about the credibility of the police officers who testified and the lack of credibility and candor on Webb’s part, we can perceive no evidence of an abuse of discretion on the part of the committee. Moreover, even if there were some question about the issues covered in the applicant’s petition, there is a further issue that is dispositive, namely the previously undisclosed April 2, 2012 arrest for leaving the scene of an accident. The applicant was arraigned and given a court date of May 18, 2012. The applicant filed his petition with this Court on May 25, 2012—just one week later, and did not mention the arrest in it. In fact, he represented that he had “no issues with the Providence [p]olice since [his] 2006 arrest.” It is true that this most recent arrest, in Providence, was made by the state police, but it strains credulity to believe that the applicant was not aware of the need to disclose that arrest. 2 This is a serious lapse, and it serves to underline rather than undermine the committee’s conclusion that the applicant failed to meet his burden of proving his character and fitness to practice law as a member of the bar of this Court. 2', 'In a letter accompanying his amendment, applicant said that his attorney “did not advise [him] that [he] was required to amend [his] application,” that he “found no obligation to file an amendment” in Article II, Rules 3, 8 and 12 of the Supreme Court Rules of Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law, and that he remained unaware of this obligation until he was so advised during oral argument. However, after signing Section D, applicant is charged with knowledge of the obligation.', '-9-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, the applicant’s petition for admission to the bar of this state is hereby denied.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'In re Application of Floyd Edmond Webb, III.

102,State : v. : Gerald Lynch.,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case came before the Court on writ of certiorari after the defendant, Gerald Lynch, sought review of the trial justice’s decision to deny his motion to reduce sentence. On December 5, 2012, the parties appeared before this Court for oral argument based on an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised by the defendant should not be decided summarily without further briefing or argument.', 'After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the matter should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the trial justice’s decision to deny the defendant’s motion to reduce sentence.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History 1', 'In 2004, M.G. 2 appeared at the Pawtucket Police Department and reported that he had been sexually assaulted by defendant almost twenty years earlier, when M.G. was fourteen and fifteen years old, and while he was employed at defendant’s flower shop. In April 2004, a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with nine counts of first-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2. 3 In October 2006, a jury found Lynch guilty on four counts of first-degree sexual assault. 4 The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial on November 16, 2006, and he sentenced defendant on March 28, 2007 to four concurrent sentences of twenty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), ten years to serve, ten years suspended, with probation. On that same day, defendant moved in this Court for bail, pending appeal, which this Court granted. This Court affirmed defendant’s conviction on May 6, 2011. See State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 61 (R.I. 2011). On June 1, 2011, defendant filed a motion to reduce his sentence under the provisions of Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal 1', 'Because this case follows Lynch’s earlier direct appeal of his conviction, we will limit our discussion of the facts only to those necessary to decide the issues before us.

The jury found defendant not guilty on three counts of first-degree sexual assault, about which there was conflicting testimony.

The appeal was not timely filed; defendant therefore sought review by this Court by means of a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted on December 15, 2011. 6', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 is ‘essentially a plea for leniency.’” State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v.

We will interfere with a trial justice’s decision on a Rule 35 motion only in “rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Scanlon, 30 A.3d at 1261 (quoting State v. Mollicone, 746 A.2d 135, 137 (R.I. 2000)). “[T]he burden of showing that the sentence imposed violated this standard” falls squarely on the defendant. Mendoza, 958 A.2d at 1162 (quoting State v. Furtado, 774 A.2d 38, 39 (R.I. 2001)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, Lynch, in essence, presents the same arguments that he proffered in the memorandum supporting his motion to reduce his sentence in the Superior Court. The defendant argues that his sentence should be reduced because his health problems and age place him “in circumstances far different from those of most defendants,” circumstances which impose “a far heavier burden upon him than most inmates must bear.” Lynch also urges that his good behavior is a factor that warranted leniency in his case. Indeed, defendant argues that the trial justice should have reduced his sentence even though he acknowledged that the sentence imposed on him “constitutes the minimum sentence recommended under the criminal sentencing benchmarks for these crimes.” 7 After a thorough review of the record in this case, we hold that defendant has not met his burden of demonstrating that his sentence should be reduced or that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied the motion. 7', 'In fact, Benchmark 31B of the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks, entitled “Multiple counts with or without injury,” recommends fifteen to twenty-five years imprisonment. The statute, § 11-37-3, allows for the imposition of anywhere between ten years and life.', '-4-', 'When he or she imposes a sentence on a criminal defendant, “a trial justice considers a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment background, the potential for rehabilitation, social deterrence, and the appropriateness of punishment.” State v. Chhoy Hak, 30 A.3d 626, 628 (R.I. 2011) (citing State v. Tiernan, 645 A.2d 482, 484 (R.I. 1994)). It is very clear to us from the record that, during the hearing on defendant’s motion, the trial justice stressed that he had considered defendant’s age and health when he imposed the sentence. In fact, the trial justice noted that the Superior Court did “all that was within its power to assure itself that the defendant would be properly medically treated when he arrived at the [ACI].” In making his decision, the trial justice emphasized the large population of inmates at the ACI—noting that “[a] number of them have complex medical issues that” are “similar to the medical issues that Mr. Lynch has.” Although Lynch argued that the ACI’s failure to properly medicate him on two occasions compelled the reduction of his sentence, the trial justice disagreed. He said, “the extent that that care may be unintentionally delayed, in this Court’s mind, is not a reason that this Court should consider in responding to a motion to reduce his sentence, and the Court will not do so.”', 'In considering defendant’s age, the trial justice emphasized that it had been defendant’s decision to seek bail pending appeal rather than to begin serving his time while his appeal was pending. 8 The trial justice said, “for the defendant to now come before this Court and say, ‘I am now four years older and, therefore, I should not be sentenced,’ reminds this Court of the story about the child who kills his parents and then asks the Court to take mercy on him because he’s an orphan.”', 'He observed that the sentence he imposed was less severe than had been recommended by the state, and at the time of sentencing the trial justice had recognized that 8', 'The trial justice did note that defendant was well within his rights to seek appeal and to seek bail pending the outcome of that appeal.', '-5- Lynch was sixty-four years old. The trial justice concluded that the sentence that he had imposed after trial was “more than reasonable, more than fair,” perhaps even “unfair to [the victim].”', 'The defendant’s argument that he had remained on good behavior while on bail pending appeal gains no traction; nothing less was expected of him. Indeed, by way of analogy, on numerous occasions this Court has held “that it is within a trial justice’s discretion to reserve consideration of a defendant’s ‘good behavior and rehabilitative efforts while in prison to the parole board.’” Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 953 (quoting State v. Ruffner, 5 A.3d 864, 868 (R.I. 2010)). Indeed, “[a]ppropriate prison behavior is expected of all inmates and is irrelevant to the factors considered by a trial justice when he or she initially imposes a sentence.” State v. Guzman, 794 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 2002). Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in declining to accord any weight to Lynch’s good behavior while on bail.', 'Ultimately, the trial justice reasoned that he took into consideration defendant’s “background, his age, the nature of the offenses, the harm that Mr. Lynch caused to [the victim] when it fashioned its original sentence.” 9', 'This Court repeatedly has said that it is “loathe to interfere with a trial justice’s discretionary resolution of a Rule 35 motion * * *.” Mendoza, 958 A.2d at 1162 (quoting State v. Smith, 676 A.2d 765, 767 (R.I. 1996)). Furthermore, this Court has held that “the power [to reduce a sentence] should be exercised only when the sentence is without justification and grossly disparate from sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Chhoy Hak, 30 A.3d at 9', 'Indeed, counsel for Lynch acknowledged that the trial justice was “well aware” of defendant’s case and “took many, many things into consideration” when pronouncing the sentence. In addition, counsel acknowledged that the Superior Court “has been well aware of” Lynch’s heart condition “for many years.”', '-6- 629 (quoting State v. Giorgi, 121 R.I. 280, 282, 397 A.2d 898, 899 (1979)). In our opinion, Lynch has not established to any degree that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied the motion to reduce his sentence. “The defendant bore a weighty burden in this case and ultimately failed to shoulder it because he is unable to demonstrate ‘that this matter is among those rarest of cases that would justify altering our strong policy against interference with the ruling of the trial justice.’” Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 955 (quoting State v. Dyer, 14 A.3d 227, 228 (R.I. 2011) (mem.)). The sentence imposed on Mr. Lynch was neither “beyond the power of the sentencing justice to impose, nor was it patently unjustified.” Scanlon, 30 A.3d at 1262 (quoting Furtado, 774 A.2d at 40).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court, and we remand the papers in this case to that tribunal.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2001, a justice of the Superior Court sentenced Perez to life imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of the first-degree murder of his mother. He then appealed to this Court, which', '-1- affirmed the conviction. 1 Perez then filed an application for postconviction relief on June 15, 2006, pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10. On October 13, 2006, a justice of the Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Perez in connection with his application. After a thorough examination of Perez’s claims, counsel determined that the issues raised therein were “wholly frivolous, without merit, and neither supported by existing law, nor by a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.”', 'Counsel further concluded that there were no other possible arguments that would support Perez’s application. In accordance with Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 135-37 (R.I. 2000), counsel moved to withdraw as attorney of record. He also filed a memorandum to support his motion to withdraw, which discussed the reasons underlying his opinion that each of Perez’s arguments was frivolous.', 'On March 20, 2007, a hearing was held on counsel’s motion to withdraw and, after finding that Perez’s arguments were meritless, the hearing justice granted the motion. He then informed Perez of his right to pursue the matter without an attorney and permitted him to submit a memorandum containing any additional arguments that would support his request. On May 15, 2007, the hearing justice denied and dismissed Perez’s application, citing his failure to file any memorandum and finding no basis upon which it could be granted.

We shall address each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Motion to Withdraw as Attorney of Record', 'Perez argues that the hearing justice failed to follow the procedures set forth in Shatney and that he granted the motion to withdraw prematurely. Specifically, he maintains that he was not afforded a “full, fair, and counseled” opportunity to be heard.', 'In Shatney, 755 A.2d at 132, 134, counsel was appointed to represent an applicant for postconviction relief because the Public Defender’s office was unable to do so.', 'After he reviewed the applicant’s case, appointed counsel determined that the application lacked merit,', '-3- and he sought to withdraw from the matter.

Counsel filed a twenty-eight page “no-merit” memorandum explaining the reasons why he believed each of Perez’s claims lacked merit. A hearing on the motion, at which Perez was present, then was conducted. After reviewing Perez’s arguments, the hearing justice found that each of them was waived, previously litigated on direct appeal, or devoid of merit. Finally, the record reveals that the hearing justice informed Perez of his right to proceed in the matter pro se, and Perez acknowledged his intent to do just that. Therefore, it is our firm opinion that all of', '-4- the procedural requirements of Shatney were followed and that the hearing justice made no error when he granted counsel’s motion to withdraw. 2', 'B', 'Denial and Dismissal of Application for Postconviction Relief', 'Perez also argues that he was not afforded an opportunity to reply to the hearing justice’s proposed dismissal of his application, as required by § 10-9.1-6(b) and Toole v. State, 713 A.2d 1264 (R.I. 1998). Further, he contends that if he had been provided with an opportunity to reply, he would have raised four additional issues that he did not raise in his original application.', 'Section 10-9.1-6(b) sets forth the procedure for entry of a judgment on the pleadings in postconviction relief matters. That section states, in pertinent part:', '“When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application,', 'the answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not', 'entitled to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served', 'by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its', 'intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing.', 'The applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the', 'proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the', 'court may order the application dismissed * * *.” Id. In Toole, 713 A.2d at 1265-66, this Court held that a hearing justice is not obligated to conduct an evidentiary hearing in connection with an application for postconviction relief if there exists no genuine issue of material fact; however, the hearing justice must give the applicant an opportunity to reply to the hearing justice’s proposed dismissal of the application. 2', 'Perez also argues that the hearing justice ignored the language in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 136 (R.I. 2000), requiring that he and his counsel be afforded “an opportunity to be heard on whether any arguable basis exist[ed] to proceed with the application.” It is obvious from the record that the hearing justice heard from both Perez and his counsel at the hearing on March 20, 2007 about the merit of Perez’s application. Therefore, it is clear to us that the hearing justice satisfied this Shatney requirement.', '-5-', 'In this case, it is abundantly clear from the record that Perez was afforded an opportunity to reply to the hearing justice’s proposed dismissal of his application and that § 10-9.1-6(b) was complied with fully. At the March 20, 2007 hearing, the hearing justice informed Perez that the issues raised in his application had no merit, but he nonetheless generously allowed Perez to file another memorandum if he wished to further pursue the matter. At the same time, the hearing justice cautioned Perez that if he did not file an additional memorandum within ten days, his application would be “summarily rejected.” Despite this warning, the hearing justice granted a motion for an extension of time, allowing Perez until April 13, 2007 to amend his application. The hearing justice even provided Perez with an additional month after that extended deadline before he entered the order denying and dismissing his application.', 'Perez never filed a response. 3 Thus, we are perplexed to discern any basis for Perez’s contention on appeal that he was not afforded an opportunity to reply.', 'Moreover, § 10-9.1-6(b) says that when an opportunity to reply to a proposed dismissal of an application has been given, the court is permitted to dismiss the application “[i]n light of the reply, or on default thereof.” (Emphasis added). There can be no doubt that Perez was given ample opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal of his application, but he failed to respond. Therefore, the hearing justice did not err when he denied and dismissed his application.', 'Before this Court, Perez brings to light four new arguments that were not raised in his application, but which he believes have merit. 4 However, it is clear that these arguments involve 3', 'Perez contends that he sent an amended application to the clerk of the Superior Court in accordance with the order of April 3, 2007, granting his motion for an extension of time to amend his application. This alleged amended application never found its way into the file and there is no record of such a document. Therefore, we can give it no credit in our analysis. 4', 'We note that, on appeal, Perez failed to press any of the issues that appeared in his application to the Superior Court, with the exception of claim XIV. Additionally, while Perez mentions claim XIV in passing, he fails to develop any argument for us to review. Because those', '-6- alleged errors at Perez’s murder trial. The first three arguments involve the admissibility of certain expert testimony and the fourth contends that the trial justice improperly instructed the jury on first-degree murder.', 'It is well settled that this Court will not consider issues that were “not raised with the hearing justice in the first instance.” Brown v. State, 841 A.2d 1116, 1121 (R.I. 2004). Moreover, such issues are precluded from being raised at this time by § 10-9.1-8, which states that “[a]ll grounds for relief available to an applicant at the time he or she commences a proceeding under this chapter must be raised in his or her original, or a supplemental or amended, application.” Here, Perez readily admits in his brief that the four issues which he now raises “were not brought up in” his application. Additionally, Perez did not raise these issues after he was given ample opportunity to do so at the March 20, 2007 hearing. Therefore, Perez is precluded from raising them on appeal.', 'Moreover, even if these issues were properly before us, they would not afford him relief or a different disposition in this case, because they are not the proper subject matter of a postconviction-relief application, but rather should have been raised on direct appeal. The doctrine of res judicata in postconviction-relief matters is codified in § 10-9.1-8. That section states that “[a]ny ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted in the conviction or sentence or in any other proceeding the applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a subsequent application * * *.” Id. arguments were not developed in any meaningful way on appeal, we decline to review them. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007) (“A mere passing reference to an argument * * *, without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.”).', '-7-', 'Here, Perez calls into question three issues involving the admission of expert testimony and one concerning an allegedly improper jury instruction. These matters could have been raised on direct appeal from his conviction, but were not, and, therefore, “may not be the basis for” his postconviction-relief application. Section 10-9.1-8. We have no hesitation in concluding that the hearing justice did not err when he denied Perez’s application.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

(Multi-State) and Performance Adjusting Public Insurance Adjusters, LLC (Performance) (collectively the plaintiffs) appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court that dismissed their claims against DWS Properties, LLC (DWS or defendant). 1 This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 31, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The plaintiffs’ complaint contained claims about properties at 25 Andem Street and 79 Marshall Street in Providence. However, only the claims relating to 25 Andem Street were dismissed, and it is they alone that are before this Court. The claims relating to 79 Marshall Street later were resolved and, therefore, are not before us.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'DWS is a Rhode Island limited liability company (LLC) that is in the business of owning real estate. The sole member of the company is Dustin Shore. DWS owns rental property at 25 Andem Street in Providence, which property, at the times relevant to this appeal, was insured by the Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Association (RIJRA). Performance is a public insurance adjusting company that represents homeowners and businesses with regard to insurance claims. Multi-State, according to the affidavit of William R. D’Amico, II, is an insurance remediation company that provides restoration and construction services to damaged properties. D’Amico is the sole member and manager of Performance as well as the president of Multi-State.', 'On December 23, 2009, a sewer pipe burst at 25 Andem Street, causing substantial damage to the basement and foundation of the property. Shore subsequently executed contracts with Performance and Multi-State, in which Performance agreed to provide public adjusting services relative to the loss resulting from the ruptured pipe and subsequent vandalism, and Multi-State agreed to perform emergency clean-up work at the property. Performance adjusted the insurance claims with RIJRA and achieved a settlement of $5,852 for loss of rent and $62,311.66 for cleanup and restoration. Additionally, pursuant to a separately written contract, Multi-State provided cleanup services at the property, including the rental of safety fencing and equipment used to temporarily secure the foundation. The plaintiffs alleged that they never were paid for the services that they provided.', 'Shore and his wife then filed for personal bankruptcy; in his filing with the bankruptcy court, he claimed that the debts owed to plaintiffs were personal to him. In the course of the bankruptcy proceeding these debts were discharged under 11 U.S.C. § 727 of the Bankruptcy', '-2- Code. The plaintiffs filed suit in the Superior Court against DWS, the LLC that owns 25 Andem Street. In their complaint, plaintiffs sought damages for book account, breach of contract, quasi- contract and unjust enrichment.', 'DWS moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. In its motion, DWS maintained that it was not a party to any contract with plaintiffs and, therefore, that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief. The plaintiffs then filed an objection to DWS’s motion, and they also countered with a motion for summary judgment. At a hearing held on May 10, 2011, the hearing justice said that she was inclined to grant DWS’s motion to dismiss based on plaintiffs’ invoices that were attached to the complaint. Those invoices refer only to Shore as the customer, and not to DWS. The trial justice then went on to consider the contracts that Shore executed with plaintiffs that were not attached to their complaint. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing justice granted DWS’s motion to dismiss, reasoning that Shore had signed the contracts in an individual capacity, without making any reference to DWS.', 'The plaintiffs then filed a motion for relief and/or for clarification, in which they asked the hearing justice to vacate her order or to clarify whether she had treated DWS’s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, because materials outside the four corners of the complaint had been considered. The plaintiffs also requested that the hearing justice specifically state her reasoning for dismissing the equitable claims of quasi-contract and unjust enrichment. The hearing justice denied plaintiffs’ motion for relief and entered a final judgment for DWS. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has held that the “sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Laurence v. Sollitto, 788 A.2d 455, 456 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Rhode Island Affiliate, ACLU, Inc. v. Bernasconi, 557 A.2d 1232, 1232 (R.I. 1989)). “When ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion [to dismiss], the trial justice must look no further than the complaint, assume that all allegations in the complaint are true, and resolve any doubts in a plaintiff’s favor.” Laurence, 788 A.2d at 456 (quoting Bernasconi, 557 A.2d at 1232). “The motion may then only be granted if it ‘appears beyond a reasonable doubt that a plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any conceivable set of facts * * *.’” Id. (quoting Bernasconi, 557 A.2d at 1232).', 'However, when ruling on a motion to dismiss, if “matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 * * *.” Rule 12(b)(6). Furthermore, this Court has held that “when the motion justice receives evidentiary matters outside the complaint and does not expressly exclude them in passing on the motion, then Rule 12(b)(6) specifically requires the motion to be considered as one for summary judgment.” Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 298 (R.I. 2001).', 'When a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is converted to a motion for summary judgment, this Court shall review plaintiffs’ appeal de novo. See DeSantis v.

See DeSantis, 891 A.2d at 876. Here, defendant presented materials to the hearing justice that were not contained within the four corners of plaintiffs’ complaint. These extraneous materials included a copy of the notice of Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the schedule of creditors, in which plaintiffs were listed. The documents were attached as exhibit A to DWS’s memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, but were neither mentioned in, nor attached to, plaintiffs’ complaint. 2', 'In addition, at the hearing DWS submitted copies of the contracts that Shore had executed with plaintiffs to the hearing justice. These documents also were not attached to the complaint. 3 The record reveals that the hearing justice failed to expressly exclude these contracts from her consideration and then specifically relied on them when she rendered her decision. 2', 'We note that, in the context of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, it was proper for the hearing justice to consider plaintiffs’ invoices because they were attached to the complaint and, as such, were “deemed incorporated therein by reference.” Bowen Court Associates v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 818 A.2d 721, 725-26 (R.I. 2003). 3', 'At the hearing, both parties asserted that plaintiffs attached the contracts to their “responsive pleading.” However, the only pleading filed by plaintiffs was the complaint, to which no contracts were attached. However, the contracts were attached to an affidavit of William D’Amico, which was submitted with plaintiffs’ objection to DWS’s motion to dismiss and counter-motion for summary judgment. It appears from the record that the parties were referring to that motion and that the contracts were not attached to the complaint.', '-5- When she granted DWS’s motion to dismiss, the hearing justice told plaintiffs’ counsel: “I’ve', '4 reviewed your answer, the attachments, and everything that I see in that contract.”', 'She then explained that she was dismissing plaintiffs’ claims because only Shore, and not DWS, was designated as the customer in the contracts. Thus, because materials outside the four corners of the complaint were considered by the hearing justice, the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) was converted to a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'When “ruling on a motion for summary judgment the [hearing] justice must consider affidavits and pleadings in the light most favorable to the opposing party, and only when it appears that no genuine issue of material fact is asserted can summary judgment be ordered.” O’Connor v. McKanna, 116 R.I. 627, 633, 359 A.2d 350, 353 (1976) (citing Marandola v. Hillcrest Builders, Inc., 102 R.I. 46, 227 A.2d 785 (1967)). In this case, an affidavit of William D’Amico appears in the record and must be considered in our de novo review of the motion for summary judgment. That affidavit, and the contracts attached to it, raises genuine issues of material fact.', 'The contracts entered into with Multi-State provide that the company was to perform “emergency services ONLY,” including “[b]oard-up, winterization, water extraction and any and all work ordered by the State and or Municipality and/or as required by Customer’s Insurance policy.” In D’Amico’s affidavit, he asserted that Multi-State performed “emergency foundation construction” and other emergency work in accordance with those contracts. However, DWS asserts that Multi-State performed much of this work several months after the pipe ruptured “and not under emergency circumstances.” There is no question that these are issues of material fact 4', 'When the hearing justice says she had reviewed plaintiffs’ answer, it appears that she was referring to their objection to DWS’s motion to dismiss.', '-6- that will require a fact-finder to determine exactly what work was performed, when such work was performed, under what circumstances it was performed, and whether there was a breach of the contract. Because these issues of fact still remain, summary judgment was inappropriate, and the trial justice erred in granting plaintiffs’ motion.', 'B', 'Equitable Claims', 'It is also our opinion that defendant’s motion should not have been granted on plaintiffs’ equitable claims for quasi-contract and unjust enrichment, and that DWS is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to those claims. At the hearing, the hearing justice offered little reason for dismissing plaintiffs’ equitable claims other than to reiterate that the contracts named Shore, and not DWS, as the customer. However, the fact that DWS was not explicitly named on the contracts does not entitle it to judgment as a matter of law on these claims.', '“This Court has held that ‘actions brought upon theories of unjust enrichment and quasi- contract are essentially the same.’” Bouchard v. Price, 694 A.2d 670, 673 (R.I. 1997) (quoting R & B Electric Co. v. Amco Construction Co., 471 A.2d 1351, 1355 (R.I. 1984)). Furthermore,', '“in order to recover under quasi-contract for unjust enrichment, a', 'plaintiff is required to prove three elements: (1) a benefit must be', 'conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff, (2) there must be', 'appreciation by the defendant of such benefit, and (3) there must', 'be an acceptance of such benefit in such circumstances that it', 'would be inequitable for a defendant to retain the benefit without', 'paying the value thereof.” Id.

Building Contractors, 589 A.2d 1201, 1201-02 (R.I.', '1991)).', 'After reviewing the limited evidence contained in the record, we conclude that plaintiffs were wrongfully deprived of their opportunity to satisfy the elements necessary to recover under a theory of quasi-contract or unjust enrichment. Indeed, even DWS does not argue that there is', '-7- no scenario under which plaintiffs would be able to satisfy these elements. Instead, DWS contends that plaintiffs’ equitable claims were properly dismissed because G.L. 1956 chapter 28 of title 34 (the Mechanics’ Liens statute) provided them an adequate remedy at law, thereby precluding plaintiffs from proceeding on any equitable remedies.', 'Although it is generally true that there must be no adequate remedy at law for a plaintiff to proceed in equity, here, the express language of § 34-28-33 specifically allows for plaintiffs to pursue remedies in addition to those provided for in the Mechanics’ Liens statute. See Wickes Asset Management, Inc. v. Dupuis, 679 A.2d 314, 322 (R.I. 1996). Specifically, § 34-28-33 says that “nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the right of any person * * * to remedies otherwise available to him or her under law * * *.” Furthermore, “the rights * * * of any person,” whether or not he or she has filed a claim under § 34-28-16, “shall not be impaired by the provisions of [the Mechanics’ Liens statute].” 5 Section 34-28-33. Based on this language, it is our opinion that the Mechanics’ Liens statute does not preclude plaintiffs from pursuing their claims in equity.

(Custom Metals), appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Providence Builders, LLC and Tocci Building Corp. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear in order to show cause why the issues raised in the appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this order, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Analysis', 'The crucial issue in this case is whether Custom Metals was required, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 7-1.2-1418, to maintain a certificate of authority throughout the duration of the instant litigation. It is undisputed: (1) that Custom Metals was a Massachusetts corporation when it entered into a contract with defendants; and (2) that the contract was to be performed entirely', '-1- within Rhode Island. It is also undisputed that Custom Metals had a certificate of authority from the Secretary of State of Rhode Island when it commenced the instant civil action. At some point thereafter, the Secretary of State revoked the plaintiff corporation’s certificate of authority. The defendants subsequently moved to amend their answer to assert an affirmative defense that “plaintiff lack[ed] the capacity to sue in this state;” and, on the basis of that affirmative defense, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.', 'On March 3, 2011, a justice of the Superior Court converted defendants’ motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion justice then proceeded to conditionally grant summary judgment in favor of defendants; the motion justice reasoned that the plaintiff corporation did not have a certificate of authority to transact business in Rhode Island in violation of § 7-1.2-1418 and that it therefore lacked the capacity to sue in this state. Although the motion justice granted the plaintiff corporation thirty days within which to seek reinstatement or issuance of the proper certificate, the plaintiff corporation failed to do so; final judgment was entered on April 27, 2011. 1', 'On appeal, the plaintiff corporation argues that the motion justice erred in granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment; it alleges that her decision in that regard was based upon an incorrect interpretation of § 7-1.2-1418. The plaintiff corporation additionally contends 1', 'A dismissal for lack of capacity ordinarily does not constitute a final judgment on the merits, and therefore such a dismissal would not preclude a plaintiff from proceeding in a separate action. See Pilot’s Point Marina, Inc. v. Cazzani Power Boat Manufacturing, Inc., 745 A.2d 782, 784 (R.I. 2000). In the instant case, however, the motion justice entered a final judgment in favor of defendants after granting summary judgment, thereby precluding Custom Metals from initiating a separate action.', '-2- that § 7-1.2-1418 imposes an unconstitutional burden on a foreign corporation in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.', 'Section 7-1.2-1418 reads in pertinent part:', '“(a) No foreign corporation transacting business in this', 'state without a certificate of authority is permitted to maintain any', 'action, suit, or proceeding in any court of this state, until the', 'corporation has obtained a certificate of authority.

The plaintiff corporation points to the explicit statutory provision that “[m]aintaining or defending any action or suit” is “not considered to be transacting business in this state.” Section 7-1.2-1401(b)(1). 2', 'Relying upon that statutory provision, the plaintiff corporation 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 7-1.2-1401(b)(1) reads as follows:', '“(b) Without excluding other activities which may not constitute', 'transacting business in this state, a foreign corporation is not', 'considered to be transacting business in this state, for the purposes', 'of this chapter, because of carrying on in this state any one or more', 'of the following activities:', '“(1) Maintaining or defending any action or suit or any', 'administrative or arbitration proceeding, or effecting the', '-3- contends that, when summary judgment was granted, it was not “transacting business” within the state and therefore was not required to obtain a certificate from the Secretary of State pursuant to § 7-1.2-1418. Although we have previously indicated that “that an out-of-state corporation that brings action against a Rhode Island defendant based upon a contract performed within this state must obtain a certificate of authority before proceeding to final judgment,” the instant case had not yet proceeded to such a judgment.

It is noteworthy that before he arrived at Sportman’s Inn that evening, plaintiff had ingested ecstasy. 1 While socializing during the night, plaintiff said he drank about five alcoholic beverages, including both mixed drinks and beer.', 'The plaintiff left Sportman’s Inn at around 2 a.m., and said that the next thing he remembers was hearing a gunshot, falling to the ground, and waking up in a hospital.', 'On or about June 2, 2009, plaintiff filed a civil action against Sportsman’s Inn and DLM, Inc. In his complaint, he alleged that he was shot as a result of the failure of both defendants to provide adequate security at the business. 2', 'On December 22, 2009, plaintiff learned that the property at 122 Fountain Street was for sale. He moved with alacrity for a temporary restraining order on the next day. A justice of the Superior Court granted his request and assigned the matter for a hearing on a preliminary injunction. At that hearing, which took place on January 8, 2010, Sgt. Raymond Hull of the Providence Police Department, testifying under subpoena as a keeper of records, documented the number of police service calls to the Sportsman’s Inn and its immediate vicinity. The records 1', 'Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also known as MDMA or “ecstasy,” “is a synthetic, psychoactive drug that is chemically similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline.

Hull estimated that the total number of service calls to that location was about 800. 3', 'David Deluca, president of Sportsman’s Inn, Inc. also testified at the hearing for preliminary injunction. He explained that Sportsman’s Inn, Inc. and DLM, Inc. shared the same building, office, phone number, office supplies, and insurance policy. He testified that both entities were engaged in the same business of hotel/lounge and services, and that the companies also had common officers. Michael A. Deluca and his nephew, David Deluca, oversaw all the daily operations of both corporations. David Deluca also testified that he did not “know of any corporate formalities that have been followed,” and that since 1995, neither Sportsman’s Inn nor DLM, Inc. had conducted any annual meetings of the board of directors or shareholders, and no minutes had been kept. He also explained that whatever business needs DLM, Inc. and DLM Realty had were met by the efforts of Sportsman’s Inn’s employees, because neither DLM, Inc. nor DLM Realty had any employees.', 'Deluca also was examined about corporate assets. He testified that DLM, Inc. had about $30,000 in capital; DLM Realty, LLC (DLM Realty), which was merely a holding company that owned all the stock of DLM, Inc., had no other assets; and Sportsman’s Inn lacked substantial capital, but he added that it did own bar equipment and two motor vehicles, a Land Rover and a Honda. He said that he was not sure whether Sportsman’s Inn paid rent to DLM, Inc. David Deluca also testified that if a substantial judgment were to be rendered against Sportsman’s Inn, it would likely declare bankruptcy. 3', 'The record revealed that there actually were 667 calls between January 1, 1996, and approximately 2 a.m. on November 12, 2006, when Vasquez was wounded. This impressive number includes, but is not limited to, seventy-three public disturbances, fourteen assaults, twenty aggravated assaults, five robberies, one shot fired, three sexual assaults, twenty threats, twenty-two larcenies, one abduction/kidnapping, four breaking and enterings, and four indecent exposures.', '-3-', 'David Deluca further testified that Sportsman’s Inn no longer had a parking area of its own. He also explained that, while there were no bouncers 4 or security personnel outside the establishment, three bouncers generally were on duty inside: one at the Fountain Street entrance, one at the Martha Street entrance, and one in the back room. However, on the night of the incident described in the complaint, just one manager and only one bouncer were on duty. He said a metal detecting wand was used to prevent people from bringing dangerous objects into Sportsman’s Inn.', 'At a later hearing, Gene Carlino, an attorney, testified about the formation of the corporations. He said that on December 20, 2001, DLM Realty was established, and the two shareholders of DLM, Inc., Michael A. Deluca and Michael Deluca, transferred their stock interests to DLM Realty, thereby creating a parent-subsidiary relationship between DLM Realty and DLM, Inc. Attorney Carlino explained that DLM Realty was established to take advantage of certain tax benefits.', 'Finally, Jane Lattinville, a certified public accountant, offered testimony. She explained that it was she who prepared the corporate tax return for all three entities: Sportsman’s Inn, DLM, Inc., and DLM Realty. She testified that in 2006, Sportman’s Inn’s taxable income was $25,427, after expenses. Those expenses included a rent payment of $247,000 to DLM, Inc. 5 Lattinville also clarified that DLM, Inc. had failed to file its annual report for a few years because of oversight, resulting in the revocation of the corporate charter in 2008. Lattinville said that she then completed the necessary procedure and the charter was reinstated. 4', 'The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines the term “bouncer” as meaning “[a] person employed to expel disorderly persons from a public place, especially a bar.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 217 (5th ed. 2011). 5', 'According to the witness, DLM, Inc.’s tax returns provided “no activity” because the tax returns were reported under DLM Realty.', '-4-', 'On May 19, 2010, the Superior Court issued an “Order (Regarding Motion to Attach and Corporate Identities),” in which the trial justice found that the overall finances of DLM, Inc. and Sportsman’s Inn were closely intertwined. 6 The trial justice reasoned that: both corporations shared the same building, offices, owners, and officers; DLM, Inc. and Sportsman’s Inn did not keep minutes nor did they hold elections in accordance with the bylaws; DLM, Inc.’s charter had been revoked on October 20, 2008; and David Deluca, the chief operating officer, was unaware of whether Sportsman’s Inn paid rent or filed tax returns. The trial justice determined that the businesses were sufficiently capitalized, but he expressed a concern that DLM, Inc.’s only income was Sportsman’s Inn’s rent payments. Finally, the trial justice concluded that even though he could not specifically find that one corporation dominated the affairs of the other, he nonetheless inferred that the same principals dominated the finances, policies, and practices of each entity. Based on these findings, the trial justice concluded that “Vasquez has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that the corporate formalities will be disregarded.” 7', 'The trial justice also issued an “Order (Regarding Motion to Attach in a Tort Action)” on July 15, 2010, in which he denied Vasquez’s motion to attach the assets of the corporations. The trial justice reasoned that the prejudgment attachment of property is not authorized in tort 6', 'The parties agree that a motion to attach the real estate was not an issue before the trial justice. However, when the trial justice made the determination that the corporate entities would be disregarded for the purposes of Vasquez’s pending motion for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, he directed the parties to address whether attachment was an appropriate remedy. 7', 'This is otherwise known as piercing the corporate veil.

Derek V. Campbell, a rescue technician for the Providence Fire Department, testified during that hearing. It was Campbell who had drafted the “Run Report” that summarized the response to the emergency call on November 12, 2006. The Run Report indicated that a male was “found on ground outside of club”; Campbell explained that it was his recollection that Vasquez was “outside of the doors in close proximity to the club.” He cautioned, however, that he could not remember specific details of the incident, nor could he recall exactly where the injured plaintiff was found.', 'The court next heard from plaintiff himself. He testified that he “remember[ed] hearing [a] gunshot and falling down to the floor,” but he said he had no specific memory of who shot him. He explained that he consumed ecstasy before entering the club and “probably [had] about five” beers and mixed drinks when he was at Sportsman’s Inn. Significantly, Vasquez was not questioned and did not testify about whether he had been engaged in any arguments or altercations inside Sportsman’s Inn on that night.', 'Finally, John Marques, a Sportsman’s Inn manager who worked the night of the incident, testified. He explained that there was no security posted outside the building, but if a patron became loud and disorderly inside the club, the practice was to “[g]o up to the gentleman, see what the problem [was], obviously try to put it under control * * * [and] [i]f you can’t[,] you ask 8', 'We note that prejudgment attachment may, in certain circumstances, be available in tort actions, although “the remedy of attachment shall not be generally available under the provisions of [G.L. 1956] § 10-5-2 when the cause of action is one sounding in tort.” Martin v.

If you can’t ask them to leave, you call the police.” He also said that during the seven years that he was a manager, there were “about five little arguments there, maybe, that [he] remember[ed].”', 'After the hearing, the trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion to enjoin the sale of the property. He concluded that Vasquez had established a likelihood of success that the corporate formalities should be disregarded and that Sportsman’s Inn had breached its duty of reasonable care to him.', 'Specifically, the order concluded that the “[d]efendants [were] enjoined and restrained from alienating, conveying[,] or encumbering their real estate on Fountain Street in Providence until further order of this Court.” The trial justice attached two conditions to his order: first, defendants could seek Court approval for modification of the order in the event of a change in circumstances, and second, the order would remain in effect only until November 17, 2011. On November 17, 2010, the trial justice’s decision was reduced to an order.', 'On January 22, 2011, defendants timely appealed the decision of the trial justice. 9 In their appeal, defendants maintain that the trial justice abused his discretion in finding that plaintiff had demonstrated that there was a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of the negligence claim and that the corporate veil should be pierced.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7, an order granting a preliminary injunction may be appealed directly to this Court. 10 “[B]ecause the decision to grant * * * a preliminary injunction ‘rests 9', 'While this appeal has been pending, DLM, Inc. sold the property, after authorization from the trial justice, and deposited approximately 1.4 million dollars in the Superior Court Registry. 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-24-7 provides, in pertinent part:', '“Whenever, upon a hearing in the [S]uperior [C]ourt, an', 'injunction shall be granted or continued, or a receiver appointed, or', 'a sale of real or personal property ordered, by an interlocutory', '-7- within the sound discretion of the hearing justice,’ we review that decision under an abuse-of- discretion standard of review.” Town of Coventry v.

Further, Vasquez argues that the trial justice properly exercised his discretion in finding irreparable harm because of the potential for an enormous damages award juxtaposed with Sportsman’s Inn’s limited assets. 11', '“To prevail on a claim of negligence, ‘a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.’” Ouch v.

As a preliminary matter, we first must determine whether Sportsman’s Inn owed Vasquez a duty of care, the existence of which is a question of law. See id. To determine whether a duty exists in a specific case, the Court considers “‘the particular facts and circumstances of a given case’ * * * taking into consideration ‘all relative factors, including the relationship between the parties, the scope and burden of the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, public policy considerations,’ * * * and the ‘foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff.’” Id.

We have held that a causational link to a drinking establishment reasonably may be inferred from evidence that the incidents occurred in the proximity of a particular establishment “and had their origins within.” A.J.C. Enterprises v. Pastore, 473 A.2d 269, 275 (R.I. 1984) (emphasis added). Here, the trial justice supported his conclusion by finding that “[a]t some point” that night, Vasquez had been in an argument with “another patron of the inn” and he was shot “[w]ithin 50 yards of the front', '- 10 - door.” However, the trial justice cited to no evidence in the record to support this finding, and, after a careful review of the record, we discern that there is no evidence to support it. 12', 'Accordingly, we hold that the record as it stands does not adequately demonstrate a prima facie showing that Sportsman’s Inn breached any duty to Vasquez. The testimony and the evidence before us fall far short of linking the shooting with Vasquez’s visit to Sportsman’s Inn or with any person who was on the premises during the evening in question. There is no evidence in the record that Sportsman’s Inn had any knowledge of, connection to, or control over the conduct of a gunman or that it possibly could have predicted the events of that evening. Similarly, there was no evidence during the hearing that Vasquez engaged in any altercations while he patronized Sportsman’s Inn or that the shooter was a patron of Sportsman’s Inn that night. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice abused his discretion and clearly was wrong when he found that Vasquez had shown a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits in his claim against defendants. 12', 'The only potential support for the trial justice’s finding that Vasquez was in an argument with another patron of the bar and that it was this same person who shot Vasquez later in the evening is Vasquez’s affidavit in support of his motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief, dated December 23, 2005. In that affidavit, plaintiff swore that while he was at Sportsman’s Inn, “[He] got into a loud verbal altercation with other unknown guests inside of the club,” and “[a]s [he] exited the club, it [was his] understanding that the same men with whom [he] had earlier argued approached [him] directly outside of the club and again began a verbal altercation.” It was “[d]uring this second altercation [that] one of the men brandished a handgun and [he] was shot.” That document, however, was not submitted into evidence during the hearings. The plaintiff’s answers to Sportsman’s Inn’s interrogatories, dated August 28, 2009, also provide that', '“[He] do[es] not remember the shooting. [He] know[s] that several', 'of [his] friends and [he] went to the Sportsman’s Inn and while', 'inside the Sportsman’s Inn[,] [he] got into an argument with a', 'black male. [He] know[s] that [he] was shot by a black male while', '[he and his friends] tried to leave the Sportsman’s Inn.” Similarly, this document was not submitted into evidence during the hearings.', '- 11 -', 'At this point, we believe we must turn our attention to the comments of the trial justice about disregarding the corporate formalities between Sportsman’s Inn, DLM, Inc., and DLM Realty. We carefully have read the trial justice’s decision and have concluded that he did not make a definitive ruling on this issue; he did consider it within his analysis of whether injunctive relief was appropriate, but certainly not to the extent that the law of the case has been established on that issue. 13', 'In our opinion, a “piercing of the corporate veil” analysis is unnecessary at this stage of litigation. We have explained that, in considering the criteria for piercing the corporate veil,', '“one overriding factor is omnipresent: ‘the corporate entity should', 'be disregarded and treated as an association of persons only when', 'the facts of a particular case render it unjust and inequitable to', 'consider the subject corporate entity a separate entity.’ * * * Such', 'facts may be present, for example, ‘when the corporate entity is', 'used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or', 'defend crime.’” Doe v.

In Doe, this Court cited with approval several passages from William Meade Fletcher for guidance on whether to pierce the corporate veil. Doe, 732 A.3d at 48-49. Specifically, Fletcher explains that to pierce a corporate veil, “the corporation must first be assumed liable.” 1 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 41.28 at 166 (2006). This is because “[a]n attempt to pierce the corporate veil is not itself a cause of action but rather is a means of imposing liability on an underlying cause of action, such as a tort or breach of 13', '“Law of the case is a discretionary doctrine that prefers consistent rulings on the same issues when they occur at the same judicial level, not when the issues are propounded to a reviewing court.” In re Review of Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 523-24 (R.I. 2011) (citing and quoting Taveira v.

The defendant, International Fidelity Insurance Company (IFIC or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Drago Custom Interiors, LLC (Drago or plaintiff). The defendant contends that the Superior Court was without authority either to remand the case back to the arbitrator for clarification of the record or to modify the arbitration award. After considering the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment.', 'In April 2003, Carlisle Building Systems, Inc. (Carlisle), the general contractor for a construction project (project) at the Charlestown Fire Station at Routes 2 and 112, contracted with Drago to perform carpentry work for the project. In accordance with the contract between Carlisle and the Charlestown Fire District (fire district), a Labor and Material Payment Bond (bond) was issued for the project; Carlisle was principal on the bond, and IFIC was the surety. Drago alleges that the bond guaranteed payment, from either Carlisle or IFIC, to any entity', '-1- supplying labor or material to the project and that Drago performed work on the project for which it had not been paid. Accordingly, on July 20, 2005, Drago filed suit against Carlisle and IFIC, seeking to recover payment for the work that it had performed.', 'In its answer, IFIC admitted that it was the surety on the bond. However, because the project fell under the purview of the Public Works Arbitration Act (PWAA or act), G.L. 1956 chapter 16 of title 37, and the contract between Carlisle and the fire district contained an arbitration provision, IFIC and Carlisle moved to stay the Superior Court proceedings pending arbitration of Drago‟s claims. See §§ 37-16-4 and 37-16-5. Notwithstanding Drago‟s objection, the case began a long sojourn through arbitration.', 'After two days of hearings, the arbitrator issued his first award on March 26, 2008, finding Carlisle liable to Drago for $43,543.02, plus interest. However, because there was no evidence introduced that IFIC issued any bonds relative to the project or was responsible for any damages claimed by Drago, the arbitrator determined that IFIC was not liable to Drago. Because Drago was unaware that IFIC was contesting its responsibility for Carlisle‟s liability to Drago for payment—IFIC having admitted in its answer that it was the surety—it requested that the arbitrator reopen the proceedings so that the bond could be received into evidence.', 'Instead, the arbitrator issued two amended awards. The arbitrator first amended his findings of fact by repeating his earlier finding that no evidence had been presented that IFIC had issued any bonds relative to the project, but adding that “[t]he issue of IFIC‟s liability was not asserted or denied during the arbitration hearings.” Nonetheless, the arbitrator concluded that IFIC was not liable to Drago but that the arbitration award was “without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC.”', 'In his second amended award, the arbitrator deleted the finding that the issue of IFIC‟s liability was neither', '-2- asserted nor denied during the arbitration hearings, but once again declared that his finding that IFIC was not liable to Drago was “without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC.”', 'Drago then returned to Superior Court and moved to confirm the second amended award concerning Carlisle‟s liability and to modify it as to IFIC so that IFIC would be liable if Carlisle did not pay.1 IFIC objected to the proposed modification, contending that none of the statutory grounds for modification of an arbitration award applied in this case. IFIC also moved to confirm the original award, asserting that the arbitrator had no authority to issue amended awards.', 'A hearing eventually was held on the parties‟ competing motions on February 11, 2011. The trial justice determined that, because IFIC failed to file a pre-arbitration statement and, in its answer to Drago‟s complaint, had admitted that it was on the bond, the issue of whether IFIC ever had disputed liability under the bond was “unclear.” The trial justice found that the arbitration hearings focused entirely on Carlisle‟s liability to Drago and that there was nothing to suggest that IFIC disputed its liability under the bond during the arbitration proceedings. The trial justice also pointed to two features of the arbitration awards that caused further uncertainty: (1) in his first amended award, the arbitrator had stated that the issue of IFIC‟s liability was neither asserted nor denied during the proceedings, only to delete that finding in his second amended award; and (2) despite changing that finding in the second amended award, the arbitrator‟s order declared that the award was “without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC.” Confronted with the uncertainty of whether IFIC ever had disputed that it was on the bond, the trial justice, relying on our 1', 'Apparently, Carlisle was unable to satisfy the award.', '-3- decision in Pier House Inn, Inc. v. 421 Corp., 812 A.2d 799 (R.I. 2002), concluded that the Superior Court possessed the inherent authority to remand the case back to the arbitrator for clarification. In accordance with this inherent authority, the trial justice remanded the matter back to the arbitrator yet again for determination of whether the issue of IFIC‟s liability under the bond was raised in the arbitration and for clarification of the phrase “without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC.”', 'Upon remand, the arbitrator issued a new award in which he found that, although there was no evidence presented at the initial arbitration hearings that IFIC issued a bond for the project, the issue of IFIC‟s liability was not raised in the initial proceedings and IFIC did not dispute either the existence of the bond or that it covered Drago‟s claims.2 The arbitrator concluded that both Carlisle and IFIC were liable to Drago for $43,543.02, plus interest, and the post-remand award reflected this conclusion.', 'Drago then moved to confirm the arbitrator‟s latest award. IFIC objected and moved to vacate that award and to confirm the original award. The trial justice expressed her concerns that IFIC contributed to this case‟s tortured travel, having admitted that it was the surety in its answer―thereby inducing Drago to refrain from introducing the bond at the arbitration proceedings―and then attempting to capitalize on this omission after the proceedings were closed.', 'The trial justice accordingly granted Drago‟s motion to confirm the post-remand arbitration award. Additionally, the trial justice noted that, even if she was without authority to order the remand, she would have granted Drago‟s motion to modify the second amended award because IFIC never had disputed the existence of the bond or its liability thereunder. Before this Court, IFIC contends that the trial justice was without authority to remand this case back to 2', 'The arbitrator did find, however, that IFIC denied that it was liable to Drago based on Carlisle‟s defenses to Drago‟s claims.', '-4- arbitration or to modify the second amended award as requested by Drago. Nine years after commencement of the project, this dispute is before us.', 'It is well settled that, in the typical case, the judiciary‟s role in the arbitration process is limited. Metropolitan Property & Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 918 (R.I. 2006) (citing Aponik v. Lauricella, 844 A.2d 698, 703 (R.I. 2004)); State v. Rhode Island Employment Security Alliance, Local 401, SEIU, AFL-CIO, 840 A.2d 1093, 1096 (R.I. 2003). When, as here, an arbitration provision is contained in a “contract for the construction, alteration, repair, painting, or demolition of any public building * * * one party to which is the state, a city, a town, or an authority, a board, a public corporation, or any similar body created by statute or ordinance * * *,” § 37-16-2(b)(1), the PWAA defines the contours of the judiciary‟s role. Specifically, the act directs that upon timely motion for an order confirming an arbitration award, “the court must grant the order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed in §§ 37-16-18 and 37-16-19 or unless the award is unenforceable under the provisions of § 37- 16-13.” Section 37-16-17.', 'Before this Court, IFIC contends that the PWAA delimits the universe of options available to a trial justice; the arbitration award can be affirmed, vacated, modified or corrected, but nothing more. The trial justice disagreed, reading our opinion in Pier House Inn as vesting her with the inherent authority to remand an arbitration case for clarification of the record. We disagree with the trial justice‟s reading of Pier House Inn.', 'In Pier House Inn, an arbitrator awarded approximately $4,000 in “compensatory damages” and $150,000 in what the arbitrator termed “punitive damages” on a commercial lessee‟s counterclaim for breach of contract. Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 801. The Superior Court vacated the punitive damages award and remanded the matter back to arbitration “to', '-5- determine whether that [portion of the award awarding punitive damages] was in whole or in part intended to be compensatory.” Id. at 804. On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial justice‟s decision to vacate the punitive damages award, id. at 803, and then tackled the thorny issue of the Superior Court‟s authority to remand. See id. at 804-07.', 'Despite holding that the trial justice erred in relying on G.L. 1956 § 10-3-13 as authority to remand the case back to the arbitrator, we upheld the remand on other grounds. Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 805. This Court explained that the “blatant discrepancy” in the award— awarding punitive damages to the lessee while, at the same time, finding that the lessee breached the lease, compounded by an award of attorneys‟ fees to the lessor—“clearly exemplifies the type of award that § 10-3-14 authorizes a judge to modify or correct, in the interest of effectuating the intent of the award and promoting justice between the parties.” Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 805. We concluded that the award of punitive damages was an “evident material mistake” under § 10-3-14(a)(1). Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 805. This Court then determined that the remand was proper:', '“Although § 10-3-14 requires the reviewing court to modify the', 'award as necessary and does not expressly limit the hearing', 'justice‟s scope of review, under the circumstances of this case, the', 'remand to the arbitrator was appropriate, given the insufficient', 'evidence before the * * * hearing justice regarding the rationale for', 'the punitive damages award.” Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 806. Elaborating on the paucity of evidence, we noted that there was neither a transcript of the arbitration proceeding, nor an explication of the arbitrator‟s reasoning. Id. This Court thus declared that “[r]ather than rely on defendant‟s representations to modify the punitive damages award, the court properly sought a clarification from the arbitrator.” Id.', 'The precise holding of Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 805-06, although perhaps lacking pristine clarity, was that § 10-3-14 vested the trial justice with the authority to modify or correct', '-6- the award, but that the record before the trial justice was insufficient for him to exercise that authority. The uncertainty of whether the arbitrator intended the “punitive damages” award to be compensatory or punitive necessitated a remand to the arbitrator. Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 805-06. Our holding in Pier House Inn does not stand for the broader proposition that the Superior Court possesses the inherent authority, independent of an appropriate statutory basis, to remand an arbitration case back to the arbitrator to clarify the record.', 'In Pier House Inn, we cited our decision in Lemoine v. Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, 113 R.I. 285, 290, 320 A.2d 611, 614 (1974), wherein we held that a remand for clarification for the purpose of taking further evidence under the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42 (APA), “was part of the reviewing court‟s „inherent power * * * to correct deficiencies in the record and thus afford the litigants a meaningful review.‟” Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 806 (quoting Lemoine, 113 R.I. at 290, 320 A.2d at 614). However, Lemoine, in contrast to Pier House Inn and this case, involved a remand of an agency proceeding in accordance with § 42-35-15(g) of the APA and not an arbitration case. See Lemoine, 113 R.I. at 286-87, 290, 320 A.2d at 612-14 (affirming trial justice‟s remand of a personnel appeal board decision). Additionally, in Pier House Inn, we were careful to ground the trial justice‟s authority to remand within the provisions of § 10-3-14, noting that the decision “comports with the statutory mandate that the reviewing justice effectuate the intent of the award and „promote justice between the parties.‟ * * * But because of the minimal record, a remand was necessary to ascertain the arbitrator‟s intent.” Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 806 (quoting § 10-3-14(b)).', 'In the case before us, although we disagree with the trial justice‟s reading of Pier House Inn, we nonetheless affirm the decision on other grounds. See Pier House Inn, 812 A.2d at 805.', '-7- After carefully reviewing the record, we are convinced that the trial justice had clear grounds to vacate the second amended award. Once an award is vacated, the PWAA vests the Superior Court with discretion to order a rehearing before the original arbitrator(s) or before a new arbitrator or arbitrators. Section 37-16-19.3 We explain briefly.', 'Section 37-16-18 sets forth three instances when the court must, upon motion by any party, vacate the award:', '“(1) When the award was procured by fraud.', '“(2) Where the arbitrator or arbitrators exceeded their powers, or', 'so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final, and definite', 'award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.', '“(3) If there was no valid contract, and the objection has been', 'raised under the conditions set forth in § 37-16-13.”', 'In this case, a decision vacating the second amended award clearly was warranted. The trial justice properly determined that the arbitrator‟s findings with respect to the existence of the bond were indefinite and inconsistent. In his first award, the arbitrator found “that there was no evidence presented that IFIC issued any bonds relative to the [p]roject.”', 'Soon after, the arbitrator issued his first amended award, which added that “[t]he issue of IFIC‟s liability was not asserted or denied during the arbitration hearings.” Just days later, the arbitrator deleted this additional finding in his second amended award. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 37-16-19 provides:', '“Where an award is vacated, the court in its discretion may direct a', 'rehearing either before the same arbitrator or arbitrators or before a new arbitrator', 'or arbitrators to be chosen in the manner provided in the contract for the selection', 'of the original arbitrator or arbitrators or as provided for in § 37-16-7 and any', 'provision limiting the time in which the arbitrator or arbitrators may make a', 'decision shall be deemed applicable to the new arbitration and shall commence', 'from the date of the court‟s order.”', '-8-', 'Compounding this inconsistency was the arbitrator‟s treatment of IFIC‟s liability to Drago. In the original award, the arbitrator found, without qualification, that IFIC was “not liable to Drago for any claims or damages relative to the [p]roject.” This finding stands in stark contrast to the first and second amended awards, which provided that IFIC was not liable to Drago, but added that “[t]his Order is without prejudice to any rights of Drago as asserted in any pending litigation involving Drago and IFIC.” This language defeats the requirement that a “mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter” be made. Section 37-16-18(2).', 'The grave uncertainties infecting the second amended award, especially with respect to the “without prejudice” language, compel our conclusion that the arbitrator so imperfectly executed his powers that a final and definite award with respect to IFIC‟s liability was not made. See § 37-16-18(2) (providing that the court must vacate an arbitration award “[w]here the arbitrator or arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” (Emphasis added.)). Additionally, § 37-16-27(a)4 commands that, in an arbitration involving a surety, “[t]he 4', 'Section 37-16-27 provides as follows:', '“(a) If a contractor principal on a bond furnished to guarantee performance', 'or payment on a construction contract and the claimant are parties to a written', 'contract with a provision to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter', 'arising under the contract, or subject to arbitration as provided in § 37-16-2(b),', 'the arbitration provisions shall apply to the surety for all disputes involving', 'questions of the claimant‟s right of recovery against the surety. Either the', 'claimant, the contractor principal, or surety may demand arbitration in accordance', 'with the written contract or as provided in § 37-16-2(b) if applicable in one', 'arbitration proceeding, provided that the provisions of § 37-16-3 shall be', 'applicable to any demand for arbitration. The arbitration award shall decide all', 'controversies subject to arbitration between the claimant, on the one hand, and the', 'contractor principal and surety on the other hand, including all questions', 'involving liability of the contractor principal and surety on the bond, but a', 'claimant must file suit for recovery against the surety within the time limits set', '-9- arbitration award shall decide all controversies subject to arbitration between the claimant, on the one hand, and the contractor principal and surety on the other hand, including all questions involving liability of the contractor principal and surety on the bond * * *.” (Emphases added.) The arbitrator‟s decision in this case falls far short of the statutory mandate; an award entered “without prejudice to any rights of [the claimant] as asserted in any pending litigation involving [the claimant] and [the surety]” cannot, under any interpretation of the language, be considered “final” or “definite.”5', 'For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the second amended award should have been vacated under § 37-16-18(2) and that the trial justice was authorized, under § 37-16-19, to remand the case to the same arbitrator for a rehearing.', 'Because the remand in this case accomplished the same result that could have been accomplished under §§ 37-16-18 and', 'forth in §§ 37-12-2 and 37-12-5. The arbitration shall be in accordance with this', 'chapter and the court shall enter judgment thereon as provided therein.', '“(b) The arbitrator or arbitrators, if more than one, shall make findings of', 'fact as to the compliance with the requirements for recovery against the surety,', 'and those findings of fact shall be a part of the award binding on all parties to the', 'arbitration.” 5', 'We pause briefly to stress the unenviable position in which the Superior Court justice found herself. IFIC strenuously argued that Drago‟s failure to introduce the bond into evidence at the arbitration proceedings compelled the arbitrator‟s conclusion that IFIC was not liable to Drago— a position IFIC maintains on appeal. The trial justice found this argument to be unpersuasive because it overlooked the undeniable fact that IFIC had admitted the existence of the bond in its answer to Drago‟s complaint and insisted that the matter proceed to arbitration, thereby removing the issue from contention. Faced with a mountain of uncertainty, the options available to the trial justice were few, and she concluded that a remand was the proper means of addressing this problem. Although we reject the trial justice‟s decision with respect to a court‟s inherent authority to remand an arbitration award, we similarly are hard pressed to fault Drago for failing to introduce the bond—and to permit IFIC to capitalize on this omission—when IFIC conceded that it was on the bond.', '- 10 - 37-16-19, we affirm the judgment below, but do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice.6', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

In support of his argument, he contends that the affidavit not only failed to establish a nexus between the alleged unlawful conduct and his home, but also that the confidential informant (CI), upon whom the affiant depended, was not reliable and had no established basis of knowledge nor sufficient veracity to justify issuing a search warrant for the defendant’s residence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On July 27, 2007, David Silva, a narcotics detective for the Pawtucket Police Department, executed a search warrant at defendant’s residence, located at 111 Freight Street,', '-1- Apartment 4, in the City of Pawtucket. 1 A search of the apartment produced the following evidence: Under defendant’s bed was an unlocked, metal safe that contained 1.10 ounces (31.29 grams) of cocaine packaged in a clear plastic bag, a black digital scale, a box of plastic sandwich bags, a calculator, two bottles of super inositol, 2 scissors, two cell phones, 3 defendant’s personal papers, and $718 in cash. In defendant’s bedroom closet was a gray metal safe containing more of defendant’s personal papers, including various bills, a Social Security card, a resident alien card, tax information, and various pieces of mail.', 'Also, defendant’s driver’s license was discovered on a bedroom bureau.', 'The defendant was subsequently charged by information with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver (count 1), possession of cocaine in an amount between one ounce and one kilogram (count 2), distributing and/or manufacturing cocaine within three hundred yards of a school (count 3), and maintaining a narcotics nuisance (count 4). 4 Before the trial commenced, defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his residence, alleging that the warrant failed to establish probable cause to justify the search of the apartment because there was “no nexus between the controlled buy described in the search warrant affidavit and the premises searched.”', 'At a hearing on May 12, 2009, Det.

Silva do not establish probable cause since “[t]here are no specific allegations, or particularized information based on police surveillance, that the defendant [was] likely to keep drugs or drug paraphernalia in his home.” Moreover, although recognizing that direct evidence is not necessary for a magistrate to find probable cause, defendant avers that “the affidavit in this case is devoid of even the more general information [that c]ourts have turned to” to establish a nexus “between a defendant’s drug dealing and [his or her] home.” Lastly, he postulates that the mere fact that a person is believed 7', 'The defendant further argues that the “good faith” exception to search warrants, as promulgated in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 913-17 (1984), does not appy to his appeal. However, we need not reach this argument because we hold that the affidavit in this case does establish the requisite probable cause for the warrant at issue.', '-5- to be a drug dealer, without more, does not furnish probable cause to expect that drugs would be found in his or her home.', 'The defendant cites State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 737 (R.I. 1994), to support his contention that the affidavit in his case lacked probable cause. He argues that probable cause was established there because “the informant lived in the same residence as the defendant and packaged and purchased drugs there,” but that, in his case, the police did not observe defendant “in or near his residence,” nor was his vehicle connected to his home. Therefore, according to defendant, probable cause to search his residence was lacking. He also attempts to distinguish his case from State v. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d 89, 96, 97 (R.I. 2005), in which a CI gave the police an exact location of where the illegal contraband was being stored, as well as the defendant’s telephone number, which was used to call the defendant and complete an undercover buy. According to defendant, the police in Verrecchia made direct observations that verified the CI’s tip and “established facts by which a magistrate could infer that evidence of contraband was likely to be located in [the place where the CI reported that it was being stored].” The defendant states, in his brief, that:', '“In stark contrast to the careful and diligent police investigation in', 'State v. Verrecchia, the * * * police detectives in [defendant’s]', 'case reported no surveillance, monitoring, or any police legwork', 'that resulted in facts by which a reviewing court might infer a', 'nexus existed between [defendant’s] alleged vehicle drug dealing', 'and his home.”', 'Further, defendant attempts to distinguish his case from both United States v. Barnes, 492 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2007), and United States v. Angulo-Lopez, 791 F.2d 1394, 1398, 1399 (9th Cir. 1986) (both holding that there was a nexus between the drug dealing activity and the defendants’ homes from which they had been observed leaving)—cases that the trial justice relied upon in finding that probable cause existed within the affidavit. The defendant argues that', '-6- the trial justice based his denial of defendant’s motion to suppress “on a statement borrowed from case law rather than on an examination of the evidence[—]and lack of evidence[—]in the affidavit before him.” The defendant contends that “the Barnes Court arrived by deduction at its conclusion after a logical and inferential examination of the facts present in the affidavit,” whereas the trial justice in this case merely “relied upon the bare conclusion that street level drug dealers store their wares in their homes.” He posits that the affidavit in his case is different from the one in Barnes because', '“[t]he informant [here], unlike the Barnes informant, did not', 'observe drugs inside the residence, or profess familiarity with the', 'inside of the residence, or even describe [defendant] by name, or', 'provide details or description of [defendant’s] car. No reports', 'were made in the affidavit that [defendant] was observed outside of', 'the residence, or that he left the residence directly before selling', 'drugs, or that drug paraphernalia or residue was discovered [near', 'his residence], or that the extent of his drug dealing was such that', 'the accumulation of proceeds would demand a safe and accessible', 'hiding place.”', 'The state counters that probable cause was properly established within the four corners of the affidavit and that the trial justice did not err in his determination that the search warrant was valid. The state, quoting United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 87-88 (1st Cir. 1999), argues:', '“[I]t is absurd to believe that an individual who deals drugs from', 'his car is storing his entire supply, along with the requisite records', 'and paraphernalia, in the vehicle; instead, it is entirely logical to', 'infer that such contraband and the accompanying evidence will be', 'found in a ‘safe yet accessible place,’ namely, the suspect’s home.”', '“The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6, of the Rhode Island Constitution, prohibit the issuance of a search warrant absent a showing of probable cause.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 637 (quoting Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94). “Probable cause must be ascertained within the four corners of the affidavit prepared in support of the warrant', '-7- * * * and based on the totality of the circumstances presented in the affidavit.” Id. at 638. “In making this determination, the issuing magistrate must review the affidavit and, based on the facts contained therein, together with the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts, make a practical, commonsense determination as to whether ‘there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.’” Id. (quoting Illinois v.

Anthony, 883 N.E.2d 918, 926 (Mass. 2008)). The defendant, quoting Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641, however, attempts to distinguish his drug-dealing case from Byrne, a video voyeurism case, by stating that, “[u]nlike drug dealing which often takes place in public on the open street and often involves multiple public interactions between various individuals, child pornography is by its very nature ‘a solitary and secretive crime.’” He further contends that “[g]iven the public, recurring, and non-solitary character of drug dealing, the ‘nature of the crime’ analysis which guided th[is] Court in Byrne is inapplicable to the facts of this case.”', 'The trial justice stated:', '-8-', '“The fact that in [Barnes and Angulo-Lopez] there is a', 'distinguishing factor that the defendant was seen coming from the', 'residence does not necessarily mean in all instances the suspect has', 'to have come from the residence in order to raise antennae in the', 'eyes of the experienced police officer, particularly where an', 'informant was proven to be reliable, as the informant here was.', '“* * * The [Barnes] Court goes on to say, ‘This Court has', 'repeatedly found, however, that when a defendant sells drugs', 'outside his home, it is reasonable to conclude that there is evidence', 'of this drug dealing activity in the home.’ * * *', '“Although that factor is absent in the instant case, that', 'language is nonetheless instructive, as is the language in the', 'Angulo[-Lopez] case * * *.

Drugs must be stored and secreted, and we are of the opinion that the trial justice made a reasonable inference when he stated “that a drug dealer keeps his narcotics and * * * the paraphernalia for packaging for sale of such narcotics[] secreted in his residence.” Here, the affidavit explicitly states that the CI reported the distribution of cocaine by a black male from 111 Freight Street, Apartment 4 in Pawtucket. The police then investigated and determined that the male described was defendant and that defendant resided at that address.', 'Although not stating that the police directly observed defendant enter and exit this apartment to go sell drugs from his vehicle, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances presented within the affidavit was sufficient to enable the magistrate to reasonably infer that illegal contraband would be found in defendant’s residence.

Moreover, defendant alleges that “the use of an informant to conduct a controlled buy does not solve the affidavit’s deficiencies because the confidential informant who participated in the controlled buy appears, again, to lack any indicia of reliability.” Additionally, he contends that, because the affidavit did not state the date that the CI provided the tip, the information provided by the CI should be considered stale, and therefore, deficient as a basis upon which to make a probable cause determination.', '“It is well settled that, under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, ‘an informant’s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge remain highly relevant.’” State v.

(quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 233). “The totality-of-the-circumstances approach also recognizes the probative value of the ‘corroboration of details of an informant’s tip by independent police work.’” Id. (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 241).', 'To determine a search warrant’s validity, “we examine whether there was ‘a substantial basis from which to discern probable cause’ from the ‘totality of the circumstances’ found within ‘the four corners of the affidavit prepared in support of the warrant.’” Storey, 8 A.3d at 461 (quoting Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638). “Although each piece of information may not alone be', '- 10 - sufficient to establish probable cause * * *, ‘probable cause is the sum total of layers of information and the synthesis of what the police have heard, what they know, and what they observed as trained officers.’” Id. at 462 (quoting State v.

A police investigation ensued, which revealed that the “black male” was defendant and that defendant did live at the address provided by the informant. Further, Det. Silva observed defendant driving around, making short stops with different people at different, discreet locations, primarily at night, which the detective stated was “consistent with street level distribution of narcotics.”', 'Although defendant argues that the detective’s observations “seem[] to disprove the [CI’s] tip – i.e. showed no evidence of any drug dealing from 111 Freight Street,” we are satisfied that the detective’s observations supported the CI’s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge because they confirmed that defendant probably was selling drugs, as was alleged by the CI in the original tip.', 'The CI’s tip, however, is not the only evidence of defendant’s drug activity within the affidavit that the magistrate had before him when he made his probable-cause determination. The affidavit states that the detective also set up a controlled buy, which resulted in the observation of defendant selling cocaine directly to the CI. Whether the person involved in the controlled buy was the same person who provided the initial tip to the police is irrelevant to the finding of probable cause. As the trial justice stated:', '“If it’s the same informant, so much the better for the State,', 'because a controlled buy was accomplished.

And, I think it is a fair inference to be drawn', 'that a drug dealer keeps his narcotics and indeed the paraphernalia', 'for packaging for sale of such narcotics, secreted in his residence.” We perceive no error in the trial justice’s determination that the CI’s tip was properly corroborated or that this corroborated tip, combined with defendant’s recent sale of cocaine in a controlled buy, satisfied the probable cause requirement to support the warrant which authorized the search of defendant’s residence.', 'Additionally, the defendant’s argument that the undated tip presented “the possibility that the information received by the Detective was stale by the time the cursory investigation began” is unavailing. The affidavit states that the controlled buy, in which the defendant directly was observed by the police selling cocaine to the confidential informant, took place on a date between July 21, 2007, and July 27, 2007. The warrant was authorized, issued, and executed on July 27, 2007. In Storey, 8 A.3d at 462, we held that “the combination of an older tip, plus fresh evidence discovered close in time to the warrant application was sufficient to show that the tip was not stale and to establish probable cause.” Even assuming the initial tip had withered, it obtained new growth when the police observed the defendant selling cocaine to the CI within one week of the application for the warrant. As such, we are satisfied that the recent controlled buy obviated any concern about the timeliness of the initial tip.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, James LaPierre, 1 appeals from a judgment of conviction of three counts of first-degree child molestation and three counts of second-degree child molestation. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial was clearly erroneous because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice. Specifically, he argues that the testimony of the complaining witness was “so characterized by vagueness, illogic, inconsistency, and lack of recall that she was simply incredible.” For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The defendant met the complaining witness’s mother, Susan, 2 around March 1996, and the two began dating shortly thereafter. At some point during the summer of that same year, 1', 'The defendant legally changed his name to Miguel Monti in 1991.

Jane, the complaining witness in this case, was the oldest of the three and the only girl. At that time, Jane was seven years old and the family lived at an apartment located on Atwells Avenue in the City of Providence.', 'Eventually, defendant began babysitting Susan’s children while she was working. In the fall of 1997, after becoming pregnant with defendant’s child, Susan and her children moved to Palfrey Place in Providence, at which time Jane was approximately eight years old. After the couple’s baby was born, Susan returned to work and defendant resumed babysitting on those nights.', 'At trial, Susan testified that when Jane was either eight or nine years old, Jane informed her that defendant had “touched her butt.” 3 Susan further testified that she confronted defendant about her daughter’s comment, and he denied it. Later that day or the next day, Jane expressed to her mother that she had lied and that the alleged touching had not occurred. Jane testified at trial that between the initial disclosure to her mother and her subsequent recantation, she had spoken with defendant and he had “asked [her] not to tell her [mother]” or he would “[d]rag [them] through the mud.” Jane testified that defendant’s threat scared her, so she went back and told her mom that it never happened. Susan attested that, after her daughter’s revelation, she “watch[ed] for little thing[s],” but admitted that there were a number of times that she allowed her daughter to be alone with defendant notwithstanding the disclosure and her concerns that arose from it.', 'In October 2000, defendant and Susan ended their dating relationship, but defendant continued to see their son on a daily basis. The next month, defendant began dating Kelly, a friend of Susan’s, with whom he later cohabitated. 4 In February 2005, however, defendant 3', 'During a grand jury proceeding held in 2005, Susan testified that Jane was either five or six years old at the time of this disclosure. 4', 'Kelly had a daughter who also lived with them.', '-2- moved out of Kelly’s residence to Aqueduct Road in the City of Cranston. The defendant continued to provide care for his son five days per week, so he discussed his need for a babysitter during those times with Susan, and she suggested that Jane babysit. The defendant testified that Jane babysat at his house “roughly” twenty-five to thirty times between February and April of 2005, and that she would sleep over on the nights she was there.', 'When Jane was in seventh grade, she became best friends with her classmate, Andrea. 5 Jane testified that she told Andrea about what defendant did with her when she was younger after finding Andrea “in the science room on the floor crying.” 6 Jane stated:', '“I had asked [Andrea] what was wrong, and she kind of like lashed', 'out on me and said that I wouldn’t understand.

She was supposed to babysit at defendant’s house that night, so she asked the church’s bus driver to drop her off at Aqueduct Road rather than at her own address.

The defendant testified that after he left his apartment, he saw “a very large amount of kids outside” who were making “a lot of noise and ruckus.” He stated that he heard them shouting, “That’s the one who raped her” and that they started running toward him. In response to this situation, defendant testified that he got into his truck and drove away. The defendant attested that he called his home telephone, that Jane answered it, and that she told him that she did not tell anyone that he had raped her, but stated that Andrea “had said something to the people on the bus.”', 'A female officer questioned Jane, asking “[i]f what everyone was saying was the truth.” Jane testified that, at first, she told the officer that the allegations were a lie and that defendant had not done anything to her; but, after being told by the officer that she would get into trouble if 7', 'The defendant denied that this conversation occurred and testified that their discussion revolved around why she was so late getting to his apartment as well as babysitting instructions. 8', 'The defendant asserted that “the [tele]phone never rang in the house.” 9', 'Although Jane testified that it was the “bus monitor” who called her, both the bus driver and Andrea testified that the bus driver was the only adult on the bus that night. 10', 'According to the bus driver, Jane had asked that night if she could be the last kid to get dropped off; and, when he denied her request, “[s]he was a little upset.” Subsequently, after leaving defendant’s address, the bus driver testified that he “hear[d] the buzzer to the door go off and all of the kids started jumping out of the back door of the bus.” Based on information provided to him by Andrea, the bus driver returned to defendant’s address.', '-4- she was lying, Jane admitted “the truth.” 11 Jane then was brought to the Cranston police department and later was joined by her mother. After leaving the police station, Susan and Jane both spoke with defendant on the telephone. According to Jane, when defendant spoke with her, “[h]e was begging [her] to say that there was no penetration.” She testified that defendant was crying and that there were loud noises, similar to “water crashing,” that she could hear in the background. Susan testified that defendant said to her that “he was a monster, and he was sorry” during this telephone conversation. 12', 'Kelly likewise testified that she spoke with defendant that night, asserting that “[h]e was hysterical” and crying during their conversation and that he said to her “that there was an incident where he * * * put baby powder on [Jane] * * * [but] that if he did something to her, he doesn’t remember.” Kelly further testified that defendant said that he was in a hotel “on the run” and that he wanted to kill himself. She stated that he continuously referred to himself as a “monster,” while exclaiming that “he couldn’t believe what he had done and that he felt bad and that he was sorry.”', 'A grand jury indicted defendant on four counts of first-degree child molestation, and he was arrested on May 24, 2005.

Thereafter, on January 2, 2008, a second grand jury indicted defendant on a total of six counts of child molestation, three of which were first-degree charges and three of which were second-degree charges. 14 A trial was held in February 2010.', 'At the trial, Jane testified that, after her family moved to Palfrey Place, defendant would babysit her and her two younger brothers approximately five or six nights out of the week while her mother worked. She recalled one particular night that defendant was babysitting, when, after sending her brothers to bed, defendant asked her to lie down on the couch with him, which she did. Jane stated that they were positioned with “[h]is back * * * against the couch and [her] back * * * against his chest,” and that this was the first time they had ever done this. 15 According to Jane, defendant then asked her “to play a game,” which eventually resulted in digital, vaginal penetration. She further testified that defendant told her to go to her mother’s bedroom where defendant performed cunnilingus on her. Jane stated that defendant would engage in “different 14', 'The six counts that defendant was indicted for included the engagement, with a person under the age of fourteen, in: (count 1) digital/vaginal penetration, (count 2) hand/inner thigh contact, (count 3) cunnilingus, (count 4) anal intercourse, (count 5) hand/buttocks contact, and (count 6) hand/penile contact. 15', 'As will be discussed infra, at the first grand jury hearing, Jane testified that she was six years old and was living at the Atwells Avenue apartment when defendant first sexually assaulted her. She further testified at the first grand jury hearing that “it also continued at Palfrey Place,” but that “[i]t happened more [at Atwells Avenue] than other places.” However, Jane’s testimony regarding how old she was changed between the first and second grand jury hearings based on her understanding of which apartment had a particular green rug. As Jane explained at the trial, she had “thought the green rug was in * * * Atwells [Avenue],” which is why she “mist[ook] [her] age.” Jane further testified that when she “realized that the green rug was on * * * Palfrey Place[,] [t]hat is how [she] came to the realization that [she] was much older than what [she] had said the first couple of times.” When Jane was questioned about how she came to this realization, she testified that she had “asked her [mother] where the green rug was, and [was told] that it was at * * * Palfrey [Place], * * * [and that] it happened the most where the green rug was.”', '-6- things [during] different time[s],” but that some type of sexual activity would happen “[e]very time [her] mom went to work and he babysat.”', 'Jane additionally testified about another specific instance that took place when she was nine years old. She stated that she had been sleeping in her mother’s bed when defendant woke her up by “rubbing baby powder * * * on [her] butt” and proceeded to perform anal intercourse. Although Jane “told him to stop” “[b]ecause it hurt,” he did not. Jane attested that she did not tell her mother about this event. The last detailed event Jane testified about was when defendant asked her to “unzip his pants” and “told [her] to touch him,” which she did.', 'According to Jane, when she was fourteen years old, she was walking to a local community pool when defendant stopped as he was driving by and “asked [her] if she wanted a ride.” Jane testified that she accepted the ride, but that defendant stopped by his apartment on the way to the pool to use the bathroom. Jane stated that, although she initially remained in the car, after a little while she also went into defendant’s apartment. She testified that when she arrived in the apartment, defendant told her that “[h]e wanted to teach [her] how to kiss.”16 She denied his request, and she testified that they went back to the car and he took her to the pool, but that she did not tell her mother about that occurrence.', 'Andrea testified that on the night of April 28, 2005, after Jane was dropped off from their youth-group church event, she “told the bus driver that [they] had to go back and get [her]” because of “something that [she] had learned during the private discussion [with Jane] and based on the feeling [that Jane] told [her] she was experiencing before [they] dropped her off.” 16', 'Jane provided inconsistent testimony about this incident. At the grand jury proceeding and at trial, Jane testified that she was walking to the Zucollo pool when defendant offered her a ride; however, during cross-examination, she stated that she had made a mistake and that she really had been heading toward the Neutaconkanut pool. Further, Jane testified at the first grand jury proceeding that defendant performed cunnilingus on her after she went upstairs to his apartment; however, at the trial, she attested that he merely told her that he wanted to kiss her.', '-7- According to Andrea, after the bus arrived back at defendant’s residence, she saw Jane, who seemed “[a]ngry, upset, sad, [and] confused.” Jane testified that she was angry at Andrea “[b]ecause she told a secret,” and Andrea stated that, “[a]fter the incident [they] actually didn’t speak” and that they “haven’t talked * * * in years.”', 'After the trial, the jury found defendant guilty on all six counts of child molestation. On May 3, 2010, defendant was sentenced to fifty years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), with twenty-five years to serve, twenty-five years suspended, with probation, on the three first-degree charges. The defendant also was sentenced to thirty years to serve at the ACI, with fifteen years to serve, fifteen years suspended, with probation, on the three second- degree charges, with all sentences to run concurrently.

Second,', '-9- defendant proposes that, although originally he was indicted on four counts, when it came to light on the eve of the first trial that Jane “had provided glaringly incorrect time periods for the dates of the alleged assaults,” she suddenly “revealed ‘new’ or ‘different’ incidents that she had not previously disclosed.” Third, defendant criticizes Jane’s sudden recognition of a “crucial fact that * * * she had never mentioned during the thirty months the case had been pending”: “the existence of a green rug in the apartment where she was assaulted * * * that allowed her to pinpoint the dates of the assaults.” Finally, he maintains that Jane’s “retelling of the ‘pool incident’ * * * [makes] little logical sense,” both with respect to her confusion between the names of two separate and distinct pools and the “starkly different versions” of events that Jane provided, while under oath, about what happened after she accepted defendant’s offer to give her a ride.', 'The state, quoting State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724 (R.I. 2011), argues that “defendant’s contentions [on appeal] lack merit” because “[t]he mere fact that defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” Id. at 738 (quoting State v.

Before this Court is a question of first impression. We are called upon to determine whether the Rhode Island Slayer’s Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 1.1 of title 33 (Slayer’s Act, or Act), prohibits the testatrix’s stepchildren, Jennifer and Jeremy Swain (plaintiffs), from inheriting as named contingent testamentary beneficiaries (contingent beneficiaries) because this inheritance would confer a benefit on their father, David Swain (David). David, a slayer pursuant to the Act, has been adjudicated responsible for intentionally causing the death of the testatrix, Shelley Arden Tyre (Shelley). 1', 'The plaintiffs appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant, Estate of Shelley A. Tyre (Estate or defendant), holding that they were barred as a matter of law from inheriting under the Slayer’s Act. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 20, 2012, 2 pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why 1', 'This Court means no disrespect to the parties by referring to them by their first names. It is for clarity purposes only that first names are used throughout this opinion. 2', 'The extended travel in this Court is discussed more fully below.', '-1- the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the record and considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The essential facts of this case are not in dispute. Shelley executed the will in question on October 5, 1993, in contemplation of her marriage to David. 3 She married David shortly thereafter. Her will named David as the sole beneficiary of her estate. She also specifically named both Jennifer and Jeremy Swain as the only contingent beneficiaries under her will. They stood to inherit in the event that David predeceased her. 4', 'Shelley’s untimely death by drowning in 1999 triggered the administration of her estate. 5 Pursuant to her will, David was named as the executor. However, this role was short-lived. On May 1, 2002, after first bringing a wrongful-death claim against David in the Newport County Superior Court, Shelley’s parents filed a petition in the Jamestown Probate Court to remove David as executor. The probate judge granted the petition on July 3, 2002, removed David as executor, and then appointed James H. Reilly (Reilly or administrator) 6 as the administrator 3', 'The Estate notes that Shelley and David also executed a prenuptial agreement on the same day that Shelley executed her will. Pursuant to the prenuptial agreement, neither Shelley nor David would have a right to either party’s assets or any alimony upon divorce. 4', 'Clause III of Shelley’s Last Will and Testament reads as follows: “I give all my tangible personal property to my husband, or if he is not living thirty (30) days after my death, then in substantially equal shares to such of my husband’s children, Jennifer Swain and Jeremy Swain (hereinafter ‘my husband’s children’), as are then living.” 5', 'On March 12, 1999, Shelley died while scuba diving with David off the coast of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. 6', 'James H. Reilly currently remains the administrator d.b.n., c.t.a., of Shelley’s estate.', '-2- d.b.n., c.t.a., of Shelley’s estate. Additionally, the probate judge ordered David to return the sum of $152,568.19, which the probate court deemed he had wrongfully taken from the estate. 7', 'As noted above, on March 5, 2002, Shelley’s parents brought a wrongful-death action against David alleging that he (1) was a slayer pursuant to § 33-1.1-1(3); (2) caused Shelley’s wrongful death; and (3) should be subject to civil liability for a criminal act, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-1-2. After a trial, held in February of 2006, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Shelley’s parents on all three counts, finding that David “intentionally * * * killed Shelley with malice aforethought” and that he therefore met the definition of slayer set forth in the Slayer’s Act. 8 Shelley’s parents were awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $2,815,085.46, as well as punitive damages totaling $2 million. After the trial justice denied his motion for a new trial, David appealed to this Court. On May 13, 2008, we affirmed the lower court ruling, holding that “once the Superior Court has made a declaration * * * with respect to whether a defendant is a slayer it is then within the province of the probate court to determine what effect, if any, that declaration has on the distribution of the decedent’s assets under a will or other instrument.” Tyre v. Swain, 946 A.2d 1189, 1198 (R.I. 2008).', 'Thereafter, on May 20, 2008, Reilly filed a petition in the Jamestown Probate Court to construe the will in light of this Court’s decision. 9 On June 27, 2008, the probate judge issued a written order declaring that “[n]either David A. Swain, nor his heirs at law, shall receive directly 7', 'This sum was never paid. As we note below, it was later discharged in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. 8', 'Section 33-1.1-1(3) states that a slayer is “any person who willfully and unlawfully takes or procures to be taken the life of another.” 9', 'Reilly previously had filed a petition with the probate court in 2006 after David was adjudged a slayer in the Superior Court. However, that petition was stayed pending David’s appeal to this Court.', '-3- or indirectly from the Estate of Shelley Arden Tyre.” Accordingly, based on that order, Jennifer and Jeremy were precluded from inheriting under Shelley’s will as contingent beneficiaries.', 'The plaintiffs timely appealed the probate order to the Newport County Superior Court, arguing that the Slayer’s Act did not bar them from taking their share under Shelley’s will. They contended that since they were specifically named as contingent beneficiaries, they therefore were not inheriting “through” their father, as would otherwise be prohibited by the Slayer’s Act. In opposition, the Estate maintained that allowing Jennifer and Jeremy to inherit would, in fact be, a benefit to David, in direct violation of the Slayer’s Act. 10 According to the Estate, the Legislature “intended both a broad interpretation and discretion to determine when a slayer will benefit by either taking directly or indirectly as a result of the death of the decedent.”', 'On cross-motions for summary judgment, the hearing justice found in favor of the Estate, holding that the Slayer’s Act barred Jennifer and Jeremy from inheriting under Shelley’s will. Referring to § 33-1.1-15, which prescribes that the Slayer’s Act be interpreted “broadly to effectuate the policy of this State that no person shall be allowed to profit from his or her wrongs,” the hearing justice determined that “allow[ing] Jennifer and Jeremy to take [under Shelley’s will]” would directly violate the Act because their inheritance would improperly allow “the slayer David Swain [to] profit from his wrongdoing.” Of import, the hearing justice noted that Jennifer and Jeremy were not minors, and therefore “ha[d] the ability to control the distribution of the property that * * * they would be entitled to if permitted by this action.” With that in mind, the hearing justice based his decision to bar plaintiffs’ taking under Shelley’s will on the undisputed facts that: (1) Jeremy had personally contributed and raised money to finance 10', 'Section 33-1.1-2 states that “[n]either the slayer nor any person claiming through him or her shall in any way acquire property or receive any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent * * *.”', '-4- his father’s defense; 11 and (2) Jennifer and Jeremy had both stated that they would use any proceeds they inherited from Shelley’s estate for their father’s criminal defense, if necessary.', 'The plaintiffs then filed a notice of appeal to this Court. 12 On appeal, they contend that the trial justice erred in determining that the bequest to Jennifer and Jeremy under Shelley’s will violated the Slayer’s Act. Furthermore, they maintain that the Slayer’s Act does not bar them from taking under Shelley’s will since they were specifically named as contingent beneficiaries and are therefore not “claiming through” David.', 'At the oral argument held on October 3, 2011, issues concerning mootness emerged. This Court deferred consideration of the merits of the appeal and issued an order directing the parties to file a joint statement as to whether the judgment of the Jamestown Probate Court (holding David responsible for paying the Estate $152,568.19) had been discharged in bankruptcy. Pursuant to our order, the parties submitted a joint statement confirming that the entire judgment had, in fact, been discharged in bankruptcy by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. In this joint statement, the parties also indicated that approximately $5,571.99 remained in the estate for distribution.', 'Thereafter, on October 21, 2011, we issued an order referring this matter to the Supreme Court Appellate Mediation Program for resolution. In the event that mediation failed, the order directed the parties to file additional briefs with this Court as to whether a justiciable controversy remained. 11', 'At the time, David was convicted of murder for Shelley’s death in the British Virgin Islands.

The notion that a person should not profit or benefit from his or her own wrong derives from the common law. The axiom was incorporated in the doctrines of attainder, forfeiture of estate, and corruption of blood. 15 See Tara L. Pehush, Maryland is Dying for a Slayer Statute: The Ineffectiveness of the Common Law Slayer Rule in Maryland, 35 U. Balt. L. Rev. 271 (2005); Karen J.

Together, these doctrines 15', '“Attainder” is “the act of extinguishing a person’s civil rights when sentenced to death or declared an outlaw for committing a felony or treason.” Black’s Law Dictionary 123 (7th ed. 1999). “Forfeiture” is “[t]he loss of a right, privilege, or property because of a crime, breach of obligation, or neglect of duty.” Id. at 661. “Corruption of blood” is a doctrine pursuant to which “a person loses the ability to inherit or pass property as a result of an attainder or of being declared civilly dead.” Id. at 348.', '-9- prohibited a slayer and his or her heirs from receiving property under the distribution of a victim’s estate.', 'The United States Constitution later substantially abolished these common-law doctrines; 16 however, the premise that no person shall benefit from his or her own wrongdoing endured.', 'In the late nineteenth century, the United States Supreme Court addressed the inheritance rights of a slayer and his issue. See New York Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Armstrong, 117 U.S. 591 (1886). In that case, an insurance company refused to pay the victim’s policy proceeds to the slayer’s estate, even though the victim’s policy explicitly stated that the policy proceeds were payable to the slayer. Relying on the maxim that no person shall benefit from his own wrong, the Court held that the slayer’s estate was barred from collecting the proceeds of the victim’s insurance policy, even though the estate’s beneficiaries consisted of potentially innocent heirs.

The Court stated:', '“[I]ndependently [sic] of any proof of the motives of [the slayer] in', 'obtaining the policy, and even assuming that they were just and', 'proper, he forfeited all rights under it when, to secure its', 'immediate payment, he murdered the assured.

A slayer is defined under the statute as “any person who willfully and unlawfully takes or procures to be taken the life of another.” Section 33-1.1-1(3). When the slayer is named as a beneficiary in the decedent’s will, “[t]he slayer shall be deemed to have predeceased the decedent as to property which would have passed to the slayer by devise or legacy from the decedent, except that the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 33-6-19 18 [the anti-lapse statute] shall not apply.” Section 33-1.1-4. Additionally, the Act precludes a slayer from inheriting an intestate or spousal share, thereby also precluding the slayer’s issue from such inheritance.

Thus, the slayer’s issue would be barred from inheriting in such fashion.', '-11- receiv[ing] any benefit as a result of the death of the decedent.” Section 33-1.1-2 (emphasis added). Here, it is clear that plaintiffs are not claiming through the slayer. Rather, they seek their share explicitly under the terms of Shelley’s will. They maintain that applying the Slayer’s Act to preclude their inheritance directly contravenes Shelley’s testamentary intent. They note that the Estate has never refuted plaintiffs’ assertion that Shelley valued her relationship with them and that they shared a strong familial bond.', 'Further, plaintiffs emphasize that there is no language in the Slayer’s Act specifically precluding a slayer’s issue from inheriting as named contingent beneficiaries. Thus, according to plaintiffs, the Slayer’s Act only applies to disinherit a slayer’s issue when they have not been named as beneficiaries in the decedent’s will. Additionally, they contend that the Legislature carefully drafted the Slayer’s Act to strike a balance between two competing interests: the interest in prohibiting a slayer from benefitting from his or her wrongs, and the interest in carrying out the wishes of testators under the terms of their wills. As such, then, the Slayer’s Act explicitly carves out language to preclude a slayer’s issue from inheriting under the anti-lapse statute or through intestacy, while otherwise allowing a slayer’s issue to inherit as named beneficiaries of the testator. Furthermore, plaintiffs contend that the Legislature did not intend to bar contingent beneficiaries from inheriting when such inheritance may only “indirectly” benefit a slayer.', 'The Estate maintains, however, that the broad language and construction of the Slayer’s Act bar plaintiffs from taking under Shelley’s will. The Act explicitly prohibits a slayer from “in any way acquir[ing] any property or receiv[ing] any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent * * *.” Section 33-1.1-2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the Act states that it “shall be', '-12- construed broadly in order to effect the policy of this state that no person shall be allowed to profit by his or her own wrong.” Section 33-1.1-15.', 'Therefore, the Estate argues, plaintiffs’ taking under Shelley’s will would directly contravene the Slayer’s Act by conferring a benefit on David. Since the Act does not define what a benefit is, the Estate cites various dictionary definitions, which all generally define “benefit” as an advantage or a gain. The Estate points out the undisputed facts that both Jennifer and Jeremy deny their father’s involvement in Shelley’s death.', 'Jeremy has contributed financially to his father’s criminal defense; and both siblings have stipulated that if they are successful in this appeal, they would use any assets obtained for their father’s defense, if necessary. Thus, the inclusion of the language precluding a slayer from benefiting “in any way,” together with the broad construction required by the Act, operates to bar plaintiffs from inheriting as contingent beneficiaries.', 'Additionally, the Estate maintains that, “it is clear that [Shelley’s] will was made without the benefit of knowing that [David] would kill her, and the legal fiction that he predeceased her, despite not being dead, would result in his children taking her estate.” Thus, the Estate asserts that, although Jennifer and Jeremy stood to inherit under Shelley’s will as contingent beneficiaries in the event that David predeceased her, she did not intend for them to inherit if David otherwise “predeceased” her by virtue of the Slayer’s Act.', 'D', 'Analysis', 'In reviewing the language of the Slayer’s Act, we repeat that a statute may not be construed in a way that “would defeat the underlying purpose of the enactment.” Brennan, 529', '-13- A.2d at 637. “[O]ur ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Webster, 774 A.2d at 75.', 'The Slayer’s Act explicitly states that it “shall be construed broadly in order to effect the policy of this state that no person shall be allowed to profit by his or her own wrong.” Section 33-1.1-15. 19 We consider this language mandating a broad construction of the Act to be crucial to our analysis. See Clark, 974 A.2d at 571 (“[T]he Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the [C]ourt will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.”). “[I]t is axiomatic that ‘this Court will not broaden statutory provisions by judicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the clear intent or defining the terms of the statute.’” Iselin, 943 A.2d at 1049-50 (quoting State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005) (emphasis added)). Here, the clear intent of the Slayer’s Act is to ensure that a slayer does not benefit from his or her wrongdoing. Thus, although the Slayer’s Act does not specifically include language barring the slayer’s issue from inheriting as contingent beneficiaries, the clear and unequivocal direction of the Act requires this Court, based on the facts before us, 20 to interpret it so as to prevent the slayer from benefitting.', 'Here, it is undisputed that David will benefit from murdering Shelley if Jennifer and Jeremy are allowed to inherit under her will. The plaintiffs have put on the record that they 19', 'The Act also states that it “shall not be considered penal in nature.” Section 33-1.1-15. Thus, the forfeiture under the will is not a punishment. Instead, it serves to reinforce the policy of this state that no person shall benefit from his or her own wrongdoing. 20', 'We acknowledge that there may be situations in which the Slayer’s Act does not apply to bar the slayer’s issue from inheriting as contingent testamentary beneficiaries. For example, in the situation of a murder-suicide, the slayer is no longer living to reap the benefit of his wrongdoing. Thus, the Slayer’s Act would not preclude the slayer’s issue from inheriting, since such inheritance would not confer any benefit on the slayer. Similarly, there might be a factual question as to whether estranged children of the slayer, also named as contingent testamentary beneficiaries, would use such inheritance to the slayer’s benefit.', '-14- would use any money from their share of the estate to finance their father’s defense, if necessary. 21 They vigorously maintain that their father was not involved in Shelley’s tragic death.', 'Further, although the probate judgment of $152,568.19 against David has been discharged in bankruptcy, the outstanding multimillion-dollar civil judgment in favor of Shelley’s parents remains against David for Shelley’s wrongful death.', 'It is foreseeable to conclude that plaintiffs would use assets obtained from Shelley’s estate to help relieve their father’s burden of satisfying this obligation.', 'Such a benefit to David would directly contravene both the language and the intent of the Slayer’s Act. Indeed, on the facts presented, allowing plaintiffs to inherit under Shelley’s will would allow David to obtain a benefit in direct contravention of the Act. Therefore, we hold that the Slayer’s Act bars plaintiffs from inheriting as contingent beneficiaries.', 'We pause to respond to the dissent’s suggestion that we have created a third category of prohibited beneficiaries not contemplated by the Slayer’s Act. We have done no such thing. As stated above, § 33-1.1-2 provides that, “[n]either the slayer nor any person claiming through him or her shall in any way acquire any property or receive any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent * * *.” Thus, the Act explicitly forbids a slayer from obtaining a benefit. Here, both plaintiffs have stated that they would use the assets to pay for their father’s defense, if necessary. Thus, on the facts presented, there is no question that David will obtain a benefit if plaintiffs are permitted to take under Shelley’s will—a result directly at odds with the express language of the Act. 21', 'We note that although David’s murder conviction has since been overturned, see supra, note 11, thereby nullifying the need for any additional funds to be spent on his criminal defense, plaintiffs have already contributed financially to their father’s defense. Therefore, any share they obtain from the estate could be reimbursement for money already spent for David’s benefit.', '-15-', 'The dissent concedes that the Slayer’s Act “shall be construed broadly,” in accordance with the Legislature’s intent. However, the dissent’s own analysis applies a narrow construction of the Act. Indeed, the dissent restricts the Act’s reach by concluding that it does not prohibit a slayer from receiving a benefit, provided that such benefit is “one step removed” from the death of the decedent. In so doing, the dissent ignores the explicit language of the Act which forbids a slayer from benefitting or acquiring property “in any way * * * as a result of the death of the decedent.” See § 33-1.1-2 (emphasis added). Thus, the dissent’s reading of the Slayer’s Act is incompatible with the Legislature’s mandate that the Act be construed broadly.', 'The dissent suggests that we have construed the Act “limitlessly” rather than broadly. We respectfully disagree with this characterization of our holding. As stated in footnote 20 of this opinion, we acknowledge that there may indeed be factual situations in which contingent beneficiaries will not confer a benefit on a slayer, and therefore are not precluded from inheriting. Noting this, we expressly limited our holding to the facts of this case, in which there is no dispute that the plaintiffs’ taking under Shelley’s will unquestionably would confer a benefit upon David, in direct contravention of the Slayer’s Act.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', 'Justice Robinson, with whom Justice Flaherty joins, dissenting.', 'After no small amount of reflection concerning this admittedly challenging case, we have concluded that we', '-16- must respectfully dissent. We are unable to agree with the majority that the Slayer Act requires so broad a reading as to nullify Ms. Tyre’s explicit testimonial intent.', 'As a general rule of statutory construction, “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute may not be construed or extended but must be applied literally.” Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 57 (R.I. 1980); see also Castelli v. Carcieri, 961 A.2d 277, 285 (R.I. 2008) (“It is not the proper role of the judiciary to bestow rights or to take them away.”); Pizza Hut of America, Inc. v. Pastore, 519 A.2d 592 (R.I. 1987).', 'There is no ambiguity in the statute at issue. General Laws 1956 § 33-1.1-2 provides in pertinent part: “Neither the slayer nor any person claiming through him or her shall in any way acquire any property or receive any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent * * * .” The statute forbids two groups from benefitting “as the result of the death of the decedent”: (1) “slayer[s];” and (2) “any person claiming through [a slayer].” Id. (emphasis added). First, the statute does not simply forbid a slayer from receiving a benefit. Instead, it forbids a slayer from receiving a benefit “as the result of the death of the decedent.” See id. (emphasis added). This occurs when a slayer takes under a will or by intestacy. This is simply not the case here. If Jennifer and Jeremy Swain were to take under a will and then transfer property to a slayer, the slayer would not receive that property “as the result of the death of the decedent.” Rather, the slayer would benefit as a result of Jennifer and Jeremy Swain’s disposal of their own property. That is clearly one step removed from the “death of the decedent.”', 'Second, the beneficiaries in this case (Jennifer Swain and Jeremy Swain) do not fall into either category of prohibited beneficiaries as described in the clear language of § 33-1.1-2. They certainly are not slayers, and neither are they claiming “through” the slayer (their father David', '-17- Swain). Instead, Ms. Tyre named David Swain’s children as specific beneficiaries in her will. It is noteworthy that the majority opinion concedes as much, expressly noting that “it is clear that plaintiffs are not claiming through the slayer.” (Emphasis added.) The provisions of § 33-1.1-2 simply do not apply.', 'Although the General Assembly’s mandate that the Slayer Act must be “construed broadly” 22 should certainly be respected, the word “broadly” is by no means a synonym of “limitlessly.” This Court has previously stated that “[i]t is not the function of the Court to add language to an otherwise clear and unambiguous enactment.” See State v. Fuller-Balletta, 996 A.2d 133, 143 (R.I. 2010); see also Little v. Conflict of Interest Commission, 121 R.I. 232, 237, 397 A.2d 884, 887 (1979). Moreover, a clause that reflects a legislative intent to apply a statute broadly “is not an invitation to apply [that statute] to new purposes that [the legislature] never intended.” See Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183 (1993). The majority’s holding creates just such a “new purpose[ ]” by adding to the statute a third category of prohibited beneficiaries—viz., those persons who might opt to use what has by devise or legacy become their own property in a way that would confer a benefit on the slayer. These beneficiaries fall outside the two categories of prohibited beneficiaries named by the General Assembly. Therefore, we believe that the majority’s holding departs from the plain and unambiguous language of § 33-1.1-2.', 'For these reasons, we respectfully dissent. 22', 'General Laws 1956 § 33-1.1-15 reads: “This chapter shall not be considered penal in nature, but shall be construed broadly in order to effect the policy of this state that no person shall be allowed to profit by his or her own wrong.”', '-18-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Jennifer Swain et al. v.

The defendant, John Ford, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction declaring him to be in violation of his probation and executing thirty months of his previously imposed suspended sentence. On appeal, the defendant argues that, at his violation hearing, the hearing justice erred in refusing to admit a letter written and sent to him by the state’s complaining witness. Additionally, the defendant asserts that the hearing justice improperly precluded testimony concerning past arguments between him and the complaining witness about the latter’s drug use and about whether the complaining witness had brought him drugs when he was in a drug-treatment program. Finally, the defendant avers that the hearing justice’s decision to credit the complaining witness’s testimony over his own was unsupported by the record and that, therefore, the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding a violation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In 2005, defendant entered pleas of nolo contendere to one count of possession of a stolen motor vehicle or parts and to one count of reckless driving. For the stolen motor vehicle count, defendant was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), consisting of eighteen months to serve and 102 months suspended, with probation. For the reckless-driving count, defendant was sentenced to one year at the ACI, which was suspended, with probation. The sentences were to run concurrently. 1', 'On October 27, 2010, while defendant was still on probation, he was arrested by the Warwick police because of a domestic-assault complaint initiated by Tina Bartholomew, defendant’s then-girlfriend. At some point during that evening, defendant also suffered an injury to his forehead, but the source of the injury is a point of dispute. The next day, the state filed a probation-violation report under Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2 At defendant’s violation hearing, Bartholomew and defendant offered conflicting testimony about the events that transpired that night.', 'Ms. Bartholomew testified that, after spending much of the afternoon and early evening of October 27 with defendant and her daughter at defendant’s apartment and after consuming 1', 'Subsequently, defendant was declared in violation of his probation and was ordered to serve an additional eighteen months at the ACI, with the remaining seventy-eight months suspended. 2', 'Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows:', '“The court shall not revoke probation or revoke a suspension of', 'sentence or impose a sentence previously deferred except after a', 'hearing at which the defendant shall be afforded the opportunity to', 'be present and apprised of the grounds on which such action is', 'proposed.

Bartholomew testified that defendant was not at the apartment when she returned, but that he returned a few minutes later, with “blood on his shirt, a fat lip, [and] scrapes.” She further stated that when she returned from walking her daughter out to her father’s car (he had come to pick her daughter up), defendant “c[a]me out of nowhere,” and “just snapped,” throwing her to the pavement outside the apartment and hitting her on her face and body. Bartholomew testified that, after he attacked her, defendant calmed down and fell asleep, at which point she went to the apartment upstairs to call 9-1-1. 3 Officers from the Warwick Police Department arrived a short time later, arrested defendant, photographed Bartholomew’s face, and took a short, written statement from her. At the hearing, the court admitted two photographs taken by police, and Bartholomew testified that they depicted abrasions and bruises on her face that had been caused by defendant’s assault.', 'During cross-examination of Bartholomew, defendant marked for identification the written statement given by Bartholomew to Warwick police describing the alleged assault. 4 Bartholomew testified that before giving her written statement to police, she told them orally what had occurred, and she also explained that she did not provide a more detailed account of the evening’s events in her written statement because she had only a third-grade education and, thus, had difficulty reading and writing. She denied striking defendant during the evening and asserted that after he was placed in the police car, defendant started banging his head and “rocking his head like a crazy man.” At the hearing, 3', 'Ms. Bartholomew explained that she used the telephone in the upstairs apartment because she apparently could not get access to an operational telephone in defendant’s apartment. 4', 'Ms. Bartholomew’s written statement consisted of the following:', '“[My daughter] went home and [defendant] started calling me all', 'names and than he hit me in mine nose it really hurt he hit me hard.', '[R]eally hard it hart bad, and he hit me in me head.

However, the hearing justice sustained the state’s objections to this testimony.', 'The defendant testified at the hearing to his version of events. He stated that on October 27, 2010, Bartholomew consumed about eight beers and that she “was acting very erratic.” He testified that Bartholomew left the apartment with her daughter at some point during the evening and that he fell asleep while she was gone. According to defendant, when Bartholomew returned to his apartment, she requested his assistance in procuring drugs for her, which he declined to do. 5 Although the hearing justice prevented defendant from testifying about past arguments between defendant and Bartholomew about her drug use, he did permit testimony from defendant that, after he refused to assist Bartholomew in procuring drugs on October 27, she told him that she would get them from a friend, causing the dispute to escalate. According to defendant, during this dispute, Bartholomew hit him in the head with a bottle, causing a laceration to his forehead that required seven stiches. He testified that he responded by locking Bartholomew out of the apartment and that then he put a paper towel on his wound and went to bed. The defendant attested that he later was awakened by police and taken to Kent Hospital for treatment of his forehead injury before going to the police station. He testified that he did not hit Bartholomew on the evening in question, and he opined that the apparent abrasions to her face captured by the photographs may have been caused by a fall or by acne. The defendant further suggested that Bartholomew’s injuries were inconsistent with her description of the events, 5', 'The defendant explained that he did not support Bartholomew’s drug use because, at the time, he believed her to be pregnant with his child.', '-4- explaining: “I’m not like a weak guy. I have means, and if I were to punch her in the nose, she would have to have her nose fixed, guarantee that.”', 'The defendant also attempted to introduce an eight-page, handwritten letter from Bartholomew that she sent him after his arrest in which she professed loving feelings towards him and expressed her desire to share a life with him. At the hearing, he argued that the letter was admissible both to show that Bartholomew’s reading and writing skills exceeded her own representations, casting doubt on the veracity of her statement to police, and to contradict Bartholomew’s in-court statements about her relationship with defendant. The hearing justice refused to admit the letter after clarifying with defendant that he was “not * * * offering it for the truth of the matter asserted,” but rather “to impeach [Bartholomew’s] credibility based on the fact that she said she couldn’t write, and that she could, in fact, write.” 6 6', 'Although defense counsel initially offered a dual rationale for introducing the letter, when pushed by the hearing justice, he clarified that he sought to introduce the evidence for impeachment purposes:', '“[Hearing Justice]: So the purpose of introducing -- are you', 'limiting the purpose of the letter?', '“[Defendant]: That would be one reason.', '“[Hearing Justice]: * * * [Y]ou want it for the purpose to', 'show that the complaining witness could, in fact, write?', '“[Defendant]: One reason, and then also the context, which', '--', '“[Hearing Justice]: Does the context at all relate to the', 'allegations that --', '“[Defendant]: As an offer of proof, Judge, I think [the state]', 'would agree, we both had a chance to review the letter, the letter', 'makes no specific reference to, you know, the incident at all.

The state counters that even if the letter were substantively relevant, defendant’s final proffered objection to its exclusion at the hearing was that it was admissible for impeachment, not substantive purposes, triggering the raise-or-waive rule concerning this new argument. Additionally, the state argues that the decision to exclude the letter for impeachment purposes was within the sound discretion of the hearing justice.', '-8-', 'As to defendant’s latter argument—that the hearing justice abused his discretion in excluding the letter for impeachment purposes—we note the well-established principle that the decisions of the hearing justice “concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)).', 'Here, the record demonstrates that the hearing justice considered, and even clarified, defendant’s argument about admissibility, then excluded the letter from evidence. Although the hearing justice did not explicitly state his reasoning, it is evident from the record that he concluded the letter was not relevant to impeach Bartholomew’s testimony. 9 In our opinion, the hearing justice may well have concluded that the letter was irrelevant for impeachment purposes because it did not actually undermine Bartholomew’s earlier testimony. While Bartholomew’s letter was certainly longer than her written statement to police, the letter’s vocabulary, spelling, and grammar are generally consistent with her police statement; and, overall, the letter does not clearly undermine her testimony about her reading and writing abilities. Thus, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in excluding the letter for impeachment purposes.', 'Concerning the first of defendant’s arguments—that the evidence was substantively relevant to demonstrate the tone and nature of the relationship between defendant and Bartholomew—we conclude that the raise-or-waive rule precludes our consideration. “As this Court has made clear, the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on 9', 'The state initially objected on the grounds of both hearsay and relevance.

Under this principle, a litigant must make a timely and appropriate objection at trial, and the “assignments of error must be alleged with sufficient particularity so it will call the trial justice’s attention to the basis of the objection.” State v. Grant, 840 A.2d 541, 546-47 (R.I. 2004). The hearing justice specifically asked for clarification about the letter’s evidentiary purpose, and defendant ultimately conceded that he sought to introduce the letter only to impeach Bartholomew’s testimony about her reading and writing abilities. 10', 'We, therefore, conclude that by cabining the hearing justice’s consideration of the evidence to impeachment only, defendant waived his argument as to its substantive relevance for appeal.', 'Moreover, even were we not to apply the raise-or-waive rule in this instance, we would conclude nonetheless that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in excluding the letter for substantive purposes as irrelevant to the material issues at the violation hearing.', 'The defendant acknowledged at the hearing that there are no specific references in the letter to the events of October 27, 2010, but he now argues that the letter nevertheless is substantively relevant because it indicates Bartholomew’s remorse about the events of that evening and undermines the claims that she made about the couple’s relationship.', 'Given the tenuous 10', 'At oral arguments before this Court, defendant posited that, when he responded “Yes” to the hearing justice’s question “You’re offering [the letter] to impeach the credibility based on the fact that she said she couldn’t write and that she could, in fact, write?,” he actually meant that impeachment was but one basis for admission, and thus he did not waive his argument that the letter was also relevant for substantive purposes as a prior inconsistent statement.

Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987).

In making these arguments, defendant relies on language from this Court’s opinion in State v. Chartier, 619 A.2d 1119, 1122-23 (R.I. 1993), where we explained that a defendant’s prior wrongful or criminal acts are admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence when those prior acts are “interwoven with the offense for which the defendant is being tried.” The state responds that although the hearing justice precluded testimony about unrelated past incidents, he did permit similar testimony about Bartholomew’s alleged attempts to obtain drugs on the night in question.', 'The situation here is readily distinguishable from that in Chartier. There, the defendant allegedly had participated in a string of attempted and completed robberies over the course of a single evening, but was tried in connection with only two of the three incidents. Chartier, 619 A.2d at 1121-22. The defendant there sought to exclude all evidence pertaining to the uncharged incident, but the trial court denied this request, reasoning that, under Rule 404(b), the circumstances surrounding the uncharged incident tended to show the defendant’s knowledge of his confederates’ plans—an issue that was directly material to the charges levied against him.', '- 11 - Chartier, 619 A.2d at 1122-23. This Court affirmed, noting that, notwithstanding Rule 404(b)’s general prohibition of evidence of other crimes or bad acts, “other acts and conduct of the defendant at different times may be admissible at trial when they are interwoven with the offense for which the defendant is being tried * * *.” Chartier, 619 A.2d at 1122-23.', 'In contrast, here, drug purchases and arguments that allegedly occurred in the days, weeks, or months before the events in question are not directly relevant to any material issue. Moreover, the hearing justice did permit testimony about Bartholomew’s alleged attempts to obtain drugs on October 27, 2010—evidence that would tend to support defendant’s assertions that the couple quarreled. We conclude, therefore, that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in limiting this testimony.', 'C', 'Sufficiency of Evidence', 'The defendant’s final argument is that the hearing justice’s decision to credit Ms. Bartholomew’s testimony over his own amounts to arbitrary and capricious fact-finding. In probation-violation proceedings, “the state need only show that reasonably satisfactory evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.” English, 21 A.3d at 407 (quoting Bouffard, 945 A.2d at 310). The hearing justice noted that his conclusion in this case hinged largely on which witness’s testimony he found to be more credible. We again note that “[t]his Court gives the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses ‘great deference,’” id. at 407 (quoting Christodal, 946 A.2d at 816), and we “will not ‘second-guess’ supportable credibility assessments of a hearing justice in a probation-revocation hearing.” Jackson, 966 A.2d at 1229 (quoting Johnson, 899 A.2d at 482). We will not upset the finding of the hearing justice, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand, that Bartholomew provided a', '- 12 - more credible version of the events of October 27, 2010, which was further corroborated by photographic evidence. After carefully reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

112,: v. : David Fiore.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. David Fiore (defendant) appeals pro se from a Family Court order dismissing his motion for the return of certain personal property and also denying and dismissing his motion entitled, “[defendant’s motion for duty of state courts to hear federal question(s)].” Fiore contends that the Family Court clerk’s office “failed to perform a fiduciary duty” by not docketing a motion and a “[l]etter of appeal” that he filed “while he was in [f]ederal custody serving a prison sentence,” which he avers constitutes a due process violation with respect to the right of “access to the court.” This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Mr. Fiore and plaintiff Christine (Richards) Gough 1 were married on January 13, 2001, and they have one child, a daughter. The couple separated on or about January 30, 2001, when Fiore was incarcerated in a federal penitentiary for an eight-year sentence for drug trafficking. On March 1, 2006, Gough filed a complaint for divorce. On June 21, 2006, she was granted a divorce, which became final on October 10, 2006. In the final decree, Gough was awarded sole custody of the couple’s daughter, as well as all personal property in her possession, except a pair of diamond earrings, a painting of Roger Williams, and an oval table, which was awarded to Fiore.', 'The defendant was awarded personal property then being stored at Gough’s maternal grandmother’s house.', 'In a motion dated June 26, 2006, Fiore requested an evaluation of his daughter “[concerning what she wants for visitation with her father].” Although this motion was date- stamped as received by the court on June 29, 2006, it was not entered on the court docket sheet, nor did defendant schedule it for a hearing. By letter dated June 23, 2006, Fiore requested the Family Court clerk to “forward any papers available regarding the procedure to appeal the judgement [sic] of divorce.” This letter was date-stamped as received on July 11, 2006, but it also was not docketed. In another letter filed with the clerk on July 11, 2006, but again not docketed, defendant objected to plaintiff’s proposed decision pending entry of final judgment and moved to stay the decision. On July 18, 2006, however, Fiore filed a motion to withdraw his objection to entry of the judgment of divorce, stating that his earlier motion was “written out of emotion” rather than logic. 1', 'The record indicates that plaintiff is remarried. Accordingly, we shall refer to her by the name of Christine Gough.', '-2-', 'In February 2010, shortly after his release from prison, Fiore filed a motion for visitation entitled “[motion for access to child].” In reply, Gough filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that because she and her daughter had been living in Maryland for more than three years, Rhode Island was an inconvenient forum and Maryland would be the proper venue to determine visitation. After a hearing on April 13, 2010, the hearing justice dismissed Fiore’s motion under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 14.1 of title 15 (UCCJEA), specifically § 15-14.1-19, contingent upon Gough’s filing an affidavit that she had resided in Maryland for a period in excess of six months. On May 3, 2010, plaintiff filed an affidavit attesting that she and the parties’ daughter had resided in Maryland since July 2006. The defendant moved for reconsideration, and on August 3, 2010, the hearing justice denied reconsideration, stating that the Family Court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.', 'On November 19, 2010, Fiore filed two motions that are the subject of the instant appeal: a motion for the return of missing property and a motion entitled “[duty of state courts to hear federal question(s)]” (federal question motion).', 'Fiore also demanded a jury trial on these motions. At a hearing on February 4, 2011, Gough turned over the pair of diamond earrings that purportedly were awarded to Fiore in the divorce decree, and the hearing justice then dismissed the motion for the return of missing property and denied and dismissed the federal question motion.', 'The plaintiff submitted a proposed order after the decision, to which Fiore objected, saying that after the February 4 hearing, he had the diamond earrings examined by a jeweler “and had him document what type of diamond earrings” Gough had provided. Fiore asserted that Gough had given him the wrong earrings, and additionally argued that the proposed order incorrectly stated that his motion for the return of missing property was dismissed with', '-3- prejudice; rather, he contended, it should have been dismissed without prejudice. On April 29, 2011, Fiore filed a “[letter of record]” with the court, documenting his return of the diamond earrings to Gough via certified mail and asserting that they were “not the diamond earrings of [r]ecord.”', 'At the hearing on June 1, 2011, on Fiore’s objection to the proposed order, the hearing justice noted that, according to his recollection, at the earlier hearing, Fiore “at first, did not want to take [the earrings],” but that Fiore finally had said, “All right. I’ll take them. I’ll let it go.” Fiore, reading from the February 4 transcript, recalled the hearing justice’s previous statement that: “It seems to me, it would make sense that you accept [the diamond earrings]. And if they are not the right ones, you bring it to my attention.” The hearing justice also pointed out that Fiore had stated at the earlier hearing that he did not want to waste the court’s time and that he was just going to leave and go to Federal Court. Fiore agreed with the hearing justice’s recollection, and explained that the absence of a jury trial in Family Court was his reason for withdrawing his motion.', 'The hearing justice recessed the hearing to review the full transcript of the February 4 hearing, after which he approved the proposed order dismissing defendant’s motion with prejudice, stating “I think the proposed order as presented by [Gough] reflects what happened that day.” An order to that effect was entered on June 1, 2011, dismissing the motion for return of missing property with prejudice, noting that plaintiff had returned “a certain set of diamond earrings” and denying and dismissing the federal question motion. Fiore filed a notice of appeal that same day.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court will “apply a de novo standard of review * * * to questions of law, as well as to mixed questions of fact and law that purportedly implicate a constitutional right.” State v. Wiggins, 919 A.2d 987, 989 (R.I. 2007).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Mr. Fiore challenges both the hearing justice’s denial of his federal question motion and the denial of his motion for return of missing property.', 'A', 'Federal Question Motion', 'The defendant argues that the Family Court’s failure to docket both his June 2006 motion for evaluation of his daughter and his July 23, 2006 “[l]etter of appeal” constitutes “a due process violation of Fiore’s right of access to the [c]ourt.” Thus, Fiore contends that the hearing justice wrongfully denied his federal question motion on February 4, 2011. We perceive no merit to defendant’s contention that the clerk’s failure to docket his “[l]etter of appeal” resulted in a deprivation of due process. Clearly, that letter, addressed to the principal supervisory clerk of the Family Court, requesting her to “[p]lease forward any papers available regarding the procedure to appeal the judgment of divorce” cannot be construed as a valid notice of appeal. Moreover, defendant neither tendered a filing fee nor did he file a petition seeking relief from payment of the filing fee for reason of indigency, as required by Article I, Rule 5(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Significantly, shortly after filing the “[l]etter of appeal,” Fiore filed another document stating that he no longer was contesting the entry of final', '-5- judgment in his divorce, thus effectively abandoning any intention he may have had to file an appeal. Accordingly, this issue undeniably is without merit.', 'With respect to the aspect of his federal question motion alleging a constitutional violation due to the court clerk’s failure to docket his June 2006 motion for an evaluation of his daughter, defendant submits:', '“That upon the return to the date of the due process violation Fiore', 'will recover the right of the third party evaluation, with the', 'jurisdiction of the child remaining in the State of Rhode Island as', 'the Family Court must return to the date of the due process', 'violation and provide Fiore with a new divorce trial hearing, as all', 'orders provided after the due process violation will be considered', 'moot.”', 'We first note that even if the Court were to find a due process violation for failure to docket defendant’s motion for an evaluation, which we do not, such a violation would not turn back the clock to June 2006 and entitle defendant to a new divorce trial. Second, the record is silent about whether Fiore ever attempted to schedule a hearing on the motion. We recognize the difficulties inherent for a pro se litigant who is incarcerated out of state. Nevertheless, as defendant acknowledged in his pleadings, arrangements were made for him to appear by telephone at his divorce trial. Here, there is no suggestion in the record that defendant ever attempted to place his motion on the court calendar for a hearing. 2 Before a litigant seeking affirmative relief may allege a denial of due process, he or she first must attempt to engage whatever process he or she contends is due. See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 378 (1971) (noting that due process requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard, but that the 2', 'Mr. Fiore did send a letter to the Kent County Family Court clerk dated December 14, 2006, indicating that he never had received a ruling on the motion and requesting “the status of this pending motion.” Rule 6(c) of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations requires that “[a] written motion, other than one which may be heard ex parte, and notice of the hearing thereof shall be served not later than five days * * * before the time specified for the hearing * * *.” (Emphasis added).', '-6- “formality and procedural requisites” can vary, and further stating that “[d]ue process does not, of course, require that the defendant in every civil case actually have a hearing on the merits,” observing that “[a] State, can, for example, enter a default judgment against a defendant who, after adequate notice, fails to make a timely appearance * * * or who, without justifiable excuse, violates a procedural rule”). More significantly, however, the hearing justice dismissed Fiore’s “[motion for access to child]” after a hearing on April 13, 2010, ruling that Rhode Island was an inconvenient forum.', 'Although Fiore sought reconsideration of that matter, he did not appeal from either the order dismissing his motion for visitation or from the order denying reconsideration thereof. 3', 'Under the UCCJEA, “[a] court of this state which has jurisdiction * * * to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum * * * and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.” Section 15-14.1-19(a). In determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, the court considers several factors, including: “[t]he length of time the child has resided outside this state,” “[t]he distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction” and the “location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child.” Section 15-14.1-19(b)(2)(3)(6). Where the Family Court has jurisdiction under the UCCJEA, it properly may decline to exercise jurisdiction where to do otherwise would “open[] the door for jurisdictional conflict.” Jordan v. Jordan, 586 A.2d 1080, 1084 (R.I. 1991). 3', 'We note that the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations do not recognize a motion for reconsideration. This Court, however, has treated such motions as a motion to vacate under Rule 60 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See School Committee of Cranston v. Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d 629, 649 (R.I. 2009) (“Historically, we have allowed ‘motions to reconsider’ to be treated as motions to vacate under Rule 60(b) * * *.”).', '-7-', 'Because the order dismissing defendant’s motion for visitation based on the terms of the UCCJEA is a final order, he no longer may litigate issues concerning custody and visitation in this jurisdiction.', 'B', 'Missing Property Motion', 'Mr. Fiore additionally appeals the denial with prejudice of his motion for the return of missing property, asserting that his claim should have been withdrawn without prejudice. 4 He argues that his voluntary withdrawal of his claim was made so that he could have a jury trial in another court. In her reply, Gough avers that defendant attempted to withdraw his motion only after he had been afforded an evidentiary hearing and as the hearing justice was ready to render a decision. She further argues that defendant is attempting to “work the system” through multiple pro se appeals and in forma pauperis status.', 'Our review of the February 4 hearing transcript reveals that Fiore advised the court: “You know what, Your Honor, I am not wasting any more time. I want to withdraw. I just want to withdraw. Just -- they are taking everything. On this issue of the property, I don’t want to waste the time anymore.”', 'Significantly, however, defendant already had rested his case after presenting himself and plaintiff as witnesses and cross-examining plaintiff’s only witness. The defendant then affirmed that he would take the diamond earrings and requested “some type of monetary award for the oval table that’s missing,” acknowledging that he was unable to put a value on it. After determining that plaintiff was unwilling to offer any money for the table, the hearing justice said the defendant had not met his burden of proof about value, to which Fiore 4', 'Although Fiore did not originally furnish the February 4 hearing transcript to this Court for this appeal under Article I, Rule 10(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, he provided it to us at oral argument.', '-8- replied, “[t]hen I will let it go. I will let it go.” The hearing justice then ruled: “The diamond earrings can be returned. I believe that resolves the personal property issue.”', 'At the June 1 hearing, although Fiore alleged that he took the earrings to a jeweler and that they were not “the right ones,” he did not proffer an appraisal or any evidence to indicate that any verification took place.', 'After reviewing the February 4 transcript and hearing arguments from both parties at the hearing on June 1, 2011, the hearing justice stated, “I think the proposed order as presented by [Gough] reflects what happened that day.” We also have reviewed the transcript and concur with the hearing justice. The defendant’s attempted withdrawal of the motion occurred only after he had been afforded the opportunity to present his witnesses and evidence. The fact that at the eleventh hour he may have realized that he had been unable to prove his case does not entitle him to a second bite at the apple. Nor should the plaintiff be required to defend the motion in another forum. We are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not err in dismissing the defendant’s motion for the return of personal property with prejudice.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.

113,Kyle Campbell : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'The applicant, Kyle Campbell (Campbell or applicant), appeals from the Superior Court‟s denial of his application for postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that the trial justice erred in failing to appoint counsel before he dismissed Campbell‟s claims. Because G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-51 mandates that an indigent applicant for postconviction relief be represented by the Public Defender or appointed counsel, and Campbell was not provided with the appointed counsel to which he was entitled, we vacate the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 10-9.1-5 provides as follows:', '“An applicant who is indigent shall be entitled to be represented by the', 'public defender. If the public defender is excused from representing the applicant', 'because of a conflict of interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation,', 'the court shall assign counsel to represent the applicant. An indigent applicant is', 'entitled, to the extent deemed appropriate by the court, to be provided with', 'stenographic, printing, and other costs necessary to proceed under this chapter.”', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Campbell was convicted of first-degree murder in 1995. He was seventeen years old—a juvenile—at the time of the murder. The underlying facts are set forth in detail in our opinion affirming that conviction, State v. Campbell, 691 A.2d 564, 566-72 (R.I. 1997), and need not be repeated here. On March 22, 2004, Campbell filed a pro se application for postconviction relief. This application—Campbell‟s first—asserted six allegations of error: (1) the DNA evidence admitted against him in his trial was unreliable;2 (2) the state‟s failure to preserve exculpatory photographs violated Campbell‟s due process rights; (3) a Providence police detective testified falsely about Campbell‟s confession; (4) the trial justice erroneously prohibited Campbell‟s defense counsel from cross-examining another detective about blood found on one of Campbell‟s shirts and also erroneously precluded him from calling witnesses to testify about the loss of the photographs, all in violation of Campbell‟s constitutional rights to due process and confrontation; (5) the evidence against Campbell was insufficient to support a conviction; and (6) defense counsel‟s failure to call the police chief for the City of Providence concerning the circumstances of Campbell‟s confession amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. Campbell requested the appointment of counsel.', 'In response, the state moved to dismiss the application, arguing that four of Campbell‟s allegations of error were barred by principles of res judicata.3 Additionally, the state averred that Campbell‟s allegation of false testimony by a police detective failed to allege newly discovered 2', 'In his application, Campbell frames this contention in the following terms: “DNA [e]vidence submitted at Petitioner‟s trial was not sufficient to prove [P]etitioner‟s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” A review of the substance of this claim, however, convinces us that it is concerned with the unreliability of the DNA evidence offered against him. 3', 'Specifically, the state asserted that res judicata principles barred reconsideration of claims (1), (2), (4), and (5) of the six claims discussed above.', '-2- evidence, and therefore should be dismissed. Finally, with respect to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the state argued that Campbell‟s allegations failed to satisfy the two- pronged standard of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), and, accordingly, should be dismissed.', 'On April 1, 2005, Campbell appeared in Superior Court and once again requested a lawyer. Before addressing Campbell‟s request for counsel, the trial justice entertained argument on the state‟s motion to dismiss. The state pressed for immediate dismissal of five of the six allegations raised in the application, but conceded that “some sort of an investigation” should be conducted on Campbell‟s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel before it was dismissed. When the trial justice inquired whether Campbell wished to respond, he attempted to address the state‟s res judicata contentions. The trial justice explained to Campbell that there was “no question” that all of the allegations save for Campbell‟s contention about ineffective assistance of counsel had been adjudicated by this Court in Campbell‟s direct appeal. The trial justice accordingly granted the state‟s motion to dismiss in all respects except for the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial justice advised Campbell as follows:', '“What we do in cases like this is, I will appoint an attorney', 'to represent your interest. The Court appoints an attorney to make', 'an independent examination by discussing with you your concerns', 'about this. That lawyer will probably talk to [Campbell‟s trial', 'counsel], if [trial counsel] wishes to speak to him. He will review', 'the trial transcript and record, which is available because this case', 'went to the Supreme Court, and that attorney will make an', 'independent report to this Court as to whether or not that attorney', 'believes that you have merit to your allegation that you were not', 'given appropriate counsel in this case.', '“If that attorney‟s report says that he believes, that is, your', 'counsel, that there is cause to believe that you might not have been', 'effectively represented, then the Court will appoint an attorney to', 'represent your interest and a hearing will be conducted.', '-3-', '“ * * * If that attorney comes back and says we reviewed', 'the record, talked to the defendant, made an independent', 'investigation, and we don‟t feel there is merit to the defendant‟s', 'claim that his counsel was ineffective, then you have the right to', 'proceed with a full hearing, but representing yourself, not with a', 'court-appointed attorney.”', 'When Campbell expressed some confusion about why he may have to proceed pro se, the trial justice explained:', '“Because this independent evaluation done by an objective', 'attorney will have given me some guidance, and if they come back', 'and say we do feel there is something to Mr. Campbell‟s claim,', 'then I will appoint an attorney.” Significantly, the trial justice declared:', '“This independent lawyer doesn‟t represent you or me. He', 'is making this independent evaluation, and if he says, in my', 'opinion, based on my evaluation, I don‟t think there is anything to', 'claim, then you‟re still allowed to proceed with the claim, but I', 'cannot appoint an attorney for you so you have to do it yourself.”', 'The trial justice once more told Campbell that “[the appointed attorney] is not representing you. [He or she] is an independent person, not representing me either, the Court. [He or she] is a good, competent attorney that we ask to make this independent evaluation.” Counsel then was appointed to conduct this “independent evaluation.”', 'Meanwhile, Campbell filed two amendments to his application for postconviction relief. The first of these amendments assigned several additional errors to Campbell‟s trial counsel and added a second allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of his appellate counsel. The second filing put forth several allegations of attorney error arising out of the Family Court‟s waiver of jurisdiction over Campbell. Campbell contended that his Family Court counsel was ineffective in numerous respects, including the failure to seek this Court‟s review, by way of writ', '-4- of certiorari, of the Family Court‟s decision to waive jurisdiction.4', 'After his investigation of Campbell‟s arguments, appointed counsel detailed his findings in a memorandum that was submitted to the trial justice on September 16, 2005. Although all of Campbell‟s arguments except the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel previously had been dismissed, appointed counsel addressed the merits of all six arguments Campbell raised in his original application. This memorandum, purportedly compiled in accordance with Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), concluded that none of Campbell‟s arguments had merit; appointed counsel moved to withdraw from the case.', 'A hearing was conducted in Superior Court on the same day the “no-merit” memorandum was filed. After reciting counsel‟s conclusion that all of Campbell‟s arguments were meritless, the trial justice informed Campbell that only his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel could proceed to a hearing and that he had no right to be represented by an attorney. Campbell argued to the trial justice that he had met with appointed counsel only once—the week before the memorandum was filed. The trial justice again reminded Campbell that appointed counsel was “not here representing you, as I told you long ago. He represents the courts.” The trial justice granted the motion to withdraw, stating that “[appointed counsel] is allowed to withdraw because he was representing the Court in the matter.” Finally, with respect to the issue concerning the Family Court‟s waiver of jurisdiction, the trial justice suggested that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction over any contention concerning the Family Court proceedings, declaring, “I don‟t have anything to do with the Family Court.”', 'On November 18, 2005, a hearing was held on the remaining allegation of ineffective 4', 'Campbell also alleged that the prosecutor introduced perjured testimony and that the Family Court justice made incorrect evidentiary rulings, overlooked perjured testimony, and entered erroneous findings of fact.', '-5- assistance of trial counsel. Because Campbell was not represented by counsel, that circumstance complicated the proceedings. Campbell explained to the trial justice that he was not ready to proceed because he needed a lawyer and that, based on his interpretation of the relevant postconviction-relief statute, he was entitled to court-appointed counsel.', 'The trial justice disagreed with Campbell‟s interpretation and referred him to our decision in Shatney, which, the trial justice explained, “says that upon completion of a report in which the appointed attorney who does not represent you but who represents the Court comes back with a report of lack of merit, you are entitled to represent yourself at a hearing on the merits.”', 'The state then moved to dismiss Campbell‟s application in its entirety, based on Campbell‟s unwillingness to proceed pro se. Over Campbell‟s objection, the trial justice granted the state‟s motion to dismiss. Campbell appeals.', 'Standard of Review', 'The statutory remedy of postconviction relief under chapter 9.1 of title 10 is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant‟s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.” Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 1016 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 192 (R.I. 2008)). When reviewing the grant or denial of postconviction relief, this Court will uphold the trial justice‟s factual findings unless they were clearly erroneous or the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Pierce, 941 A.2d at 192). Nonetheless, we review “questions of fact concerning infringement of constitutional rights, and mixed questions of law and fact with constitutional implications, de novo.” Id.; see Pierce, 941 A.2d at 192. Additionally, we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.', '-6- Reynolds v. Town of Jamestown, 45 A.3d 537, 541 (R.I. 2012). Finally, questions about a court‟s subject matter jurisdiction similarly receive de novo review. Ims v. Audette, 40 A.3d 236, 237 (R.I. 2012).', 'Analysis', 'The issues on appeal can be grouped into two categories. Campbell asserts that the trial justice‟s dismissal of his allegations did not comply with the requirements of the postconviction remedy because he was entitled to appointed counsel as well as a meaningful opportunity to reply prior to the proposed dismissal. Additionally, Campbell assigns error to the trial justice‟s ruling that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to reach the question of the ineffective assistance of Family Court counsel. We address each of these contentions in turn.', 'I', 'Appointment of Counsel', 'The crux of Campbell‟s appeal is that the trial justice failed to appoint counsel to represent him in his application for postconviction relief. We begin by noting that the right to counsel in a postconviction-relief proceeding is a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional right. Because the postconviction remedy amounts to a collateral attack on a conviction, the action is civil in nature, for which there is no constitutional right to counsel. Pennsylvania v.

However, in recognition of an applicant‟s liberty interest in a postconviction-relief proceeding, the General Assembly has provided that:', '“An applicant who is indigent shall be entitled to be', 'represented by the public defender. If the public defender is', 'excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of', 'interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation, the court', 'shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” Section 10-9.1-5', '(emphases added).', '-7-', 'Under the clear and unambiguous language of § 10-9.1-5, an indigent postconviction- relief applicant is entitled to be represented by the Public Defender in the first instance. Only when the Public Defender is “excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation” must the court “assign counsel to represent the applicant.” Id. Thus, in any application for postconviction relief, § 10-9.1-5 anticipates that a member of the Public Defender‟s office shall represent the applicant or seek to be “excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of interest or [the Public Defender] is otherwise unable to provide representation * * *.” Id.', 'In cases in which the Superior Court excuses the Public Defender because a conflict exists, which frequently is the case, § 10-9.1-5 directs the court to appoint counsel “to represent the applicant.” (Emphasis added.) The hallmarks of a meaningful attorney-client relationship thus arise, including zealous advocacy and the protection of the applicant‟s confidences. Section 10-9.1-5 cannot be satisfied with anything less than a meaningful attorney-client relationship between appointed counsel and his or her client. Nothing we said in Shatney diminishes this requirement.', 'In Shatney, we established a procedure by which an attorney, including a member of the Public Defender‟s Office, who has been appointed to represent an applicant for postconviction relief may later seek to withdraw from that representation under specific and limited circumstances:', '“[U]pon notice to the applicant, counsel for an applicant may', 'request permission from the court to withdraw, based upon an', 'assessment that the application has no arguable merit. To do so,', 'however, appointed counsel must file with the court and serve', 'upon the applicant a motion to withdraw accompanied by a „no-', 'merit‟ memorandum that details the nature and extent of his or her', 'review of the case, lists each issue the applicant wished to raise,', 'and explains why in counsel‟s professional opinion those issues', '-8-', 'and any others that he or she may have investigated lacked merit.”', 'Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135 (emphasis added). The filing of this “no-merit” memorandum triggers a process that serves two interests. First, “[t]he court * * * must conduct a hearing with the applicant present.” Id. Then,', '“[i]f, based upon its review of counsel‟s assessment of the', 'potential grounds for seeking post-conviction relief and of any', 'other issues that the applicant wishes to raise, the court agrees that', 'those grounds appear to lack any arguable merit, then it shall', 'permit counsel to withdraw and advise the applicant that he or she', 'shall be required to proceed pro se, if he or she chooses to pursue', 'the application.” Id.', 'The procedure outlined in Shatney is consistent with Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which applies in postconviction-relief proceedings. Rule 11 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a party', 'represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney', 'of record in the attorney‟s individual name * * *. * * * The', 'signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the', 'signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper;', 'that to the best of the signer‟s knowledge, information, and belief', 'formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is', 'warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the', 'extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is', 'not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to', 'cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of', 'litigation. * * * If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in', 'violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own', 'initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented', 'party, or both, any appropriate sanction, which may include an', 'order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the', 'reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading,', 'motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney‟s fee.”', '(Emphasis added.) The procedure set forth in Shatney simply applies Rule 11‟s proviso to the context of the postconviction remedy, such that an attorney—whether private counsel or a member of the Public Defender‟s Office—appointed to represent an indigent applicant may withdraw from that', '-9- representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant‟s claims lack merit. Without the ability to withdraw from a case in which the applicant persists in pursuing meritless claims, appointed counsel could be subject to Rule 11‟s sanctions. See Anderson v. State, 878 A.2d 1049, 1049 (R.I. 2005) (mem.) (applicant‟s appointed counsel submitted “no-merit” memorandum and requested “that the court discharge him from representing petitioner in that proceeding in order to avoid violating Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure”).', 'Neither Shatney nor its progeny contemplates the appointment of an “objective” or “independent” lawyer who does not represent the applicant. Generally, Shatney considerations should arise after counsel has been appointed in accordance with § 10-9.1-5 and the applicant has been provided with a meaningful discussion with counsel about the issues that may or may not be suitable grounds for postconviction relief. Properly understood, Shatney envisions a multistep process in postconviction-relief proceedings initiated by indigent applicants: first, referral to the Public Defender, who may be excused based on a conflict; if so, counsel is appointed to represent the applicant under § 10-9.1-5, followed by an investigation, which may or may not lead to a motion to withdraw and a “no-merit” memorandum in accordance with the procedure set forth in Shatney.5', 'Additionally, our post-Shatney decisions reflect that counsel had been appointed to represent the postconviction-relief applicant. See, e.g., Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 1280 (R.I. 2012) (“A fourth attorney * * * entered his appearance for applicant on August 19, 2005, 5', 'We recognize that some attorneys may be reluctant or decline to enter an appearance on behalf of an applicant unless he or she is satisfied that there exists one or more meritorious claims and that an applicant may agree to that conditional representation. However, such a circumstance is not embraced by the dictates of Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), and the fact that counsel may decline the appointment should not result in the summary dismissal of an applicant‟s claims absent compliance with § 10-9.1-5.', '- 10 - and that attorney represented him throughout the remainder of the Superior Court proceedings for postconviction relief.” (Emphasis added.)); State v. Laurence, 18 A.3d 512, 523 (R.I. 2011) (“Ensuring that the applicant is allowed to speak to the professional opinion of his Shatney attorney at the hearing is a vital part of the process as it elucidates „what grounds [the applicant] still might have or may have wished to pursue in that application.‟” quoting Shatney, 755 A.2d at 133 (emphasis added)); Otero v. State, 996 A.2d 667, 671 (R.I. 2010) (referring to applicant and “his appointed attorney” (emphasis added)); Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 317 (R.I. 2008) (referring to “applicant and his court-appointed counsel” (emphasis added)); Young v. State, 877 A.2d 625, 627 (R.I. 2005) (attorney was appointed to represent the indigent postconviction-relief applicant, filed an amended application on the applicant‟s behalf, and only then submitted a “no-merit” memorandum pursuant to Shatney); Brown v. State, 841 A.2d 1116, 1123 (R.I. 2004) (“The applicant‟s court-appointed counsel complied with the Shatney procedures by filing a forty-page no-merit memorandum and discussing with the hearing justice the reasons he believed post-conviction relief was not warranted.” (Emphasis added.)).', 'Summary Dismissal', 'Notwithstanding § 10-9.1-5‟s directive that an applicant is “entitled to be represented by the public defender” or appointed counsel if the Public Defender is excused, it is well settled that summary dismissal of a meritless application is appropriate in certain circumstances under § 10-9.1-6(b). See Sifuentes v. State, 43 A.3d 49, 54 (R.I. 2012); Sosa, 949 A.2d at 1017. Section 10-9.1-6(b) provides:', '“When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application,', 'the answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not', 'entitled to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served', 'by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its', 'intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing.', 'The applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the', '- 11 -', 'proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the', 'court may order the application dismissed or grant leave to file an', 'amended application or direct that the proceedings otherwise', 'continue. Disposition on the pleadings and record is not proper if', 'there exists a genuine issue of material fact.”', 'We take this opportunity to declare that summary dismissal is appropriate when it is apparent that the applicant‟s claims are barred by res judicata. Section 10-9.1-8 “codifies the doctrine of res judicata as applied to petitions for post-conviction relief.” Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. DeCiantis, 813 A.2d 986, 993 (R.I. 2003)); see also Price v. Wall, 31 A.3d 995, 999 & n.10 (R.I. 2011). Section 10-9.1-8 provides in pertinent part:', '“Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly,', 'voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted', 'in the conviction or sentence or in any other proceeding the', 'applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a', 'subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the interest of', 'justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground', 'for relief.” As we explained in Taylor, 821 A.2d at 688, “[r]es judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with them.” See also Price, 31 A.3d at 999-1000. Accordingly, any claim barred by res judicata is subject to summary dismissal, “unless the court finds that in the interest of justice the applicant should be permitted” to pursue it. Section 10-9.1-8. These claims should be dismissed as soon as practicable.', 'However, as a prerequisite to any such dismissal, “an applicant must be provided with an „opportunity to reply to the court‟s proposed dismissal.‟” Sosa, 949 A.2d at 1017 (quoting Corners v. State, 922 A.2d 176, 176 (R.I. 2007) (mem.)). Moreover, the opportunity to do so must be meaningful. Harris v. State, 973 A.2d 618, 619 (R.I. 2009) (mem.); Mattatall v. State, 966 A.2d 125, 126 (R.I. 2009) (mem.). The applicant must be accorded a reasonable amount of', '- 12 - time to prepare a response to the court‟s proposed dismissal, “regardless of the merits” of the application. Mattatall, 966 A.2d at 126.', 'In this case, Campbell complains that the trial justice failed to observe the requirements of the postconviction remedy in two separate, but related, respects. First, Campbell insists that the trial justice erred in summarily dismissing five of his claims on April 1, 2005 without first providing him with appointed counsel and a meaningful opportunity to respond.', 'Second, Campbell argues that trial justice‟s appointment of an “objective attorney” to make an “independent evaluation” of the merits of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel violated § 10-9.1-5. We agree with these contentions.', 'A. Summary Dismissal of Five of Campbell’s Allegations', 'Campbell argues that during his first appearance before the trial justice, he was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to reply before the trial justice dismissed five of his allegations. Campbell contends that he was unable meaningfully to address the state‟s arguments in favor of dismissal because he did not have the assistance of counsel. The record discloses that the trial justice found that these arguments had been adjudicated by this Court in Campbell‟s direct appeal and summarily dismissed them. We deem this error.', 'Although this is the first time we have been called upon to determine whether the meaningful opportunity to reply as required by § 10-9.1-6(b) must include the appointment of counsel under § 10-9.1-5, we are not without guidance on this issue. In Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135, for example, we pronounced that the Superior Court was to follow the procedures employed in Pennsylvania for postconviction-relief applications. In setting forth these procedures, we quoted with approval multiple passages from the Pennsylvania Superior Court‟s decision in Commonwealth v. Harris, 553 A.2d 428 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989), including the following: “The', '- 13 - point in time at which a trial court may determine that a * * * petitioner‟s claims are frivolous or meritless is after the petitioner has been afforded a full, fair, and counselled opportunity to present those claims.” Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135 (quoting Harris, 553 A.2d at 433 (second emphasis added)). Similarly, in this Court‟s decision in Harris, 973 A.2d at 619, despite the indigent pro se postconviction-relief applicant‟s request for appointment of counsel, the trial justice summarily denied the application before appointing a lawyer. We held that the summary dismissal violated the applicant‟s rights to appointed counsel and an opportunity to reply to the dismissal. Id.; see also O‟Neil v. State, 814 A.2d 366, 367 (R.I. 2002) (mem.) (“[T]he motion justice erred in not first appointing counsel for O‟Neil before denying him post-conviction relief.”).', 'In addition to being the most harmonious construction of §§ 10-9.1-5 and 10-9.1-6(b), requiring the appointment of counsel before an applicant‟s claims are dismissed not only ensures that the applicant is provided with a meaningful opportunity to reply, but also serves several laudable ends. We recognize that some applicants may need counsel‟s assistance in order to appreciate that principles of res judicata, as enshrined in § 10-9.1-8, require dismissal of some or all of their claims and prevent the relitigation of those contentions. Additionally, appointed counsel may, in an appropriate case, frame the applicant‟s claims in such a way as to avoid § 10-9.1-8‟s waiver rule, by alleging ineffective assistance of counsel or a showing of credible newly discovered evidence.', 'Finally, we are cognizant that the application for postconviction relief currently under review is Campbell‟s first for a murder conviction arising when he was seventeen years of age. Although not determinative, the fact that this is Campbell‟s first collateral attack—on a conviction for which he received a sentence of life imprisonment—is significant. We also', '- 14 - recognize the practical considerations that arise when trial justices are faced with multiple, duplicitous claims for postconviction relief by repeat applicants who fail to appreciate the finality inherent in the doctrine of res judicata.', 'Thus, the inquiry into whether an indigent postconviction-relief applicant is entitled to counsel and a hearing should focus, at least in part, on how many applications have been filed. See Harris, 973 A.2d at 619; Shatney, 755 A.2d at 134-35; Louro, 740 A.2d at 344; cf. Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1287 (where a majority held that “an evidentiary hearing is required in the first application for postconviction relief in all cases involving applicants sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.” (Emphasis added.)). In Harris, 973 A.2d at 619, this Court explained that “an indigent applicant for postconviction relief has the right to appointed counsel for his or her first application for postconviction relief.” (Emphasis added.) See also O‟Neil, 814 A.2d at 367. In Louro, 740 A.2d at 344, we declared that an indigent applicant was not entitled to appointed counsel in his appeal from the dismissal of a successive application for postconviction relief. We concluded that it was not the intent of the General Assembly that postconviction-relief applicants would be entitled to have appointed counsel for appeals involving successive applications. Id.', 'In Shatney, we addressed the issue of repetitive attacks on a conviction and distinguished Louro on the basis that the applicant in Shatney had filed only one application for postconviction relief:', '“Some of the concerns underlying Louro, and similar cases from', 'other jurisdictions restricting the right to counsel in post-conviction', 'proceedings, are that repetitive, successive, piecemeal, or collateral', 'attacks on judgments of conviction may tax the limited resources', 'of the judicial system and constitute an abuse thereof. * * * These', 'same concerns, however, do not exist in the present case, involving', 'an initial application for post-conviction relief.” Shatney, 755', 'A.2d at 134-35.', 'For these reasons, we hold that, in order to have a meaningful opportunity to reply prior', '- 15 - to summary dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(b), an indigent, first-time applicant for postconviction relief must be afforded counsel upon request.', 'In this case, Campbell was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to reply before five of his allegations summarily were dismissed.', 'Campbell made several requests for counsel throughout the proceedings below. In his initial request, Campbell explained that, because he had no legal training or experience, he could neither properly frame the issues nor persuasively argue their merit. Although after hearing argument from the state on its motion to dismiss, the trial justice inquired whether Campbell wished to be heard, Campbell‟s ad hoc response demonstrates that this opportunity to reply was not meaningful; his answer was brief and revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of res judicata principles.6 Campbell cannot be faulted for his inability to effectively respond to the state‟s contentions; it was for this very reason that Campbell vigorously requested appointment of counsel. Therefore, we agree with Campbell that the absence of appointed counsel before five of his allegations were dismissed deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to reply.', 'The state offers two grounds for affirming the summary dismissal of five of Campbell‟s 6', 'After hearing argument from the state, the trial justice asked Campbell, “Do you wish to respond to any of that?” Campbell responded:', '“First of all, I would like to object to [the state‟s representative‟s] allegations and', 'her opinions into my matters.', '“Before I filed my postconviction[-relief application], I made sure every issue was', 'not adjudicated. I understand that is her contention, that that would be her', 'contention in open court, but all of my issues I have raised were actually filed', 'with the language being different from what was raised on appeal. Um, that is all', 'I have to say in the matter.” This Court has made clear that “[an applicant] for post-conviction relief cannot escape the effect of claim preclusion merely by using different language to phrase an issue and define an alleged error.” Price v. Wall, 31 A.3d 995, 999-1000 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Overstreet v. State, 877 N.E.2d 144, 150 n.2 (Ind. 2007)).', '- 16 - allegations. First, the state contends that because appointed counsel gratuitously addressed these five allegations in his “no-merit” memorandum, Campbell received that which the statute required. Second, the state argues that the trial justice properly concluded that all five of these allegations were barred by principles of res judicata. We reject these contentions.', 'The fact that appointed counsel ultimately addressed the dismissed allegations in his “no- merit” memorandum is irrelevant. An order had been entered dismissing these allegations months before appointed counsel filed his “no-merit” memorandum.', 'Section 10-9.1-6(b) provides that “[t]he applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal[,]” (emphasis added), and it clearly anticipates that the opportunity to reply must come prior to, and not after, the claims are dismissed.', 'With respect to the res judicata considerations, there appears to be merit to the state‟s argument that these claims are precluded. We briefly set forth the issues raised in these five allegations. Campbell first alleged that the DNA evidence admitted against him was unreliable. However, Campbell raised a nearly identical argument in his direct appeal. See Campbell, 691 A.2d at 571. We held that the trial justice did not err in admitting the evidence. Id. at 571-72. Therefore, it appears that this claim is barred by § 10-9.1-8.', 'Campbell next argued that the state‟s failure to preserve exculpatory photographs violated his due process rights under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. Campbell raised a similar argument in his direct appeal, contending that “the trial justice erred by refusing to pass the case because the misplaced evidence might have been of exculpatory value to defendant, and could have constituted a critical part of defendant‟s defense.” Campbell, 691 A.2d at 569. We affirmed the trial justice‟s decision in Campbell based on the overwhelming evidence of Campbell‟s guilt and the absence of bad faith in the loss of the photographs. Id. at', '- 17 - 569-70. Thus, Campbell‟s second claim, a “ground finally adjudicated” in his direct appeal, also appears precluded. Section 10-9.1-8.', 'Campbell‟s third, fourth, and fifth allegations—that a detective gave false testimony concerning Campbell‟s confession; that the trial justice erroneously prohibited Campbell‟s defense counsel from cross-examining another detective; and that the evidence against Campbell was insufficient to support a conviction—were not decided by this Court in Campbell. This circumstance does not, however, insulate these allegations from the waiver rule set forth in § 10-9.1-8.', 'Despite the fact that each of these claims may ultimately prove to be barred by res judicata, the state‟s insistence that they can be dismissed before counsel is appointed overlooks the purposes of §§ 10-9.1-5 and 10-9.1-6(b).', 'In Shatney, we quoted with approval the Pennsylvania court‟s decision in Harris:', '“[T]he mandatory appointment requirement is a salutary one and', 'best comports with efficient judicial administration and serious', 'consideration of a prisoner‟s claims. Counsel‟s ability to frame the', 'issues in a legally meaningful fashion insures the trial court that all', 'relevant considerations will be brought to its attention * * *.

Appointment of Counsel', 'Turning to the appointment of counsel, we are of the opinion that the trial justice failed to comply with the mandate of § 10-9.1-5, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]f the public defender is excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation, the court shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” (Emphasis added.) Neither our holding in Shatney nor § 10-9.1-5 anticipates the appointment of an “objective attorney” to conduct an “independent evaluation” of the merits of an applicant‟s postconviction-relief application.', 'Rather, Campbell was entitled to the appointment of a lawyer to assist him in seeking the relief envisioned by the statute.', 'The trial justice notified Campbell that counsel would be appointed to represent him only if the attorney concluded that his allegations had merit. Likewise, the trial justice reminded Campbell at the hearing on September 16, 2005 that appointed counsel was not representing him. Finally, when, at the hearing on November 18, 2005, Campbell argued that he was entitled to 7', 'Although neither party has brought it to our attention, we pause to note that our disposition of this case is in no way inconsistent with Ramirez v. State, 933 A.2d 1110, 1112 & n.4 (R.I. 2007), in which we affirmed the summary dismissal of the applicant‟s third application for postconviction relief, notwithstanding the absence of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, because “we agree[d] with the trial justice that G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-8 precludes consideration of [the applicant‟s] third application for postconviction relief.” Not only was the application for postconviction relief under review in Ramirez the applicant‟s third, as opposed to the initial application at issue in this case, but also the applicant in Ramirez was provided the assistance of counsel on his third application. See Ramirez, 933 A.2d at 1111.', '- 19 - appointed counsel under § 10-9.1-5, the trial justice disagreed and pointed to our opinion in Shatney, which, according to the trial justice, “says that upon completion of a report in which the appointed attorney who does not represent you but who represents the Court comes back with a report of lack of merit, you are entitled to represent yourself at a hearing on the merits.” (Emphasis added.) At oral argument before this Court, the state conceded that Campbell was not provided with appointed counsel as required by § 10-9.1-5.', 'Finally, as discussed above, the fact that this is Campbell‟s first application for postconviction relief convinces us of the wisdom of limiting our holding to first-time applicants. Accordingly, we hold that an indigent, first-time applicant for postconviction relief is entitled to be represented in the first instance by the Public Defender, who shall meet with the applicant for a preliminary inquiry into the claim or claims which may form the basis of the requested relief. In cases in which the Public Defender “is excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation, the court shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” Section 10-9.1-5. When counsel—whether the Public Defender or appointed counsel—has been appointed, he or she may begin the process of investigating any claim or claims the applicant may have. If, after such an investigation, counsel deems it appropriate, he or she may seek to withdraw in accordance with the procedure set forth in Shatney. See Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. Because Campbell, a first-time applicant, was denied counsel, we vacate the judgment and remand this case with directions to the Superior Court to appoint counsel to represent applicant.', 'II', 'Because this case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion, we address the question of whether the trial justice erred in refusing to consider the', '- 20 - issues arising from the Family Court‟s waiver of jurisdiction over Campbell when he was seventeen years old.', 'Section 10-9.1-2(a) provides that “[a]n action to secure post conviction relief under this chapter shall be brought in the court in which the judgment of conviction was entered.” In this case, the conviction was entered in the Superior Court, and the application for postconviction relief properly was filed in that tribunal.', 'To be sure, the alleged errors in the juvenile-waiver proceeding of which Campbell complains arose in the Family Court. Nonetheless, the Family Court proceedings were in aid of the Superior Court‟s jurisdiction over Campbell such that the waiver by the Family Court of jurisdiction under G.L. 1956 §§ 14-1-7(a) and 14-1-7.1 was a condition precedent to a trial in Superior Court. Therefore, Campbell‟s claims concerning his Family Court attorney properly were raised in the Superior Court—the court in which the judgment of conviction was entered. See § 10-9.1-2(a). Accordingly, it was error for the trial justice to conclude that he was without jurisdiction to hear these allegations.', 'We note that the state insists that these claims hopelessly are barred by res judicata and additionally are devoid of merit. Although these contentions ultimately may prove true, they are beside the point. Because Campbell never was afforded the counsel envisioned by § 10-9.1-5, any conclusion that these allegations are precluded or meritless would put the cart before the horse.

Even if a child, with his or her parents, opted for the Truancy Court program, the child and parent could elect to transfer a case to the Family Court by requesting a trial or hearing before the Family Court at any time. Additionally, a child or parent could appeal a Truancy Court magistrate’s order to the chief judge of the Family Court under a statutory right of appeal pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-10-3.1(d), 11 further amplified by Family Court Administrative Order 2008-1. 12 The children and parents also were imbued with a statutory right to file a declaratory judgment in the Family Court under G.L. 1956 § 9-30-1. 13 Finally, a child and parent could seek further review in this Court under G.L. 1956 § 8-1-2 14 or G.L. 1956 § 14-1-52(a). 15', 'B', 'Superior Court Decision', 'On March 29, 2010, plaintiffs initiated an action in the Superior Court by filing a proposed class action complaint 16 and civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

On May 25, 2010, the judicial defendants also moved to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), 18 and moved to strike three of plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief 19 and plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees under Rule 12(f).', 'The trial justice heard oral arguments on defendants’ motions to dismiss and motion to strike, but before he rendered a decision, Chief Judge Bedrosian 20 promulgated administrative order 2010-2 on September 10, 2010.', 'C', 'Administrative Order 2010-2', 'Chief Judge Bedrosian’s administrative order set out written procedures that dramatically reformed the Truancy Court Diversion Calendar Program.

Administrative order 2010-2 also added a threshold requirement that a student must “[have] at least 10 days of absences and/or [the petition] state[d] that a student [was] habitually late or absent from school” before the Intake Department could refer a case to the truancy calendar.', 'Under the terms of the order, if a petition was determined to be suitable for the truancy calendar, it was to be assigned to a school location, and written notice would be sent to the parents. That notice would inform the parent that the child had been referred to the Family Court on a “wayward status offense of truancy,” and that the parents would have the opportunity to give valid excuses for the absences at the hearing. The notice would also set the location, time, and date of an initial meeting with a magistrate. If the child or parent did not appear at the truancy calendar, order 2010-2 stated, “a summons may be issued for the child and parent/guardian to appear.” See § 14-1-16. 21 21', 'Section 14-1-16, entitled “Summons of child or adult in charge of child,” provides:', '“Upon the filing of a petition, the justice, if satisfied that there is', 'reasonable cause for the petition, may issue a summons requiring', 'the child to appear before the court at a time and place named in it,', 'and shall also cause a summons to be issued to at least one of the', 'parents of the child if either of them is known to reside within the', 'state, or if there is no parent, then to the guardian or other lawful', 'custodian of the child, if there is one known to be so resident, and,', 'if not, then to the person with whom the child resides, if known.”', '-8-', 'The administrative order further required that, at the initial meeting, the magistrate was to discuss with the child and parents the two options that were available: the child could either participate in the Diversion Calendar Program or proceed to an arraignment on the formal juvenile calendar in Family Court. The order required the magistrate to read the truancy petition to the child and parent and to explain Rhode Island’s compulsory school attendance laws, the requirements for participating in the Truancy Diversion Program, and the child’s right to trial. The magistrate was also directed to inform the child that he or she could voluntarily leave the Truancy Diversion Program at any time or that he or she could be removed from the program, either for refusing to comply with its terms and conditions or if the child was charged with another offense. In the event that the child or parent did not appear at the initial meeting, the administrative order dictated that a summons could be issued.', 'If a child agreed to participate in the truancy program, order 2010-2 required that three documents be signed: (1) “Participant Guidelines,” (2) “Participant’s Forum Choice,” and (3) “Release of Confidential Information.” The order further elaborated that, at the initial meeting, the child and parent were to be advised of their right to hire an attorney at any time the child was enrolled in the Truancy Diversion Program. In those cases when the family was unable to afford the services of counsel, the matter could be placed on the formal juvenile calendar and, if appropriate, the child would be referred to the services of the public defender or court-appointed counsel. Order 2010-2 added that “Magistrates will assess the need for interpreters” and “[a]ll Truancy Diversion Program hearings will be recorded.” Lastly, the order explained that after a', '-9- magistrate found the child had substantially complied with the program’s requirements, he had the authority to dismiss the truancy petition. 22', 'D', 'Superior Court Law Suit', 'On October 8, 2010, the trial justice denied defendants’ motions to dismiss, without prejudice; he did, however, grant the judicial defendants’ request for an evidentiary hearing on subject-matter jurisdiction, and he permitted the parties to engage in discovery prior to that hearing.', 'E', 'Writ of Certiorari', 'On October 25, 2010, in a preemptive strike before an evidentiary hearing was scheduled, the administrator defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. The judicial defendants filed a separate petition for a writ of certiorari on November 26, 2010. 23 After a review of both petitions, we granted certiorari on December 10, 2010. 24 Before this Court, defendants make a number of arguments. Specifically, the judicial defendants argue that the Superior Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction: they contend that the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim is, in essence, a veiled appeal of plaintiffs’ petitions regarding waywardness and delinquency, over which the 22', 'The administrative order also describes that a magistrate may review a truancy case for only one year, unless there is just cause to extend this time. 23', 'On November 2, 2010, plaintiffs moved to amend the first amended complaint to add ten new plaintiffs and four new municipalities and the superintendents of their public schools as defendants; substitute then-acting Chief Judge Bedrosian for former Chief Judge Jeremiah; drop the defendant municipalities and superintendents with whom plaintiffs had settled; and clarify that plaintiffs sought a state-wide class certified against the acting chief judge of the Family Court, court administrators, and Truancy Court magistrates. The plaintiffs also filed an amended motion for class certification. 24', 'The petition for writ of certiorari was filed in this Court before an order reflecting the trial justice’s denial of the motion to dismiss was filed in the Superior Court. This case is ripe for decision, despite the fact that the Superior Court did not enter an order. See McKenna v.

Alternatively, they contend that if the matter involves error by the Family Court, the case should be heard by the Supreme Court, which has exclusive supervisory authority over inferior courts. The judicial defendants also challenge plaintiffs’ standing because some of plaintiffs’ cases were dismissed or transferred to the regular Family Court calendar before the initial complaint was filed, and the remaining plaintiffs’ cases have since been resolved. Therefore, they maintain, those plaintiffs do not face an imminent threat of injury nor do they seek real or articulable relief. Moreover, the judicial defendants argue that the case has become moot because the administrative order addresses each constitutional challenge raised in the complaint. 25 Further, the judicial defendants aver that, even if the Superior Court is cloaked with subject-matter jurisdiction, the doctrines of comity and abstention demand that the superior court dismiss the case, so that it more properly may be heard in the Family Court. Finally, the judicial defendants assert that plaintiffs’ suit against the judicial officers is barred by sovereign immunity, qualified immunity, judicial immunity, legislative immunity, and is improper under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.', 'The administrator defendants raise similar arguments; they insist that the substance of plaintiffs’ allegations involve core issues of the Family Court, and that, therefore, the case should be before that tribunal. In the alternative, they contend that the Supreme Court should hear this case because it has exclusive jurisdiction to oversee the Family Court’s actions and rulings. The administrator defendants also aver that they are uncertain whether any of plaintiffs’ claims remain pending in the Truancy Court, and, therefore, according to them, standing is at issue. As 25', 'The judicial defendants acknowledge that plaintiffs’ challenge to the ex parte communications between the magistrates and school administrators was not specifically addressed in the administrative order; however, they argue that Truancy Court proceedings are not adversarial and, therefore, the magistrates may properly communicate with school administrators to gather information.', '- 11 - to comity, the administrator defendants assert that, out of respect, courts of coordinate jurisdictions hearing the same case should not overrule each other’s decision. Finally, the administrator defendants argue that the plain language of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 bars injunctive relief against judicial officers. This prohibition, they contend, applies to them, as well.', 'In response, plaintiffs maintain that the case was brought properly before the Superior Court, because that court has subject-matter jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, and is vested with equitable jurisdiction. The plaintiffs also contend they have standing because the case should be addressed in the context of the proposed class action.', 'The plaintiffs argue that defendants have waived any claim of mootness, because they did not raise it before the Superior Court. Also, plaintiffs assert that their complaint is not moot because the administrative order does not address all of the constitutional challenges that they raised in their complaint. Finally, plaintiffs entreat this Court to hold that comity does not apply because they do not seek to collaterally attack any order of the Truancy Court magistrates.', 'Finally, plaintiffs submit that judicial immunity does not bar declaratory relief against the judicial officers.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A motion under Rule 12(b)(1) questions a court’s authority to adjudicate a particular controversy before it.

The issue of mootness as it pertains to each of plaintiffs’ ten alleged constitutional violations will be discussed in turn. 28', '1', 'Notice', 'The judicial defendants argue that the administrative order sets a minimum number of ten truancies, sufficient to give notice of the conduct that will result in a child’s eligibility for the Diversion Program. The plaintiffs insist, however, that the administrative order, while indicating that the Truancy Court participants will receive notice, nevertheless is vague because it does not specify how or when they will receive that notice.', '“Vagueness challenges under the [D]ue [P]rocess [C]lause rest principally on lack of notice.” Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565, 582 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.

This Court discusses, infra Part III, section B, whether an exception to mootness applies.', '- 16 - 453, 460 (R.I. 2006)). “[I]t is well settled that a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it lacks explicit standards from its application and thus delegates power that enables enforcement officials to act arbitrarily with unchecked discretion.” Id. (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Pare, 568 A.2d 1012, 1013 (R.I. 1990)). Further, “[a] statute is unconstitutionally vague if it compels ‘a person of average intelligence to guess and to resort to conjecture as to its meaning and/or as to its supposed mandated application.’” Id. at 583 (quoting Kaveny v. Town of Cumberland Zoning Board of Review, 875 A.2d 1, 10 (R.I. 2005)). Further, the fundamental requisite of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner; this certainly requires one to be forewarned about the subject matter of the hearing with sufficient detail so an intelligent explanation or rebuttal can be formulated. See Avanzo v. Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 625 A.2d 208, 210-11 (R.I. 1993) (citing Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 268-69 (1970)).', 'It is true that previously there was no guidance under the Truancy Court procedures or under G.L. 1956 §§ 16-19-1 29 and 16-19-6 30 as to the number of absences from school that were necessary to incur possible liability as a truant. However, the administrative order specifies a threshold number of ten days of absence before a child may be referred either to the Diversion Program or to the formal juvenile calendar. Indeed, administrative order 2010-2 states that “[t]he Intake Department may refer cases to the Truancy calendar if the petition: * * * [h]as at least 10 days of absences and/or states that a student is habitually late or absent from school.” We are 29', 'General Laws 1956 § 16-19-1, entitled “Attendance required,” provides that “[e]very child who has completed or will have completed six (6) years of life on or before September 1 of any school year and has not completed eighteen (18) years of life shall regularly attend some public day school during all the days and hours that the public schools are in session in the city or town in which the child resides.” 30', 'Section 16-19-6, entitled “Proceedings against habitual truants and offenders,” provides that a “habitual truant” is “every child who is required under § 16-19-1 to attend school and who willfully and habitually absents himself or herself from attending school.”', '- 17 - confident that a person of average intelligence need neither guess nor speculate about the number of absences that will result in a referral to the Truancy Diversion Program. See Moreau, 15 A.3d at 583 (holding that a statute is not unconstitutionally vague if it gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly).', 'Administrative order 2010-2 also details how notice will be delivered to the child and his or her parents. It states that if the Intake Department determines a petition is suitable for the Truancy calendar, the petition “will be assigned to the appropriate school location” and “written notice shall be sent to the parent/guardian.” The written notice informs the parents that the child “has been referred to the Family Court on a wayward status offense of truancy” and that the child “has been prescreened to enter the Truancy Diversion Program.” The notice explains that the parents will “ha[ve] the opportunity to provide valid excuses for absences, if any, at the hearing.” Finally, the notice briefly describes the Diversion Program and sets the location, time, and date of the initial meeting with a magistrate. See Avanzo, 625 A.2d at 210-11 (explaining that due process requires an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner). Accordingly, after reviewing the administrative order, we hold that its specific and clarified procedure affords children and parents sufficient notice of what conduct will subject them to a truancy proceeding and the manner in which the child and parents will receive notice of a truancy petition. In our opinion, plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge to the sufficiency of the notice requirement has been mooted by the administrative order.', '2', 'Preliminary Investigation', 'The judicial defendants further argue that the administrative order blunts plaintiffs’ complaint because it sets out a detailed procedure for a preliminary investigation. The plaintiffs', '- 18 - contend that there is no record that the Intake Department investigates the truancy petitions that it receives from school officials.', 'It is worth mentioning that we have recognized previously that an intake investigation is not required as a step in an accusatory proceeding of delinquency or waywardness: the investigation by the Intake Department “serves primarily to shield the child from arbitrary bureaucratic action and to forestall the Family Court from assuming jurisdiction when such would ill serve the interests of the juvenile and the public.” In re Leon, 122 R.I. 548, 552, 410 A.2d 121, 124 (1980) (citing In re Three Minor Children, 110 R.I. 11, 15, 289 A.2d 434, 436 (1972)); see § 14-1-10. 31', 'After a review of the revision to the preliminary investigation procedure, we conclude that the administrative order safeguards children from arbitrary bureaucratic action and that the Family Court, through its administrative order, has adhered to the statutory requirements. Indeed, order 2010-2 provides that “all truancy petitions shall be referred to the RI Family Court Intake Department for a preliminary investigation.” The administrative order also clarifies how the Intake Department shall determine if sufficient evidence and documentation exists to bring a child within the jurisdiction of the court. Administrative order 2010-2 specifically cites to § 8- 10-22, entitled “Intake department—Duties,” which states that the duties of the Intake Department 31', 'Section 14-1-10, entitled “Preliminary investigation on information furnished to the court,” states, in pertinent part, that the preliminary investigation', '“may include a preliminary investigation of the home and', 'environmental situation of the child, his or her previous history,', 'and the circumstances which were the subject of the information.', 'To avoid duplication of effort and to take full advantage of all', 'existing facilities, the report of any public agency, or of any private', 'social agency licensed by the department of children, youth, and', 'families, may be accepted by the court as sufficient evidence for', 'the filing of a petition.”', '- 19 -', '“shall be to receive applications and complaints relative to juvenile', 'matters presented to the court, to provide for a thorough', 'investigation of the applications and complaints, * * * to report', 'thereon to the court before formal petition is filed[,] * * * [and to]', 'perform such other duties as shall be assigned to it by the court.” The administrative order also cites to Rule 3 of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings, entitled “Intake procedure,” which requires that after a petition is submitted to the court, it is', '“referred to the intake department for preliminary investigation to', 'determine whether the facts are legally sufficient to bring the child', 'within the jurisdiction of the court and, if so, to determine whether', 'the interests of the public or of the child require that further action', 'be taken.” Rule 3 explains that preliminary investigation can include', '“investigation of the home and environmental situation of the', 'child, the child’s previous history and the circumstances which', 'were the subject of the petition. The report of any public agency,', 'or of any private social agency licensed by the department for', 'children and their families, may be accepted by the court for its', 'consideration.” The administrative order then expounds that upon a determination that there is sufficient evidence to assert the court’s jurisdiction, the Intake Department “shall determine the most appropriate level of judicial action,” which could be an “[a]ssignment of truancy petition[] to an Intake worker for further investigation and monitoring,” an “[a]ssignment of [the] case[] to the Truancy calendar,” or an “[a]ssignment of [the] case[] to the formal juvenile calendar.” Based on our review of the administrative order, we are completely comfortable that a sufficient preliminary investigation procedure is now in place.', '3', 'Summons', 'The judicial defendants aver that the administrative order informs that the Truancy Court program is voluntary in nature, and, therefore, a summons is not necessary. If the child and/or', '- 20 - parent do not choose to participate on a voluntary basis, the truancy petition is referred to the formal juvenile calendar, where procedural protections, including the service of a summons, are enforced. The plaintiffs respond that formal summonses are required under Rule 6 of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings and §§ 14-1-16 and 14-1-17, and that no requisite summonses were used.', 'The administrative order directs that a child and parent may “choose” to participate in the Truancy Program. In Rhode Island, it is well established that a summons is not required when a defendant makes a voluntary appearance, and thus waives the right to personal service. See Theta Properties v. Ronci Realty Co., 814 A.2d 907, 912-13 (R.I. 2003). Administrative order 2010-2 elaborates that if the child or parent does not appear at the Truancy calendar, “a summons may be issued for the child and parent/guardian to appear.” If the child and parent appear at the Truancy calendar, but “the student and parent/guardian do not each agree to participate in the Truancy Diversionary Program, the case will be referred to the formal juvenile calendar.” It is important that when a case is referred to the juvenile calendar, a summons is then served based on §§ 14-1-16, 14-1-17, and Rule 6(e). 32 Accordingly, it is our opinion that the administrative order, by essentially permitting the child and parents to choose either to participate voluntarily and waive service or to avail themselves of the juvenile calendar and its service requirements moot plaintiffs’ allegation that the Truancy Court does not properly serve notice upon the child and parents. 32', 'Rule 6 of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings, entitled “Summons,” provides, in pertinent part:', '“(e) Form for Truancy Court: Upon the filing of a truancy petition', 'the court shall issue a summons requiring the child and a parent, or', 'guardian, or lawful custodian, or a person with whom the child', 'resides to appear at a time and place as written therein for a', 'hearing on the petition.”', '- 21 -', '4', 'Arraignment', 'The judicial defendants maintain that the administrative order also negates plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges that the magistrates did not arraign children properly. The plaintiffs insist that their due process rights have been violated because defendants failed to provide adequate information regarding individual rights at the arraignment, as is required by Rule 9 of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings.', 'However, the administrative order elucidates that the term “arraignment,” although perhaps inelegantly employed, nonetheless refers to the initial meeting between the parent, child, and magistrate.', 'That occurrence focuses on, and is limited to, describing the program, explaining the conditions for participating in the program, and giving the parent and child the option of entering the program. Specifically, administrative order 2010-2 states that, at the “arraignment,”', '“the Magistrate will read the truancy petition and will explain the', 'Rhode Island compulsory school attendance laws as well as the', 'requirements of the Truancy Diversion Program consistent with the', 'document entitled Participant Guidelines. The Magistrate also will', 'explain the child’s right to trial as well as the option for the', 'Truancy Diversion program consistent with the form entitled', 'Participant’s Forum Choice. The Magistrate will explain the', 'Release of Confidential Information to the child and', 'parent/guardian.”', 'In particular, the “Participant Guidelines” provide that “[p]arents/guardians may hire an attorney for their child at this proceeding,” and “[i]f a parent/guardian cannot afford an attorney, the Court may appoint the public defender or court[-]appointed counsel.” The “Participant Guidelines” also specify that the Truancy Court may mete out the following sanctions: “[s]chool detention”; “[h]ome curfew”; “[h]ome confinement”; “[c]ounseling”; “[e]ducational, psychiatric or psychological testing”; “[c]ommunity service”; “[r]eferral for drug testing and/or treatment or', '- 22 - referral to the Drug Court calendar”; “DCYF Intervention, services and/or placement if necessary”; and “[a]ssignment of the truancy petition to the formal calendar.” Further, the “Participant’s Forum Choice” lists the rights of the child, including the “right to a trial by a [j]udge”; the “right to appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court from any decision or finding of waywardness”; the “right to have the petitioner prove each and every element of the offense(s) against [him or her] by evidence and by proof beyond a reasonable doubt”; the “right to the presumption of innocence”; the “privilege against self-incrimination”; the “right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against [him or her]”; the “right to present evidence and witnesses on [his or her] behalf and to testify on [his or her] own defense if [he or she] choose[s] to do so”; and the “right to appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court from any sentence imposed.”', 'This procedure mirrors the arraignment procedure specified in Rule 9 of the Rules of Juvenile Proceedings, which also requires that the court explain the right to counsel and appoint counsel when necessary, as well as', '“(1) the nature of the charges against the child, (2) the maximum', 'sentence that could be imposed, (3) the benefit of the presumption', 'of innocence, (4) the right to remain silent, (5) the right to confront', 'and cross-examine his or her accusers and the witnesses against', 'him [or her], (6) the right to testify and to call witnesses in the', 'child’s own defense, (7) the right to have the state prove the child’s', 'guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, (8) the right to appeal any', 'delinquency finding to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and (9)', 'the consequence of trial as an adult for all crimes if a child has', 'been twice adjudicated as delinquent by reason of felonies.” Id. Accordingly, we have no doubt that the administrative order sets out a procedure through which adequate information about individual rights, as mandated by Rule 9, is presented at the arraignment to the child and parents.', '- 23 -', '5', 'Waiver of Constitutional Rights', 'Before the administrative order was issued, each child was required to sign a “Waiver of Rights Form,” which waived “[his or her] right to a trial by a [j]udge and [his and her] right to appeal to the Supreme Court from any decision or finding of delinquency or waywardness” and “[his or her] right to appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court from any sentence imposed by the Court after the entry of [his or her] ADMISSION OF SUFFICIENT FACTS or ADMISSION.” This has been changed by the administrative order; a child now need only sign the “Participant Guidelines” form, which explains the expectations and requirements of both the child and parents who participate in the Truancy Court and includes a provision that the parents may hire their own attorney to represent their child and that the child or parent may request a trial with the formal juvenile calendar; the “Participant’s Forum Choice” form, which delineates the child’s various rights depending on whether he or she goes to trial or attends the Truancy Diversion Program; and the “Release of Confidential Information” form, which allows the court to access any information about any educational or medical issues of the child. If a child or parent is unwilling to voluntarily consent, the child is to be referred to the formal juvenile calendar and is afforded the substantive protection of the Rules of Juvenile Proceedings. See § 14-1-16; Rule 6(e). There is no reference to the “Waiver of Rights Form” in administrative order 2010-2, and no child is required to sign such a form.', '6', 'Right to Counsel', 'The judicial defendants submit that the administrative order moots plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge with respect to the right to counsel because the order directs that the child and parent will be advised of the right to hire an attorney and it further illuminates about', '- 24 - how the child or parent might obtain the assistance of counsel. The plaintiffs assert that this is not enough; they contend that their due process rights have been violated because defendants permit children to waive their right to counsel without first consulting with counsel. They also maintain that children are insufficiently protected because the order indicates only that the child “may” be referred to the public defender or court-appointed counsel.', 'In Rhode Island, § 14-1-31, entitled “Services of public defender,” explicitly states that', '“[p]rior to the commencement of any hearing, the justice shall', 'advise the parent or guardian of any child, or the adult involved, as', 'the case may be, that if he or she is financially unable to engage', 'counsel, he or she is entitled to the services of the public', 'defender.” Further, it is recognized that a right guaranteed by a statute may be waived, regardless of the plain and unambiguous terms by which such right is expressed. Gallucci v. Brindamour, 477 A.2d 617, 618 (R.I. 1984). Waiver in a criminal context must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, which a court determines by considering the totality of circumstances and facts surrounding a particular case. Wilkicki v. Brady, 882 F. Supp. 1227, 1231-32 (D.R.I. 1995). Although a juvenile hearing need not provide all the safeguards of a criminal trial, it “must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.” In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 30-31 (1967) (quoting Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 562 (1966)); see also In re Fiske, 117 R.I. 454, 457, 367 A.2d 1069, 1072 (1977).', 'Administrative order 2010-2 states:', '“The parent/guardian and student will be advised that they have the', 'right to hire an attorney for the child at any time during the', 'Truancy Diversion Program or, if they cannot afford an attorney,', 'the case will be scheduled on the formal juvenile calendar in the', 'county where the student resides. If a parent/guardian is', 'financially unable to engage counsel, the student may be referred', 'to the services of the public defender or court[-]appointed', 'counsel.”', '- 25 - We are satisfied that the administrative order meets the notice of the right to counsel requirement in juvenile proceedings. We are further satisfied that the administrative order properly addresses plaintiffs’ concern about the method used to inform the child and parents of the right to counsel, while delineating a procedure that facilitates a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver.', '7', 'Personal Jurisdiction', 'The judicial defendants argue that plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge for lack of personal jurisdiction is rendered moot because the administrative order is pointed and specific that participation in the Truancy Diversion Calendar is voluntary.', 'They declare that the administrative order sufficiently explains that if the child or his or her parents contest jurisdiction, the matter will be referred to the formal juvenile calendar, which will issue a summons to the child and parent. The plaintiffs assert that the magistrates are required to ensure that a proper summons is issued before any order is entered against a child or parent, but that the magistrates have failed to comply with that obligation.', 'As discussed above, § 14-1-11 33 states that the filing of a truancy petition constitutes assumption of jurisdiction over the child, and § 14-1-16 dictates that a summons should be issued to the child and at least one parent. Administrative order 2010-2 is clear that participation in the program is voluntary; indeed, the order states that the magistrate must “explain the child’s right 33', 'Section 14-1-11(a), entitled “Authoring and filing petition” states,', '“The filing of the petition constitutes assumption of jurisdiction', 'over the child. Filing shall take place upon authorization by the', 'intake department upon completion of its procedures pursuant to', 'Rule 3 of the Rules of Juvenile Proceedings, upon authorization by', 'a justice of the [F]amily [C]ourt pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules of', 'Juvenile Proceedings, or immediately upon appearance of the child', 'before the court following emergency detention, unless the court', 'otherwise orders.”', '- 26 - to trial as well as the option for the Truancy Diversion Program.” See Theta Properties, 814 A.2d at 912-13; Lundgren v. Pawtucket Firefighters Association Local No. 1261, 595 A.2d 808, 816 (R.I. 1991) (party who defends a claim without objecting to court’s lack of personal jurisdiction waives that jurisdictional defense). It is apparent that since the issuance of the administrative order, a parent and child are free to choose to decline to participate in the Diversion Program.', 'If they do, or if they contest jurisdiction, then the court will issue a summons to the child in accordance with § 14-1-16 and Rule 6, and to the parent pursuant to § 14-1-16 and Rule 6(d)-(e). Indeed, administrative order 2010-2 specifically explains that “[i]f the student or parent does not appear at the Truancy calendar, a summons may be issued for the child and parent/guardian to appear.” It is, accordingly, our opinion that any shortcomings about the establishment of personal jurisdiction arising from the operation of the Truancy Court have been remedied by the administrative order.', '8', 'Record of the Proceedings', 'Administrative order 2010-2 directs that “[a]ll Truancy Diversion Program hearings will be recorded.” As a result, the judicial defendants argue that plaintiffs’ complaints about the lack of a record have become moot. By contrast, plaintiffs insist that the administrative order does not moot the claim because the order does not state how the hearings will be recorded or whether the records will be verbatim. The plaintiffs argue that § 8-10-3(b) 34 supports their contention that failing to provide a stenographic or other verbatim record of all proceedings before the Truancy Court is a violation of plaintiffs’ rights. However, the judicial defendants assert that stenographic recordings of the Truancy Court proceedings are not required, because appeals 34', 'Section 8-10-3(b) provides that “[t]he [F]amily [C]ourt shall be a court of record and shall have a seal which shall contain such words and devices as the court shall adopt.”', '- 27 - from the Truancy Court go to the chief judge for a full hearing de novo, as was set forth in Family Court administrative order 2008-1, which describes the procedure to appeal a finding of a Family Court magistrate.', 'It is now crystal clear that “[a]ll Truancy Diversion Program hearings will be recorded.” It is true that § 8-10-37, entitled “Report of trials—Transcripts,” states “[s]ubject to the provisions of § 8-10-21, court reporters shall report stenographically * * * the proceedings in the trial of every action or proceeding, civil or criminal, in the [F]amily [C]ourt.” It is also true, as plaintiffs’ allege, that no stenographic transcriptions or audio recordings took place in the truancy proceedings at the time the complaint was filed. However, the promulgation of the administrative order has cured that affliction because the administrative order specifically requires the hearings to be recorded. In our judgment, the fact that Truancy Court proceedings are audio recorded, and not stenographically recorded, is sufficient.', '9', 'Interpreters', 'The judicial defendants contend that plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge to the appointment of interpreters has been rendered moot because the administrative order explains that the magistrates have discretion to determine when an interpreter should be made available for a child who is before the court and who may not be sufficiently fluent in English. The plaintiffs disagree; they say that the administrative order does not moot the claim, positing that interpreters should be provided to all individuals appearing before the Truancy Court, because the magistrates may not know whether a participant is in need of an interpreter without an interpreter.', 'Administrative order 2010-2 states that “Magistrates will assess the need for interpreters taking into account the participant’s desire for such services and ensure that interpreters be', '- 28 - provided for each Court session if necessary. This may include referring a case to the formal juvenile calendar.” The plaintiffs contend that it is inappropriate for the magistrates to have discretion to assess the needs for an interpreter. An interpreter, they say, should be present and available to all who come before the court. This Court has held “that a trial justice is entrusted with the discretion to appoint an interpreter if he or she determines that a defendant is unable to understand the English language adequately * * *.” State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 798 (R.I. 2004). We have long held that a trial justice is granted a wide degree of discretion in the “selection, appointment, and retention of an interpreter.” State v. Lopez-Navor, 951 A.2d 508, 513 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Deslovers, 40 R.I. 89, 115, 100 A. 64, 73 (1917)). Accordingly, it is our opinion that the administrative order passes constitutional muster with respect to the accessibility and use of interpreters.', '10', 'Ex Parte Communication', 'Even though the issue of ex parte communication was not directly addressed in the administrative order, defendants argue that doing so was not necessary because the Diversion Program was designed to provide a non-adversarial means for the resolution of truancy petitions. We agree that the administrative order does not directly address plaintiffs’ concerns with ex parte communication. However, we fully expect that the judicial officers of the Family Court will be faithful to the law on ex parte communication, as set forth in Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813, 819-21 (R.I. 2007). 35 We are confident that the Family Court will abide by this binding and well established law, and to the Code of Judicial Conduct, relating to ex parte communication. 35', 'In Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813, 819-21 (R.I. 2007), we held that, under the Administrative Procedures Act, Department of Human Services (DHS) hearing officers were prohibited from engaging in ex parte communications concerning adjudicatory facts with DHS staff members and outside resources about medical assistance applicants’ pending cases without giving applicants', '- 29 -', '11', 'Conclusion on Mootness of Plaintiffs’ Claims', 'After a review of the ten constitutional challenges raised in plaintiffs’ complaint, we are satisfied that they have been obviated by the administrative order and by existing law. Further, plaintiffs do not argue that the administrative order has not been properly adopted or implemented by the Family Court. Thus, plaintiffs’ request that the Superior Court declare the previous procedures in the Truancy Court to be unconstitutional and enjoin the Family Court from enforcing the prior procedures has become moot.', 'B', 'Mootness Exceptions', 'As an additional arrow in their quiver on the issue of mootness, plaintiffs maintain that the “extreme public importance capable of repetition yet evading review” exception to mootness applies here, because there can be no assurance that the Family Court will not revert to the earlier version of the administrative order when this litigation has come to an end. The defendants respond by arguing that the claims are not capable of repetition because the administrative order is binding. The defendants further argue that the claims will not evade review because, if the Truancy Court personnel do not comply with the administrative order, a litigant may pursue an appeal under §§ 14-1-52 or 8-1-2 to the Supreme Court or under § 8-10-3.1(d) and (e) or the Rhode Island Family Court Administrative Order 2008-1 to a judge of the Family Court and then to the Supreme Court.', 'We have held that “[t]his Court will review an otherwise moot case only when the issues are ‘of extreme public importance, which are capable of repetition but which evade review.’” an opportunity to challenge the information gleaned through such communications. We also recognized that ex parte communication is authorized for general or purely administrative matters pertaining to the discharge of a duty, such as procedural or timing matters. Id. at 821.', '- 30 - Campbell v. Tiverton Zoning Board, 15 A.3d 1015, 1022 (R.I. 2011) (quoting H.V.

(quoting H.V. Collins Co., 990 A.2d at 848). A case is “capable of repetition yet evading review” if there is a “reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975). The “same action” generally refers to particular agency policies, regulations, guidelines, or recurrent or identical agency actions. Public Utilities Commission of California v. F.E.R.C., 236 F.3d 708, 715 (D.C. Cir. 2001). We have cautioned, however, that this exception for issues of extreme public importance capable of repetition but evading review is “a narrow exception to the mootness doctrine.” Campbell, 15 A.3d at 1022 (quoting In re Westerly Hospital, 963 A.2d 636, 638 (R.I. 2009) (mem.)).', 'Here, to the extent that the issues in this case were once of extreme public importance, the chief judge of the Family Court has addressed them by establishing the proper procedures for the Truancy Court via the administrative order. See Cicilline, 809 A.2d at 1106.', 'As to the issue of whether the matter is capable of repetition, it is well recognized that “[a] defendant’s voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct ordinarily does not suffice to moot a case.” Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 174. Indeed, there may be an exception if there is a “substantial likelihood that the challenged statutory language will be reenacted,” or where the statute is replaced by a statute with narrower but still similar language. Coral Springs Street Systems, Inc. v. City of Sunrise, 371 F.3d 1320, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2004). This likelihood exists when, for example, a defendant has signaled an intention to reenact the challenged', '- 31 - statutory language, or where it has already been replaced by “another constitutionally suspect law.” Id. at 1330.', 'However, defendants have not signaled any intention to, or made any threat to, reenact a suspect administrative order; therefore, injunctive and declaratory relief are mooted.

Hairston, 920 F.2d 409, 415 (6th Cir. 1990)). Thus, “[a] declaratory judgment on the validity of a repealed ordinance is a textbook example of ‘advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.’” National Advertising Co. v. City and County of Denver, 912 F.2d 405, 412 (10th Cir. 1990) (quoting Blinder, Robinson & Co. v. United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 748 F.2d 1415, 1418 (10th Cir. 1984)).', 'In the dispute before us, there is no argument offered that there is any indication whatsoever that the Family Court has any intention of reinstating the previous practices about which plaintiffs’ complained. See, e.g., Covenant Christian Ministries, Inc. v. City of Marietta, Georgia, 654 F.3d 1231, 1239 (11th Cir. 2011) (“When a party challenges an ordinance and seeks injunctive relief, a superseding ordinance moots the claim for injunctive relief.”); National Advertising Co. v.

The general assumption that an agency will be faithful to its own regulations, therefore, stands. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency, 446 F.3d 140, 148 (D.C. Cir. 2006).', 'Further, it is significant that this case does not involve a short-term administrative order, the subject of which might be an issue that is “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” Carroll v. President and Commissioners of Princess Anne, 393 U.S. 175, 179 (1968) (quoting Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1910)). The plaintiffs offer no reason to expect that the Family Court will repeat the alleged constitutional violations that were superseded by the administrative order. It is speculative, at best, whether any unconstitutional procedures may recur in the future. See Cicilline, 809 A.2d at 1106.', 'This Court also must presume that the Family Court forthrightly will abide by its administrative order and properly consider the full impact of any future administrative orders.', 'Finally, even if the matter is capable of repetition, it would not evade review; there are many avenues for a plaintiff to appeal.', 'Determinations by Truancy Court magistrates are reviewable by statute, and thus hardly evade review. See § 8-10-3.1(d), (e) (“A party aggrieved by an order entered by a magistrate shall be entitled to a review of the order by a justice of the [F]amily [C]ourt. * * * Final orders of the [F]amily [C]ourt entered in a proceeding to review an order of a magistrate may be appealed to the [S]upreme [C]ourt.”); see also Family Court Administrative Order 2008-1 (clarifying the right to appeal Truancy Court determinations to a justice of the Family Court). Further review is also available in the Supreme Court, under § 14- 1-52(a), which states that “[f]rom any final decree, judgment, order, decision, or verdict of the [F]amily [C]ourt * * * there shall be an appeal to the [S]upreme [C]ourt,” and § 8-1-2, which provides that “[t]he [S]upreme [C]ourt shall have general supervision of all courts of inferior', '- 33 - jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein when no other remedy is expressly provided * * *.” Accordingly, plaintiffs have not met the difficult burden of showing that the circumstances which gave rise to the controversy in this case, although moot, are of extreme public importance capable of repetition yet evading review, rendering this case unreviewable. Thus, there is no exception to the mootness doctrine that would justify our deciding this case on its merits.', 'We hold that there are no ongoing truancy petitions that continue to be affected by the earlier Truancy Court procedures; this Court finds no ongoing controversy in which the plaintiffs have an articulable stake. See H.V. Collins, 990 A.2d at 848 (requiring articulable stake in outcome). Granting the plaintiffs’ requested relief would not have any significant effect. See Lynch, 994 A.2d at 71 (explaining that a question is moot if judgment would have no practical effect on the controversy). Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiffs’ claims have become moot, and because we so hold, we need not, and do not, reach the other issues raised in this case. 36 36', 'We pause to acknowledge, however, that, although we decide this case on grounds of mootness, it is our belief based on the existing record that the Family Court would have been the more appropriate forum to review the challenges raised in plaintiffs’ complaint. Comity permits, but does not require, a court to stay a pending proceeding if a case involving the same parties and subject matter is pending in another court with overlapping jurisdiction. See Halliwell v. Lippitt Realty Co., 120 R.I. 927, 927, 394 A.2d 708, 709 (1978). Comity is a flexible doctrine that rests on several principles, including “foster[ing] cooperation, promot[ing] harmony, and build[ing] goodwill” among co-equal courts. 16 Am. Jur. 2d Conflict of Law § 11 at 25 (2009). It serves as “a necessary expedient to preserve the delicate balance of power and harmonious relations among the various courts.” Id.; see United States v. Nippon Paper Industries Co., 109 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1997) (“Comity is more an aspiration than a fixed rule, more a matter of grace than a matter of obligation.”). We further acknowledge that the trial justice may well have come to the same conclusions in this case as did this Court. However, the case was reviewed by this Court at an early stage pursuant to our issuance of a writ of certiorari.', 'Here, the Superior Court was asked to make a ruling that could have found prior proceedings in the Family Court to have been invalid. In our opinion, and although we do not decide the matter on that basis, this cuts against the grain of the effective administration of justice and the principle of respect among the various courts of concomitant jurisdiction.', '- 34 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the order of the Superior Court and remand the record to that tribunal, with our decision endorsed thereon and with directions to enter a final judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ civil action as moot.', 'Justice Goldberg did not participate.', '- 35 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Elizabeth Boyer et al. v.

She further testified that defendant then kissed her on the lips and touched her ―[w]ith his fingers‖ as he was kissing her. When asked by the prosecutor whether defendant touched her over or under her clothes, Stephanie responded that he had touched her under her clothes. The prosecutor then asked her: ―[W]hen he touched you under your clothes, what did he do?‖ Stephanie’s response to that question was that he ―touched [her] private.‖ She testified that defendant told her: ―You’re beautiful‖ and that he also said: ―Don’t tell anyone.‖ Stephanie also testified that defendant was in her bedroom for about fifteen minutes; but, upon further inquiry by the prosecutor, she acknowledged that she was trying to estimate the time and that ―maybe‖ defendant had been there for less than fifteen minutes.', 'Stephanie testified that she then heard someone walking up the stairs and that defendant ran out of her bedroom.

Stephanie’s father testified that he ―got distracted‖ talking to his friends and that between five and ten minutes went by without his seeing defendant. He further testified that he then went inside in order to ―see what happened.‖ Stephanie’s father stated that he did not see anyone in the kitchen; he added that his younger daughter and his grandson were in the living room at the time. The father testified that he next walked into defendant’s bedroom, then into the bathroom, and then down the stairs into the basement—all presumably while searching for defendant.', 'Stephanie’s father testified that he next looked again into the living room and ―screamed‖ for his daughters Natalie and Stephanie, neither of whom responded. The father testified that one small bedroom and two larger bedrooms were located upstairs.

He further testified that, when he entered Stephanie’s room, he turned the light on and saw Stephanie crying and sitting on one corner of her bed. According to his testimony, the father then asked her: ―Did he touch you?‖ He testified that his daughter ―shook her head‖ and said: ―Yeah.‖ He explained that the question that he addressed to Stephanie was ―the first thing that came out of [his] mouth‖ and was prompted by the fact that he had seen defendant ―up there.‖ The father added: ―Why would a kid be in the corner of [her] bed crying?‖', 'It was the further testimony of Stephanie’s father that he then ―blacked out‖ and that certain members of his family came to the house ―in minutes‖ and called the police, who arrived ―immediately.‖ He testified that he stayed outside, surrounded by family, until the police arrived; he added that at some point thereafter he saw defendant being led out of the house. He also testified that his wife took Stephanie to the hospital immediately.', 'Stephanie’s father testified that, on the day following the alleged molestations, he received a phone call from defendant about his bail.', 'He also stated that during that call defendant said: ―If you want, I got some money in my dresser, bail me out and take me for a ride', '-6- and shoot me twice.‖ Stephanie’s father added that defendant called him again two days later and told him that ―he didn’t do nothing wrong.‖ According to his testimony, the father had not had prior suspicions about his uncle.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Lieutenant Joseph Gonsalves', 'Joseph Gonsalves, a retired lieutenant in the Central Falls Police Department, also testified regarding the evening of June 30, 2007.

Gonsalves’s testimony, he knew Stephanie’s father as a resident of the area; when defense counsel asked him if he had had ―prior interaction‖ with Stephanie’s father, he responded that he had. Lieutenant Gonsalves testified that, when he arrived at 131 Lincoln Avenue, at approximately 10:15 p.m., he found the complaining witness’s father sitting on the ground in the driveway; he described him as distraught, very upset, and in the process of being consoled by his family. He described the scene outside the house as ―chaotic.‖ Lieutenant Gonsalves spoke with Stephanie’s father, met with Stephanie’s mother inside the house, and proceeded to speak with Stephanie. Lieutenant Gonsalves testified that Stephanie was in one bedroom and that he observed defendant in another bedroom. He stated that, as he prepared to speak with Stephanie, she appeared to him to be ―scared, afraid, [and] nervous.‖ He added that, based upon the information he received, he directed one of the other officers on the scene to take defendant into custody. Lieutenant Gonsalves further testified that Stephanie and her mother', '-7- thereafter came to the police station, where he took a witness statement from the mother only. He next advised the mother and daughter to seek treatment at a hospital.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Dr. Christine Fortin', 'Christine Fortin, a board-certified pediatrician, testified that Stephanie came to the Hasbro Children’s Center outpatient clinic on August 22, 2007 for an evaluation at the Sexual Abuse Clinic. Doctor Fortin testified that, although Stephanie’s mother reported that Stephanie had been examined in an emergency room on June 30, 2007, Dr. Fortin herself did not examine Stephanie until August 22 of that year.', 'Doctor Fortin testified that she ―took a history‖ from both Stephanie and her mother in order to make medical decisions, such as those about which laboratory tests to perform. She also testified that it is her practice to ask specific questions of alleged sexual assault victims for the purposes of deciding which treatments and tests are necessary. Doctor Fortin testified that the tests performed would be different for alleged digital penetration as contrasted with alleged penile penetration. According to Dr. Fortin’s testimony, the most common finding in alleged digital penetration cases would be a ―normal‖ physical exam, which means that there would not be ―any injuries or other physical evidence.‖ Doctor Fortin explained that a ―normal‖ physical exam neither rules out nor confirms that sexual abuse has occurred. She testified that, in her experience treating alleged victims who report digital penetration, approximately 90-95 percent of alleged victims have a ―normal‖ physical examination. Doctor Fortin testified that Stephanie told her that she had been digitally penetrated. Then, Dr. Fortin testified as to the examinations performed on Stephanie and what those examinations entailed. Specifically, Dr. Fortin testified', '-8- that she found a ―normal‖ examination for Stephanie and that she recommended that Stephanie seek a follow-up with her physician and mental health counseling.', 'E', 'The Verdict and Subsequent Motion for New Trial', 'On Thursday, July 1, 2010, the jury returned with a verdict finding defendant guilty of all three counts that had been submitted to the jury. Subsequently, on October 18, 2010, the parties appeared before the trial justice for a hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice ultimately denied defendant’s motion.', 'The trial justice sentenced defendant on March 4, 2011 to the following terms: (1) on count 1, defendant was sentenced to forty years, with twenty-two years to serve; (2) on count 2, defendant was sentenced to ten years, with five years to serve; and (3) on count 4, defendant was sentenced to ten years, with five years to serve. The sentences were to run concurrently, with credit for time served. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When a trial justice rules on a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, he or she ―acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.‖ State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 70 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Acting as the thirteenth juror, the trial justice has the ―responsibility to conduct an analytical process consisting of at least three steps.‖ State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011). This three step process requires the trial justice to ―(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3)', '-9- determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.‖ State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1244–45 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Upon the conclusion of the three-step analytical process, if the trial justice ―agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.‖ State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). If, however, the trial justice disagrees with the verdict or ―does not agree that reasonable minds could differ as to the proper disposition of the case,‖ Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted), then the trial justice ―is required to determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.‖ Id.

Gonsalves tended to corroborate Stephanie’s testimony and the testimony about the ―condition‖ of the father.', 'The trial justice expressly noted that the crucial question for the jury was one of credibility—and most especially the believability (vel non) of the complaining witness. The trial justice stated that there was ―no question‖ that ―the facts, if believed, by the jury as to what [Stephanie] said would satisfy the three elements of the counts before the Court.‖ The trial justice found that Stephanie was credible and honest in her testimony and ―in her appearance,‖ that the jury believed Stephanie, and, moreover, that her father’s testimony corroborated Stephanie’s testimony ―in some fashion.‖ With respect to the father’s testimony, the trial justice found that he was credible and that she did ―not necessarily disbelieve‖ his testimony, although she did comment that she had the sense that something was ―being left out of the story.‖ Even taking into account her own observation that something was ―being left out,‖ the trial justice found that the witnesses were credible, that the jury made a decision in conformity with the', '- 11 - charge, and that she herself would not have reached a different conclusion. See Texieira, 944 A.2d at 140–42 (discussing the weight afforded a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial, particularly when the trial justice has articulated his or her reasoning in making that decision); see also State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012) (―We have also * * * acknowledged that the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.‖).', 'Although defendant challenges the credibility findings of the trial justice, ―[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.‖ State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011) (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). We would further note that the trial justice, because she was ―present during all phases of the trial, [was] in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.‖ Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has repeatedly stated that the trial justice has the benefit of first-hand observation of the witnesses, and we accordingly ―give considerable deference to the reliability and credibility determinations‖ made by the trial justice. See Jensen, 40 A.3d at 780–81 (discussing the weight accorded by this Court to a trial justice’s credibility determinations). In our view, the trial justice correctly determined that the main issue in the motion for a new trial was one of credibility, and she explicitly found that the complaining witness was credible and honest.', 'In passing upon defendant’s motion for a new trial, it is clear that the trial justice completed each of the analytical steps that are called for when a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial. See Viveiros, 45 A.3d at 1244–45 (delineating the three required steps).', '- 12 - The trial justice summarized the evidence presented at trial in light of the jury charge. In addition, the trial justice noted that the jury ―obviously considered‖ the arguments made by defense counsel about the location of the alleged molestation and ―how that physically happened.‖ The trial justice added that the facts and evidence presented by Stephanie to the jury during the trial would support the verdict against defendant, ―if believed‖ by the jury. Additionally, the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence and then determined that she would have reached the same result. Accordingly, the trial justice quite properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007) (―If the trial justice concludes that he or she would have reached the same result as the jury did or that reasonable minds could differ as to the result, the motion for a new trial must be denied.‖); see also State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 949 (R.I. 2012).', 'After a review of the entire record, we perceive no clear legal error on the part of the trial justice nor misconception of the evidence in her credibility determinations. See Ferreira, 21 A.3d at 367. Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not clearly err or misconceive evidence in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

116,Nelson Bido : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The applicant, Nelson Bido (Bido or applicant), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a Superior Court judgment that denied his application for postconviction relief. He argues that the trial justice erred in dismissing his application that alleged, principally, the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel based on counsel‟s failure to move for dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial grounds. After a careful review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In May 2006, Bido was convicted of aiding and abetting murder and conspiracy to commit robbery. The underlying facts are set forth in detail in our opinion affirming that conviction. State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 825-27 (R.I. 2008). We therefore recount only those facts pertinent to the primary issue raised in Bido‟s application.', 'On April 15, 1991, Jorge Confessor (Confessor) was shot in the back and robbed of a brown paper bag containing approximately $29,000 in cash and check deposits in a Citizens Bank parking lot in Providence. Confessor was pronounced dead at the scene. An eyewitness to', '-1- the crime memorized the license plate number of the getaway vehicle; Providence police traced the license plate to Bido.', 'Shortly after the shooting, Bido returned to his apartment, and his then-girlfriend, Rosalinda Colon (Colon), hastily helped him pack up his belongings and leave. Bido disclosed to Colon that he was “in trouble” because he “did something wrong.” Bido told her that he was “going to New York,” and, within five minutes, Bido fled to New York City. Before doing so, however, he asked Colon to dispose of a bag, together with its contents, that he had left in the apartment. When she looked inside the bag, Colon discovered a firearm; this weapon later was determined to be the weapon used to murder Confessor. When the police arrived at Bido‟s home, Colon informed them that Bido had fled, and she directed them to the basement, where they seized the gun.', 'Providence police contacted New York City authorities, and, on July 2, 1991, two New York City police detectives arrested Bido after he entered a vehicle bearing the same license plate as the car used in Confessor‟s murder. Bido volunteered to the detectives that he knew that his arrest was “about Rhode Island.” At the police station, Bido agreed to speak with police, and he gave a statement explaining that he had let an acquaintance borrow his vehicle knowing that it would be used in a robbery. The New York City detectives relayed this information to the Providence police.', 'Bido remained in a New York jail for several months, awaiting a governor‟s warrant for extradition to Rhode Island. During this time, Bido married Colon, “apparently so that [Colon] could not be used as a witness against him.” Bido, 941 A.2d at 827. Meanwhile, Providence police traveled to New York along with attorney David Morowitz (Morowitz), the prosecutor who was assigned to the case in its early stages; however, the grand jury proceedings were not', '-2- completed within the statutory period, and Bido was released from police custody sometime in October 1991. On July 2, 1992, an indictment was returned by the grand jury.', 'It was not until 2005 that Bido was arrested and brought to Rhode Island. His trial, which commenced in May 2006, culminated in guilty verdicts for the crimes of conspiracy to commit robbery and aiding and abetting murder. In his direct appeal, Bido contended, inter alia, that an ambiguous statement he made to the trial justice, in the context of a request for new counsel immediately before the start of trial,1 should have been understood to be a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. Bido, 941 A.2d at 827-29. We declined to consider this speedy-trial contention, concluding that, because Bido “did not put forth his argument in a rational and recognizable posture to the trial justice[,]” it had not properly been preserved. Id. at 829. This Court affirmed Bido‟s conviction in all respects. Id. at 837.', 'On August 12, 2009, Bido filed a pro se application for postconviction relief, setting forth five allegations of error.2 After counsel was appointed to represent him, an amended application 1', 'Bido relied on the following statement he made to the trial justice:', '“I don‟t feel really comfortable with [defense counsel] representing me. I [sic]', 'been in prison three times for the same case already. I‟ve never rejected coming', 'here at any point. I don‟t know why they release [sic] me. I lived 15 years in the', 'same street, the same house with the same lady; filing security tax, the same', 'name. Why didn‟t they arrest me before I went to renew my green card at', 'immigration before? And right there they arrested me and told me that the case', 'was still open. And then they arrested me and then they released me back there.', 'And then I kept coming back to court during those three months, and three', 'months later they came back and arrested me again. And I [sic] been here for', 'eight and a half months or so. The first time, I was five and a half months there', 'waiting for them to come. And the second time they arrested me, I was there in', 'prison for four days. So, I don‟t know what is happening right now. I have never', 'been that type of person that they accuse me of.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822,', '828 (R.I. 2008). 2', 'Specifically, Bido alleged: (1) that the extradition process used by Rhode Island authorities to obtain custody over him from New York authorities was faulty; (2) that the fourteen-year delay', '-3- and accompanying memorandum of law were filed that exclusively focused on the allegation that counsel‟s failure to seek dismissal of the indictment on speedy trial grounds amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'An evidentiary hearing was held on April 16 and 19, 2010. Three witnesses testified: Bido, his defense counsel, and Morowitz. Bido sought to explain that, for much of the fourteen- year delay between his July 2, 1991 arrest in New York City and his 2005 arrest and extradition to Rhode Island, it was his belief that the case against him in Rhode Island had been closed. He also raised an alibi, declaring that he was in New York, and not Rhode Island, at the time of Confessor‟s murder and that when he was released in July 1991, he was told that Rhode Island had insufficient evidence to proceed against him. He testified that he took this to mean that the case was closed. Bido stated that he did not receive notice of the indictment and that, if he had been made aware of the charges, he would have returned to Rhode Island “right away.” Bido testified that it was only in 2005, when he went to the Department of Homeland Security on an unrelated matter, that he learned—to his surprise—that the Rhode Island charges remained outstanding. between Bido‟s 1991 arrest in New York City and his 2005 extradition to Rhode Island violated his speedy-trial rights; (3) that a search of his Rhode Island apartment shortly after Confessor‟s murder, to which Colon had consented, was unconstitutional; (4) that the state coerced Colon to testify against him by threatening her with criminal charges and the prospect of taking away her children if she refused to testify; and (5) that Bido‟s defense counsel was ineffective in numerous respects. Despite raising these five claims in his pro se application, in this appeal Bido solely focuses on the denial of his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to move for dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial grounds. We therefore deem all of Bido‟s other claims waived and will not discuss them in this opinion. See Catucci v. Pacheco, 866 A.2d 509, 515-16 (R.I. 2005) (explaining that a party waives an issue when it fails to brief or otherwise argue the issue before this Court).', '-4-', 'However, on cross-examination, he admitted that, when he was arrested in 1996,3 he was advised of an outstanding warrant in Rhode Island for the Confessor murder; he insisted that a New York judge informed him then that the Rhode Island case was closed. Additionally, the state established that, in 2005, Bido fought extradition from New York and that he declared in an affidavit that in 1996, when he was arrested in New York, he knew that the Rhode Island charges were pending.', 'Bido also testified that he lived openly in New York City from 1991 to 2005, and he explained that, if “[Rhode Island authorities] had wanted me to come to Rhode Island[,] [t]hey could have come to get me at my house. I‟ve never been hiding.” He described the several locations where he lived during this time4 and stated that he had held a New York-issued driver‟s license and had held various jobs during this period, including a stint as a licensed taxicab driver. Bido referred to a statement from the Social Security Administration that showed the income he reported in the years between 1993 and 2006.', 'Bido further testified that between 1991 and 2005 he was no stranger to New York‟s legal system. He explained that he was arrested “[s]everal times” during this period.5 Bido testified that each time he was arrested he provided his name and address to authorities. 3', 'The record reveals that Bido was arrested in 1996 for running a red light and on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. 4', 'All told, Bido had six addresses over the fourteen years between 1991 and 2005: his mother-in- law‟s house, at which he lived immediately after his release in 1991; an apartment in his own name; three different apartments within one apartment complex, where he lived with Colon; and another address at which he occasionally lived with his girlfriend. With the exception of one apartment, none of these locations were held in Bido‟s name. 5', 'The state stipulated that Bido was in the custody of New York authorities on: May 8, 1996; again on February 12, 1999 until May 5, 2000; once more between February 17, 2005 and March 11, 2005; and, finally, from May 24, 2005 to August 5, 2005.', '-5- Additionally, Bido testified that he appeared several times in the New York City Family Court for child-support proceedings.', 'Finally, Bido testified that, after he was extradited to Rhode Island in 2005, he gave his defense counsel all the paperwork that had been prepared by his New York attorney, including a letter from his attorney that indicated that, based on the delay, a motion for a speedy trial should be filed on Bido‟s behalf. Bido‟s trial counsel testified that, based on his twenty-three years as a public defender, it was “unusual” for a defendant to stand trial on an indictment issued fourteen years earlier. Nevertheless, defense counsel admitted that he had not moved, either orally or in writing, to dismiss the indictment on speedy-trial grounds.', 'Morowitz testified for the state and indicated that, after Bido‟s July 1991 arrest, he drove to New York with two police officers to interview Bido about Confessor‟s murder. Although Bido initially indicated a willingness to cooperate with the state in its investigation of the murder, he quickly proved to be uncooperative, at which point Morowitz told him that he would be charged with murder. Bido was indicted in July 1992; Morowitz was unable to explain how the case was handled thereafter, other than to say that another member of the attorney general‟s staff would have handled Bido‟s extradition.', 'In a bench decision, the trial justice, who also presided at Bido‟s trial, denied the application. In reaching his conclusion, the trial justice first addressed Bido‟s speedy-trial claim, using the four-factor speedy-trial framework established by the United States Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972), and adopted by this Court in Tate v. Howard, 110 R.I. 641, 647-48, 296 A.2d 19, 23-24 (1972). That framework consists of an evaluation of the following factors: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant‟s assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and (4) prejudice to the defendant. Barker, 407 U.S. at', '-6- 530; Tate, 110 R.I. at 648, 296 A.2d at 23-24. The trial justice found that the delay in this case was presumptively prejudicial, thereby triggering an analysis of the remaining Barker factors.', 'The trial justice next remarked that the issue “probably critical to the case” was the reason for the delay. The trial justice found that from Bido‟s getaway on the day of the murder, which the trial justice termed “classic flight,” to his eleventh-hour request for appointment of new counsel—on the eve of trial and after a plea bargain was rejected—over fifteen years later, Bido doggedly had pursued a strategy of avoiding a trial on the indictment. The trial justice further found that, despite being aware of the Rhode Island charges after his arrests in 1991 and again in 1996, Bido refused voluntarily to return to Rhode Island. The trial justice placed particular emphasis on the fact that, contrary to his testimony that he first learned that the indictment was pending in 2005, Bido contested extradition in 2005 and declared in his affidavit that, after his 1996 arrest, he knew that the charges were pending and nevertheless refused to return to Rhode Island.', 'The trial justice also found it significant that, after his July 1991 arrest, Bido married Colon; he characterized this marriage as an effort to prevent Colon from testifying against him. Additionally, although the trial justice recognized that Bido remained in New York City until 2005, when he was extradited to Rhode Island, he found that Bido worked many jobs and lived in several locations, most of which were in the names of his wife or girlfriend. The trial justice also noted that Bido fought extradition in 2005 and found this to be further evidence of a deliberate effort to avoid returning to Rhode Island. Finally, the trial justice observed that, at the “last minute,” Bido moved for a continuance of his trial to obtain new counsel, shortly after he learned that Colon was on her way to Rhode Island to testify against him.', '-7-', 'Most', 'significantly,', 'the', 'trial', 'justice', 'found', 'that', 'Bido‟s', 'testimony', 'at', 'the postconviction-relief hearing was not credible. The trial justice explained that, notwithstanding the testimony of several trial witnesses that Bido was in the state at the time of Confessor‟s murder, Bido insisted that he was not in Rhode Island at that time. The trial justice declared, “[T]here‟s no question in my mind that [Bido] was not truthful with me” when he testified at the postconviction-relief hearing.', 'The trial justice held that the primary responsibility for the complained-of delay in this case was attributable to Bido. Although the trial justice recognized that “[t]here‟s no question that [the state] could have done a better job” processing this case, he nevertheless was “convinced that the primary paramount cause of this delay was the conduct of Mr. Bido.”', 'The trial justice briefly discussed the prejudice factor of the speedy-trial framework. He acknowledged that Bido had identified two specific instances of prejudice allegedly flowing from the delay: (1) the 1991 notes of a police officer who testified at Bido‟s trial had been lost; and (2) Bido was unable to locate a potential witness or suspect in Confessor‟s murder, a man he referred to as “Giovanni.” However, the trial justice concluded that “the reason for the delay is clearly and primarily attributed to [Bido] and as a result of that any prejudice that he might suffer is of his own doing.”', 'The trial justice concluded that Bido‟s speedy-trial claim was without merit. Accordingly, the trial justice found that Bido‟s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel similarly was doomed, stating that “because [Bido] was solely responsible for the delay, one cannot attribute to his attorney any failure to be effective for not raising” the speedy-trial issue. Bido timely appealed.', '-8-', 'Standard of Review', 'The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10 is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant‟s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.” Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 1016 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 192 (R.I. 2008)). When reviewing the grant or denial of postconviction relief, the hearing justice‟s factual findings and credibility determinations will be upheld “absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 313 (R.I. 2009)); see Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 17 n.11 (R.I. 2012) (“This Court will not disturb * * * credibility determinations by a postconviction-relief hearing justice unless the [applicant] „demonstrate[s] by a preponderance of the evidence that the [hearing] justice was clearly wrong.‟” quoting Fontaine v. State, 602 A.2d 521, 526 (R.I. 1992)). At the same time, we review “questions of fact concerning infringement of constitutional rights, and mixed questions of law and fact with constitutional implications, de novo.” Sosa, 949 A.2d at 1016; see also Lynch, 13 A.3d at 605. When conducting our de novo review, however, we nonetheless accord “great deference” to the hearing justice‟s “[f]indings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts.” Hazard v. State, 968 A.2d 886, 891 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 85 (R.I. 2007)).', 'Analysis', 'Bido‟s sole contention on appeal is that the trial justice erred in denying his postconviction-relief claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'In assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we employ the familiar two-pronged standard enunciated in', '-9- Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984). Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011); Lynch, 13 A.3d at 605.', 'First, the applicant must establish that counsel‟s performance was constitutionally deficient; “[t]his requires [a] showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the „counsel‟ guaranteed * * * by the Sixth Amendment.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610 (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 522 (R.I. 1999)).', 'In determining whether this first hurdle has been surmounted, we scrutinize the performance of counsel in a “highly deferential” manner, Lynch, 13 A.3d at 606, affording counsel “a strong presumption that counsel‟s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610. “Second, the applicant must show that he was prejudiced by this deficient performance.” Lynch, 13 A.3d at 605. To satisfy this prong, the applicant must “prove, by a „probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome[,]‟ that „but for counsel‟s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.‟” Id. at 605-06 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).', 'The primary focus of Bido‟s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel in Superior Court—and his sole focus on appeal—was defense counsel‟s failure to seek dismissal of the indictment based on the denial of his right to a speedy trial. Therefore, before we can decide whether Bido has met either prong of the Strickland standard, we first evaluate the merits of Bido‟s speedy-trial claim. It is to this matter that we now turn.', 'I', 'Speedy Trial', 'A criminal defendant‟s right to a speedy trial emanates from the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution. State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 317 (R.I. 2008). As the United States Supreme Court has observed:', '- 10 -', '“The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility', 'of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but', 'nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an', 'accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life', 'caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.”', 'United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S. 302, 311 (1986) (quoting', 'United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 8 (1982)).', 'To assess the merits of a speedy-trial claim, this Court uses Barker‟s four-factor framework. State v. Crocker, 767 A.2d 88, 91 (R.I. 2001). We examine “(1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for delay, (3) the defendant‟s assertion of his [or her] rights, and (4) the prejudice to the accused.” Id. (quoting State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 683 (R.I. 1999)). In conducting our analysis, we carefully weigh “each factor, with no single one being wholly dispositive.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 317 (quoting State v. DeAngelis, 658 A.2d 7, 11 (R.I. 1995)). Under this framework, we are convinced that Bido‟s speedy-trial claim is without merit.', 'The first factor in the framework “is a threshold consideration that triggers review of the remaining factors only if the delay is long enough to be considered „presumptively prejudicial.‟” Crocker, 767 A.2d at 91-92 (quoting Austin, 731 A.2d at 683). “We have held that the line that demarks the „presumptively prejudicial‟ boundary may be drawn at twelve months.” State v. Powers, 643 A.2d 827, 831 (R.I. 1994).', 'Bido contends, and the state concedes, that for speedy-trial purposes the delay in this case—over fourteen years, from Bido‟s arrest in July 1991 to the commencement of Bido‟s trial in May 2006—is presumptively prejudicial, thereby triggering the remainder of the Barker analysis.', 'The second Barker factor requires us to determine the reason for the delay. Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 317. In most cases, each side bears at least some responsibility for pretrial delay. Austin, 731 A.2d at 684; Powers, 643 A.2d at 831. This case is no exception. Resolution of the second factor requires us to “balance the culpability of the parties in causing the delay.” Austin,', '- 11 - 731 A.2d at 684 (quoting Powers, 643 A.2d at 831); see also Vermont v. Brillon, 556 U.S. 81, 90 (2009) (“[I]n applying Barker, we have asked „whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.‟” quoting Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 651 (1992)).', 'In determining each party‟s relative responsibility for the delay, we remain mindful that “[d]ifferent reasons for delay are assigned different weights.” Austin, 731 A.2d at 683; see also Powers, 643 A.2d at 831. With respect to the state‟s responsibility, at one end of the culpability spectrum lies “intentional attempts to delay trial to gain a tactical advantage over a defendant[, which] weigh heavily against the prosecution.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 317. At the other extreme, we recognize that “pretrial delay is often both inevitable and wholly justifiable,” Doggett, 505 U.S. at 656, and that “a valid reason, such as a missing witness, should serve to justify appropriate delay.” Powers, 643 A.2d at 831 (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 531). Between these poles, “official negligence in bringing an accused to trial occupies the middle ground.” Doggett, 505 U.S. at 656-57. “Although negligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than a deliberate intent to harm the accused‟s defense, it still falls on the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it has begun.” Id. at 657.', 'Finally, with respect to a defendant‟s responsibility for the delay, a criminal defendant is not entitled to have things both ways; the accused “cannot take advantage of a delay for which he or she is responsible, whether caused by action or inaction on his or her part, and that factor will weigh against him or her in the balance.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 317; see also Brillon, 556 U.S. at 90 (“[D]elay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant[.]”). The Supreme Court has explained that, “[j]ust as a State‟s „deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the [State],‟ * * * so too should a defendant‟s', '- 12 - deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings be weighted heavily against the defendant.” Brillon, 556 U.S. at 93-94 (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 531).', 'In this case, the trial justice, after finding that Bido was not a credible witness, concluded that Bido‟s conduct was the primary cause of the complained-of delay. This finding largely rested on the fact that, in his 2005 affidavit, Bido acknowledged that he was made aware of the indictment in 1996 but nonetheless refused voluntarily to return to this jurisdiction to face the charges. Additionally, the trial justice deemed Bido‟s decision to fight extradition in 2005 to be consistent with his overall efforts to avoid standing trial on the indictment. The trial justice‟s conclusion is fully consistent with this Court‟s speedy-trial jurisprudence. See, e.g., State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 195 (R.I. 2003) (affirming the denial of the defendant‟s speedy trial claim because, among other reasons, the trial justice correctly referred to the fact that the defendant “for a time had refused to cooperate in the attempt by Rhode Island authorities to have him transferred to Rhode Island pursuant to the [Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act]”); Crocker, 767 A.2d at 91-94 (affirming the trial justice‟s determination that the defendant‟s conduct was the primary cause of the delay in a case in which the defendant remained absent from the jurisdiction for sixteen years, despite knowing of the existence of an outstanding arrest warrant, and did not voluntarily return to Rhode Island); see also United States v. Manning, 56 F.3d 1188, 1195 (9th Cir. 1995) (“If the delay can be attributed to Manning himself, he will be deemed to have waived his speedy trial rights entirely. * * * Manning cannot avoid a speedy trial by forcing the government to run the gauntlet of obtaining formal extradition and then complain about the delay that he has caused by refusing to return voluntarily to the United States.”); United States v. Thirion, 813 F.2d 146, 154 (8th Cir. 1987) (“Thirion attempts to attribute the ninety-two-day delay between his arrest in Monaco and his arraignment in the United States to the government.', '- 13 - Thirion contends that he attempted to waive extradition and return to the United States. His contention is supported only by his own testimony and is inconsistent with his flight to Europe, decision to remain abroad when he learned of the indictment against him and his strong reliance on the terms of the extradition. Absent evidence of any formal waiver of extradition, we are unwilling to attribute to the government any delay caused by formal extradition proceedings initiated in compliance with the treaty.”).', 'In Crocker, 767 A.2d at 92-94, the defendant was brought to trial sixteen years after he was indicted. Nonetheless, the trial justice found, and we agreed, that the “primary reason” for the delay was “that [the defendant] deliberately failed to appear for his pretrial conference date after receiving notice to do so. Thereafter, he remained outside this jurisdiction on the lam from an outstanding arrest warrant that he knew the court had issued after he failed to appear for his scheduled 1981 trial.” Id. at 92.', 'In this case, Bido, like the defendant in Crocker, purposefully remained outside the state‟s jurisdiction despite actual knowledge of the charges pending against him. Beginning with his “classic flight” on the day of Confessor‟s brutal murder, Bido took several steps to avoid facing trial: he refused Morowitz‟s offer to cooperate against the other perpetrators and was informed that he would be prosecuted for murder; he married Colon in an apparent attempt to prevent her from testifying against him; he lived at an assortment of New York addresses, almost all of which were in someone else‟s name; he refused to return to Rhode Island after his 1996 arrest when he learned that the indictment was pending; he fought extradition to Rhode Island in 2005; and, on the eve of trial, he sought a continuance to secure new counsel after learning that Colon was on her way from New York to testify against him. These facts provide ample support', '- 14 - for the trial justice‟s conclusion that the delay in this case largely can be attributed to Bido‟s own avoidance efforts.', 'To be sure, the state is not blameless; fourteen years elapsed between Bido‟s indictment and his trial, and the state has offered scant explanation for this delay, beyond simply pointing to Bido‟s conduct. Indeed, the trial justice recognized that “[t]here‟s no question that [the state] could have done a better job,” and the state, for its part, concedes that the pace of Bido‟s prosecution hardly was exemplary. Nevertheless, the trial justice found that the lion‟s share of the responsibility for the delay rested at Bido‟s feet. We agree with this conclusion.', 'In Crocker, 767 A.2d at 91-92, the state, as a result of apparent oversight, failed to execute an outstanding arrest warrant for the defendant for a period of sixteen years, despite knowing of an out-of-state address for the defendant. We nonetheless affirmed the trial justice‟s finding that the defendant, by virtue of his willful and deliberate evasive actions, was more culpable than the state for causing the delay. Id. at 93-94. We explained that:', '“The mere fact that the state negligently allowed [the defendant] to', 'get away with his evasive conduct for so many years does not', 'excuse him from intentionally refusing to appear for his pretrial', 'conference in the first place and then, for the next sixteen plus', 'years, failing to return to Rhode Island to face the criminal charges', 'that „he knew, * * * or should have known‟ were still pending', 'against him.” Id. at 94.', 'Our reasoning in Crocker fully applies to this case: although the state was negligent in failing to pursue Bido once he fled Rhode Island, that negligence does not excuse Bido‟s pattern of evasive conduct. The trial justice gave full consideration to the relative responsibility of the', '- 15 - state and Bido for this long period of delay. We agree with the trial justice‟s apportionment of culpability.6 The second Barker factor therefore weighs against Bido.', 'Turning to the third factor—the defendant‟s assertion of the right to a speedy trial— “[w]hen assessing a defendant‟s assertion of his [or her] right to a speedy trial, this Court looks for actions sufficiently aggressive to constitute the equivalent of „banging on the courthouse doors.‟” Crocker, 767 A.2d at 94 (quoting Austin, 731 A.2d at 684). Bido‟s conduct in this case in no way approaches pounding, or even tapping, on the courthouse doors; in fact, Bido consistently sought to avoid prosecution.', 'Bido contends that he cannot be faulted for failing to assert his right to a speedy trial because he had “no reason after his release in 1991 to expect that the [s]tate intended to prosecute him.” This argument contradicts the findings of the trial justice that in 1991 Morowitz told him that he would be prosecuted for murder and that in 1996 he again was made aware that the Rhode Island charges were pending. The facts, as found by the trial justice, establish that Bido had actual knowledge of the Rhode Island charges for at least some, if not all, of the long period of delay. This fact is significant when assessing the third Barker factor.', 'In Crocker, 767 A.2d at 94, we held that:', '“[A] legally prudent person who faces criminal charges and who', 'has deliberately avoided a trial date and ignored an outstanding', 'arrest warrant is well advised to assert his or her right to a speedy', 'trial—if he or she wishes to preserve that right[—by] loudly', 'knocking on the courthouse door and demanding a speedy trial.', 'This is especially true if a defendant is on notice that a warrant for', 'his or her arrest is outstanding.” 6', 'At one point in his bench decision, the trial justice remarked that Bido was “solely responsible” for the delay. However, the trial justice noted that “[t]here‟s no question that [the state] could have done a better job” in processing the case, and he repeatedly explained that Bido‟s conduct was the “primary” or “paramount” reason for the delay. We therefore agree with so much of the trial justice‟s decision that allocates some responsibility for the delay to the state, while finding that most of that responsibility rests with Bido.', '- 16 - This Court rejected “Crocker‟s „no news is good news‟ stance, pursuant to which, he says, he just assumed after a while that the charges no longer were pending.” Id. at 95. Similarly, in Doggett, 505 U.S. at 650, a case involving a delay of more than eight years between indictment and arrest, the Supreme Court remarked that, had the defendant known of his indictment during that time, “Barker‟s third factor, concerning invocation of the right to a speedy trial, would be weighed heavily against him.” Id. at 653.', 'Doggett and Crocker therefore compel the conclusion that the third factor must weigh heavily against Bido, because the facts found by the trial justice establish that Bido knew of the pending Rhode Island charges and nevertheless failed to demand a speedy trial or otherwise assert that right in any way.', 'Finally, with respect to the fourth factor in the speedy-trial framework—prejudice to the defendant—the Supreme Court has “identified three types of prejudice that the right to a speedy trial was designed to prevent: oppressive pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern of the defendant, and impairment of the ability to present a defense.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 319. Of the three, “[t]he latter concern is the most important „because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.‟” Id. (quoting DeAngelis, 658 A.2d at 12). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has recognized that “affirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim” because “excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify.” Doggett, 505 U.S. at 655.', 'Here, Bido makes no assertion that the first two types of prejudice apply in his case. Apart from the approximately four months he spent confined in New York City after his July 1991 arrest, Bido was not confined on this charge again until 2005. Therefore, any oppressive', '- 17 - pretrial confinement is entirely absent from this case. Additionally, Bido hardly can assert that he suffered much anxiety and concern as a result of these pending charges; he testified that he lived and worked in New York purportedly unaware, until 2005, of the ghost of Confessor‟s murder. Thus, the only type of prejudice Bido plausibly can claim is the impairment of his ability to present a defense.', 'In the course of this case,7 Bido has identified two instances of specific prejudice: (1) the 1991 notes of a testifying police officer had been lost; and (2) a possible witness or suspect in the Confessor murder—a man referred to only as “Giovanni”—could not be located. Additionally, Bido argues that the sheer length of delay in this case justifies a presumption of prejudice. We are unconvinced.', 'With respect to the lost police notes, Bido has given us nothing to suggest how the loss of the notes caused him any prejudice. The police officer testified at trial and was subjected to extensive voir dire on Bido‟s motion to suppress his statements, and the officer testified that he vividly remembered the circumstances of Bido‟s arrest and interview in New York. Bido, 941 A.2d at 834-37. During the suppression hearing, Bido “put forth no evidence that contradicted [the officer‟s] account of the circumstances that preceded [Bido‟s] statement.” Id. at 836. Bido has similarly failed to provide us with any indication of how the missing notes caused him any 7', 'On appeal, Bido equates the “prejudice to the accused” factor of the speedy-trial framework to the prejudice prong of the Strickland standard. These inquiries, while both employing the term “prejudice,” are very different: the fourth Barker factor examines how the delay has prejudiced the accused in terms of the three specific types of prejudice and any presumptive prejudice that may arise from excessive delay, Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 654-56 (1992), while the prejudice prong of the Strickland inquiry examines whether the allegedly constitutionally deficient performance of counsel caused the result of the proceeding to be different from what it would have been if counsel‟s performance was within the bounds of what is constitutionally permissible, Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605-06 (R.I. 2011). However, notwithstanding Bido‟s error, we briefly address the types of prejudice alleged below by appointed counsel and mentioned by Bido on appeal under his discussion of the first Barker factor.', '- 18 - prejudice. With respect to the infamous “Giovanni,”8 we are troubled by the wholly undeveloped and unsubstantiated nature of Bido‟s argument that, because of the delay, he cannot now locate a purportedly crucial witness—or perhaps even a potential suspect—whom, after all, he can identify only on a first-name basis. Cf. Crocker, 767 A.2d at 95 (“Crocker never presented evidence that would lead us to believe that any of his proposed character witnesses—all of whom allegedly were unavailable or unable to testify at his 1997 trial because of the delay—were of critical importance to his case. In fact, Crocker never took advantage of the trial justice‟s offer to give him „a reasonable amount of time‟ to produce „either the original witnesses‟ or „more contemporary or perhaps more probative witnesses,‟ thereby further indicating to the trial court and to us that, in all likelihood, no material character witnesses existed.”).', 'Moreover, although the trial justice acknowledged Bido‟s bare contentions of prejudice, he concluded that, because Bido‟s conduct was the primary reason for the delay, any prejudice that might have been suffered must be laid at his feet. We deem this conclusion to be correct. See Crocker, 767 A.2d at 96 (explaining, in the course of rejecting the defendant‟s speedy-trial claim, that “Crocker, unlike the defendant in Doggett, intentionally avoided returning to this jurisdiction to face the charges that he knew or should have known were still pending against him—and thus was himself largely responsible for the delay in his eventual trial”). Therefore, we weigh the fourth factor against Bido.', 'After carefully assaying each Barker factor, we are convinced that any speedy-trial claim that Bido might have raised at his trial would have been without merit. 8', 'While the transcript below—as well as Bido on appeal—refers to this man as “Giovanni,” Bido‟s memorandum supporting his amended application for postconviction relief refers to this man as “Jovanny” and “Shorty.” We also note that, when he was arrested in 1991, Bido told New York authorities that he had loaned his car to a friend named “Yovanny” knowing that Yovanny would be using the vehicle in a robbery. Bido, 941 A.2d at 827. Thus, though not clear, we will consider that “Giovanni” and “Yovanny” are one and the same.', '- 19 -', 'II', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'Having evaluated the merits of Bido‟s underlying speedy-trial claim, we now turn to Bido‟s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. We are convinced that the trial justice properly denied this claim.', 'Because our analysis leads us to conclude that Bido‟s speedy-trial claim would not have been successful, defense counsel‟s failure to move for dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial grounds was not constitutionally deficient. Moreover, even if defense counsel‟s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, Bido‟s claim cannot surmount the prejudice prong of Strickland; because Bido‟s speedy-trial contention, if raised, ultimately would have proven unsuccessful, he cannot show that the result of the proceeding against him would have been different.', 'Accordingly, the trial justice‟s denial of Bido‟s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel was correct.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment below.

The plaintiff, Maria Carbone (plaintiff), appeals from the Superior Court‟s entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, John Ward, the finance director for the Town of Lincoln, and the Town of Lincoln (town) (collectively, defendants). Having reviewed the memoranda submitted by the parties and after the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide this case without further briefing or argument. We affirm.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 3, 2008, plaintiff sent a notice of claim to the town for injuries she sustained on March 31, 2008, alleging that “the street collapsed under her, causing her to fall into a large sink hole.” The place of incident was described as a “[s]idewalk and street outside of the Coventry Credit Union at the corner of Railroad Street and Summer Street.” The notice stated that plaintiff “sustained serious personal injury due to this incident” and faulted defendants “for failure to properly maintain said area, resulting in a hazardous condition which injured Ms.', '-1- Carbone.” On April 11, 2008, plaintiff sent a second notice, indicating that the injury occurred when she fell in a hole “on Winter Street parallel to Railroad Street in the Town of Lincoln/Manville, Rhode Island.” The record reflects that the notice of April 3, 2008, which was sent by plaintiff‟s first attorney, may have been incorrect; the April 11, 2008 notice was sent by plaintiff‟s second—and current—attorney.', 'Thereafter, on June 12, 2008, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging that, as a result of the town‟s failure to maintain its sidewalks in a safe condition, plaintiff suffered personal injuries when she fell into “a hole on Winter St., parallel to Railroad St., in Lincoln/Manville, RI.”1 The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the complaint should be dismissed because the notice of the place of injury was insufficient as a matter of law, based on G.L. 1956 §§ 45-15-9 and 45-15-10. The defendants contended that plaintiff misidentified the location where her injury occurred and that her descriptions of the location were inconsistent.', 'A hearing was held in Superior Court on January 12, 2010. The plaintiff argued that the notice was sufficient and, further, that the director of public works for the town acknowledged in an answer to interrogatories that the department had received a call from the Lincoln Police Department concerning plaintiff‟s injury.', 'The plaintiff also argued that pretrial discovery revealed that orange cones had been placed at the scene of the incident and that the town‟s correspondence indicated that an investigation into the injury had been undertaken.', 'These factors, plaintiff contended, established that the town “had notice of where this occurred.” 1', 'The plaintiff later moved to amend her complaint to add the State of Rhode Island (state) as a defendant; that motion was granted on January 15, 2009. In response, the state filed an answer and a cross-claim against the town, denying the allegation contained in the complaint, but alleging that if the state was found liable for plaintiff‟s injuries, then it would be entitled to full indemnification and/or contribution from the town. The defendants similarly filed a cross-claim against the state, asking for indemnification and/or contribution.', '-2- Although plaintiff conceded that the first notice was insufficient, she asserted that proper notice was sent on April 11, 2008. The defendants countered that “actual notice and compliance with [the] statutory prerequisite are two separate things” and that the second notice did not cure the original defect because it “cite[d] the location of the defect as a geographical impossibility.” Indeed, defendants maintained that there was “no such place” as that to which plaintiff referred.', 'The trial justice granted defendants‟ motion for summary judgment, concluding that plaintiff‟s notice of claim failed to comply with the requirements of § 45-15-9. Section 45-15-9 provides in relevant part:', '“(a) A person so injured or damaged shall, within sixty (60) days,', 'give to the town by law obliged to keep the highway, causeway, or', 'bridge in repair, notice of the time, place, and cause of the injury or', 'damage; and if the town does not make just and due satisfaction,', 'within the time prescribed by § 45-15-5, the person shall, within', 'three (3) years after the date of the injury or damage, commence', 'his or her action against the town treasurer for the recovery of', 'damages, and not thereafter.” The trial justice acknowledged plaintiff‟s contentions that the second notice cured the defects in the first notice and that, notwithstanding the written notices, plaintiff‟s argument that the town had actual notice of where the accident happened. He determined, however, that actual notice was not the issue before the court; “[i]t‟s a notice statute and our Supreme Court has declared several times that it‟s to be strictly construed.” The trial justice concluded that the notice did not “provide sufficient detail to make an investigation possible” because the descriptions “excluded the actual area where the accident occurred” and “did not fix the location in a [reasonably] sufficient manner.” The trial justice relied on Moseley v. Fitzgerald, 773 A.2d 254 (R.I. 2001), in which this Court stated that “[i]t is clear that the requirements of § 45-15-9 must be strictly obeyed and that the notice requirement is a „condition precedent to the plaintiff‟s right of action, * * * and may not be waived.‟” Moseley, 773 A.2d at 258 (quoting Morales v. Napolitano, 713', '-3- A.2d 193, 194 (R.I. 1998)). An order and a judgment based on Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure entered on January 21, 2010.', 'The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court and argues that the Superior Court erred in dismissing the complaint based on insufficient notice of injury in accordance with § 45-15-9. In particular, plaintiff contends that the second notice identified the location where the injury occurred as being “on Winter Street parallel to Railroad Street.” According to plaintiff, this constituted sufficient notice and the “minor misidentification” of Winter Street as running parallel to Railroad Street—when, in fact, it is perpendicular to Railroad Street—is of no import because defendants were able to identify the defective condition, as evidenced by the orange cones or barrels a town employee placed at the site.', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews de novo a trial justice‟s decision granting summary judgment.” Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009); see also United Lending Corp. v.

The issue is whether the second notice was a timely amendment of the first notice. In Prout v. City of Providence, 996 A.2d 1139, 1143 (R.I. 2010), this Court considered whether notice under', '-4- § 45-15-9 properly could be amended within the statutory sixty-day period. In that case, we noted that a plaintiff‟s motion to amend her complaint to clarify the location of injury properly was dismissed because “[§] 45-15-9 provides for a sixty day period in which an injured party may file or amend the notice of claim to the city, and that statutory time limit long had expired.” Prout, 996 A.2d at 1143 (emphasis added). Here, plaintiff amended her notice within the statutorily prescribed timeframe and, therefore, we next address whether the second notice complied with the statute.', 'The General Assembly has allowed an injured person to recover for damages arising from a municipality‟s failure to keep its sidewalks in a safe condition.2 General Laws 1956 § 24-5-1. Section 45-15-8 sets forth a mechanism through which injured citizens may recover for their losses in cases in which the injury could have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care.3 However, a citizen may recover only in accordance with a strict statutory scheme that requires sufficient notice of the place of injury and an adequate description of the defect that caused the injury.

This requirement on the part of the General Assembly may result in harsh consequences and preclude the resolution of a valid claim in our courts.', '“The notice requirement set forth in § 45-15-9 is intended to facilitate timely and efficient investigation into a municipality‟s liability.” Prout, 996 A.2d at 1142-43. Although the notice need not “fix the exact location of the defect,” it must describe the setting in a “reasonably sufficient manner.” Lahaye v. City of Providence, 640 A.2d 978, 980 (R.I. 1994) (citing Malo v. McAloon, 65 R.I. 26, 31, 13 A.2d 245, 247 (1940)); see Mushnick v. City of Providence, 692 A.2d 700, 700 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)

In Prout, for example, this Court deemed insufficient a notice that “merely recited that [a plaintiff] „was at or near Glenham Street‟” when she was injured because “[t]he phrase „at or near‟ is vague and imprecise and does not describe the location of the injury in any meaningful way.” Id.

In this case, plaintiff failed accurately to describe the place of injury. The first notice incorrectly described a “[s]idewalk and street outside of the Coventry Credit Union at the corner of Railroad Street and Summer Street.” The second notice stated that plaintiff fell in a hole “on Winter Street parallel to Railroad Street in the Town of Lincoln/Manville, Rhode Island.” Although the statute does not require “complete accuracy,” this notice is deficient in more than one respect and neither the first nor the second notice identifies the location of the defect in a reasonably sufficient manner.', 'Furthermore, even if plaintiff correctly had described the streets as perpendicular, the notice nevertheless fails to meet the “reasonably sufficient” standard articulated by this Court because it fails to specify on which of the four corners of that cross-section of streets the injury was and omits any description of how close to the corner, or how far from Winter Street, the injury occurred. Because the description provided in the notice excluded the actual area where the injury occurred, we agree with the trial justice that “[p]laintiff‟s notice did not fix the location in a [reasonably] sufficient manner.”', 'The statute clearly and unambiguously requires that the notice of claim must be specific, therefore the notice in the case at bar must be deemed insufficient.

118,State of Rhode Island Department of : Environmental Management v. : Administrative Adjudication Division. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The discovery of a catch of flounder that exceeded the allowable limit by thirty-seven pounds has led to a dispute that eventually has wended its way to this Court. On May 22, 2007, the F/V Cracker Jac, owned by Daniel R. Barlow, was tied to the dock at the fishing pier at Point Judith in Narragansett. Two enforcement officers of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) boarded the boat at a time when Barlow was not on board and said they discovered that the amount of summer flounder he had caught that day was more than was permitted under the applicable regulations. A notice of violation followed, and a trail of litigation ensued that now terminates in this Court.', 'Barlow seeks review by way of certiorari of a judgment of the Superior Court that reversed a hearing officer’s decision and reinstated DEM’s decision, which found Barlow ineligible to participate in its 2010 Summer Flounder Sector Allocation Pilot Program (pilot program). That agency determined that Barlow was ineligible to participate in the pilot program because of a previous consent agreement he had entered into with the department.', 'The', '-1- agreement reflected a settlement of the above-mentioned allegation that Barlow had violated a state marine fisheries regulation for catch limits.', 'The DEM contended that the consent agreement was an administrative penalty that justified disqualifying Barlow from participating in the pilot program. On appeal from the Administrative Adjudication Division of DEM (AAD), a justice of the Superior Court agreed. Barlow then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted on June 8, 2011.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 27, 2012, based on an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts underlying this controversy are not subject to significant dispute. On May 22, 2007, DEM law enforcement officers alleged that Barlow violated Rhode Island Marine Fisheries Regulation § 7.7.2-2 by landing 137 pounds of summer flounder, which exceeded the 100-pound limit. 1 DEM sent Barlow a notice of violation, informing him thereby that any and all of his commercial fishing licenses would be suspended for a period of thirty days because of the violation. Barlow appealed that order of suspension and requested a hearing before the AAD. In mid-December of 2008, without engaging in any adjudicative process, Barlow and DEM settled the matter, and they entered into a consent agreement, concurring that Barlow’s 1', 'The thirty-seven pound overage that Barlow allegedly landed amounted to five to eight fish.', '-2- commercial fishing licenses would be suspended for a period of ten days, that he would be absolved of any liability arising from the alleged violation, and that if Barlow violated a fishing regulation in the future, DEM would impose a “first tier” penalty upon him, as if it were his first violation. Additionally, the parties agreed that the consent agreement “shall have the full force and effect of a final administrative adjudication, shall be deemed a final administrative decision * * * and shall be fully enforceable in the Superior Court.” 2', 'In 2010, Barlow applied to participate in DEM’s Summer Flounder Sector Allocation Pilot Program, that would have allowed a daily catch of between 500 and 1,500 pounds of summer flounder. That program would be lucrative for the fishermen, and Barlow expected to earn between $30,000 and $40,000 by engaging in it. However, in a letter dated June 15, 2010, DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife informed Barlow that he was ineligible to take part in the pilot program because he had been assessed an administrative penalty for violating a state marine fisheries regulation within the previous three years, referring to the 2008 consent agreement. Barlow appealed the denial of his application to the AAD; a hearing was held on September 8, 2010. The AAD reversed the decision of DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife, finding that the consent agreement was not an administrative penalty because it absolved Barlow of all liability arising from the alleged violation of May 22, 2007. The AAD directed DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife to allow Barlow to participate in the pilot program. The DEM then appealed the decision of the AAD to the Superior Court under the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42, and the court granted a stay of the AAD’s decision. A hearing was held on February 18, 2011. 2', 'The consent agreement is attached to this opinion.', '-3-', 'The trial justice sustained the appeal of the agency. In his decision, the trial justice held that the AAD had erred when it concluded that the consent agreement was not an administrative penalty. In doing so, he reasoned that the consent agreement had the same legal effect as an order issued based on an administrative adjudication. He based that finding on language in the consent agreement that stated that it “shall have the full force and effect of a final administrative adjudication, shall be deemed a final administrative decision * * * and shall be fully enforceable in the Superior Court * * *.” The trial justice also held that the denial of Barlow’s application to participate in the pilot program was not an ex post facto law, nor did it result in an excessive penalty. Accordingly, he reinstated DEM’s decision denying Barlow’s application. Barlow then sought review in this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court, in reviewing cases brought under the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42, is limited to reviewing questions of law.” Foster-Glocester Regional School Committee v.

This is so because the program in which Barlow was denied participation ended on December 31, 2010. This Court has held that “[a] case is moot if it raised a justiciable controversy at the time the complaint was filed, but events occurring after the filing have deprived the litigant of an ongoing stake in the controversy.” City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers' District Council Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Seibert v. Clark, 619 A.2d 1108, 1110 (R.I. 1993)). Barlow concedes that the matter before us is in fact moot because the pilot program in which he was denied participation no longer exists. However, he argues that this case fits squarely within the so-called “extreme public importance” exception to the mootness doctrine, which we have recognized in the past. See id."", ""The exception has a two-pronged test. First, a petitioner must demonstrate that the case is of “extreme public importance.” Rhode Island Laborers' District Council Local 1033, 960 A.2d at 533. Circumstances that satisfy this first prong “will usually implicate ‘important"", ""-5- constitutional rights, matters concerning a person's livelihood, or matters concerning citizen voting rights.’” Id. at 533-34 (quoting Cicilline v. Almond, 809 A.2d 1101, 1106 (R.I. 2002)). Second, the petitioner must demonstrate that “the controversy is capable of repetition and will evade review.” Unistrut Corp. v. State Department of Labor and Training, 922 A.2d 93, 99 (R.I. 2007) (citing Krivitsky v. Town of Westerly, 823 A.2d 1144, 1146-47 (R.I. 2003))."", 'Without question, this matter concerns the livelihood of Barlow, as well as other fishermen who may be denied participation in similar fishing programs or may be denied fishing licenses altogether because of alleged past transgressions that were resolved by consent agreements. It is not seriously disputed that Barlow’s exclusion from the pilot program by DEM denied him the opportunity to earn a substantial amount of money. In our opinion, the facts of this case are sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the mootness exception.', 'Turning to the second, it is our further opinion that this controversy is capable of repetition, because DEM could reinitiate the pilot program or begin a similar program at any point in time. As is implicit in its name, this was a “pilot” program, indicating that there is a likelihood that others will follow. There is certainly the potential that DEM could exclude from these programs anyone who has ever been assessed an administrative penalty. As a result, Barlow and other similarly situated fishermen might never be allowed to participate in such programs. Accordingly, it is clear to us that the present controversy is “capable of repetition.”', 'Finally, these cases almost certainly will evade review because of the short duration of the programs involved. The 2010 pilot program ran for only eight months. It would be highly unlikely that an applicant could fully litigate any matter concerning such a program before it expired, as was the case with Barlow. In consideration of the foregoing, we shall address the', '-6- merits of the matter because it is of extreme public importance and capable of repetition yet evading review.', 'B', 'Denial of Barlow’s Application to Participate in the Pilot Program', 'Barlow was excluded from participating in the pilot program because of the consent agreement that he entered into with DEM.', 'This Court applies the principles of contract interpretation when reviewing a consent agreement. See Durfee v. Ocean State Steel, Inc., 636 A.2d 698, 703 (R.I. 1994) (holding that even after a consent agreement was adopted by a court, it was “in the nature of a solemn contract” and was “‘to be construed as a contract using the rules of construction applicable thereto’”, quoting Trahan v. Trahan, 455 A.2d 1307, 1310 (R.I. 1983) and Black’s Law Dictionary 410-11 (6th ed. 1990)).', 'The consent agreement says that if Barlow “violate[s] a Rhode Island statute or regulation governing the taking of seafood products,” after the agreement’s execution date, DEM “shall not impose a second tier penalty” as would be administered for second offenses but, instead, “shall impose a first tier penalty” as if it were a first offense. See DEM Commercial License Suspension and Revocation Regulations, Rule 6.', 'Furthermore, it is meaningful that nowhere in the consent agreement does Barlow admit to any guilt or liability about the alleged violation. To the contrary, the consent agreement is crystal clear in its provision that it “shall operate to absolve [Barlow] from any liability arising for all violations alleged by [DEM] relative to the” inspection of Barlow’s boat on May 22, 2007. (Emphases added.). Black’s Law Dictionary 8 (9th ed. 2009) defines the word “absolve” to mean “[t]o release from an obligation, debt, or responsibility.” In sum, the agreement cannot properly be read as imposing liability for conduct when it specifically frees him from it.', '-7-', 'As the AAD opinion says, “where a party is ‘absolved’ from all liability regarding one incident, he cannot then be subject to future consequences in another incident to which he and [DEM] have not otherwise expressly agreed.” The consent agreement, by its terms, was meant to be a “resolution of all disputed issues in th[e] matter.” Barlow fulfilled all of his obligations and fully complied with the terms of the agreement, yet DEM failed to uphold its end of the bargain when it imposed additional consequences to which Barlow did not agree. Thus, DEM wrongly used the consent agreement as a reason to bar him from the program. 3', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.

119,Kimberly Lomastro : v. : Margaret Iacovelli et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Kimberly Lomastro, appeals from a decision of the Superior Court that granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment. She argues that the trial justice erred when he denied her motion to amend her complaint. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 31, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Lomastro was employed as a bus driver for Durham School Services (Durham), a bus company that contracted to provide transportation for the Town of Johnston School Department (school department).', 'On January 18, 2008, while she was driving a bus that was full of', '-1- elementary-school children, plaintiff reported over the radio that someone had shot at her bus and that panic had spread among the children. After an investigation was completed, the school department found itself displeased with the manner in which plaintiff had handled the situation. The school department concluded that plaintiff had no basis for broadcasting that the bus had been struck by gunfire, that her actions caused a panic on her bus and to occupants of other busses listening in on the radio, that she had demonstrated that she was unable to keep control of the children, and that she had failed to maintain radio contact after making her initial report.', 'Based on these findings and citing a specific provision in its contract with Durham, 1 the school department sent a letter requesting that plaintiff no longer be assigned to transport Johnston students.2 Eventually, plaintiff left her employment with Durham 3 and, as a result, plaintiff filed suit for wrongful termination against Margaret Iacovelli, the then-superintendent of Johnston public schools, and David Cournoyer, the director of facilities and transportation for Johnston public schools (collectively defendants).', 'The complaint alleged that defendants wrongfully had requested that plaintiff be terminated from her employment at Durham and it asked that judgment be entered against them.', 'In due course, and after some discovery had been conducted, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment in the Superior Court, and a hearing was held on August 22, 2011. At the hearing, counsel conceded that plaintiff had been an employee of Durham, and not the Town of Johnston. He argued, however, that Johnston was plaintiff’s “de facto employer” and that 1', 'This section of the contract, entitled “Driver Withdrawal,” says: “It is understood that the Superintendent of Schools or designee reserves the right to withdraw, with or without cause, at any time, their approval of any driver. The contractor will immediately upon receipt thereof replace the driver.” 2', 'Durham also issued plaintiff a warning for carelessness in communicating over the radio that her bus was shot at and for not using her cell phone to contact Durham. 3', 'The record is unclear about whether plaintiff left her employment with Durham voluntarily or not and this is a disputed issue among the parties.', '-2- summary judgment should not be granted in defendants’ favor. The trial justice did not agree; he ruled that because there was no employer-employee relationship between plaintiff and the Town of Johnston, no viable claim existed for wrongful termination against the municipality, and he granted the town’s motion for summary judgment.', 'During the course of the hearing, however, the trial justice suggested that a claim of tortious interference with a contractual relationship may have been a more appropriate cause of action than the wrongful-termination claim that plaintiff actually filed. Heeding the trial justice’s remarks, counsel made an oral motion for leave to amend the complaint to include a claim of tortious interference, to which defendants objected. The trial justice sustained the objection, however, concluding that it would be unfair to defendants if he allowed plaintiff to amend her complaint and mold a claim around his comments. The plaintiff timely appealed. Before this Court, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice wrongfully granted summary judgment against her and that he further erred when he denied her motion to amend her complaint.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment on a de novo basis.” Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 966 A.2d 1262, 1267 (R.I. 2009). “We will affirm such a decision only if ‘after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Lucier v. Impact Recreation, Ltd., 864 A.2d 635, 638 (R.I. 2005). Moreover, the party opposing “a motion for summary judgment carries the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of', '-3- fact and cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions.” United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 631 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1225 (R.I. 1996)).', 'Additionally, “the decision to grant or to deny a motion to amend a complaint is confided to the sound discretion of the [trial] justice.” Harodite Industries, Inc. v. Warren Electric Corp., 24 A.3d 514, 529 (R.I. 2011). “Accordingly, we afford ‘great deference to the trial justice’s ruling on a motion to amend,’” and we “will not disturb [that] ruling unless the [trial] justice committed an abuse of discretion.” Id. (quoting Catucci v. Pacheco, 866 A.2d 509, 513 (R.I. 2005) and Barrette v. Yakavonis, 966 A.2d 1231, 1236 (R.I. 2009)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred because he declined to grant her leave to amend her complaint. Rule 15(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that after a responsive pleading is served, a party may amend a “pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party.” 4 However, the rule, and our consistent case law, make it clear that “leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.” Id.; see, e.g., Medeiros v. Cornwall, 911 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 2006). Furthermore, we have “consistently held that trial justices should liberally allow amendments to the pleadings.” Medeiros, 911 A.2d at 253 (quoting Serra v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 463 A.2d 142, 150 (R.I. 1983)). See also Ricard v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 113 R.I. 528, 540, 324 A.2d 671, 677 (1974) (“The true 4', 'Rule 15(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to amend a pleading without leave of court once “before a responsive pleading is served,” or “at any time within 20 days after” being served “if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar.” However, because this case does not involve either of these situations, leave of court was required before plaintiff could amend her complaint.', '-4- spirit of the rule is exemplified in the words ‘* * * and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.’”).', 'We previously have cited with approval the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which contains language that parallels that of our state rule. 5 Medeiros, 911 A.2d at 253-54; see also Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). In Foman, 371 U.S. at 182, the Court said:', '“Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend ‘shall be freely', 'given when justice so requires’; this mandate is to be heeded. * * *', 'If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff', 'may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an', 'opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any', 'apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or', 'dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure', 'deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice', 'to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,', 'futility of amendment, etc.—the leave should, as the rules require,', 'be ‘freely given.’ Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity', 'to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright', 'refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing', 'for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of', 'that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal', 'Rules.”', 'In this case, the trial justice only briefly gave his reasoning for denying plaintiff’s motion saying: “I think it is unfair to [defendants][] for me to allow [plaintiff] an opportunity to now consider my comments and file a pleading around” them. In our opinion, this reasoning, in and of itself, is insufficient for denying a motion to amend. In Foman, 371 U.S. at 182, the reasoning of which has been embraced by this Court, the United States Supreme Court delineated reasons that might justify the denial of a motion to amend. See Medeiros, 911 A.2d at 253-54. Although 5', 'Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure says: “[i]n all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.”', '-5- that list is not exhaustive, and other grounds may exist, the trial justice’s reason for denying the motion in this case simply was inadequate absent some additional showing of undue delay, prejudice, bad faith, futility of the amendment or some other compelling reason. See id.', 'This Court held on several occasions that “amendments to pleadings are to be allowed with great liberality absent a showing of extreme prejudice” and the burden of demonstrating such prejudice lies on the party opposing the motion to amend. Kuczer v. City of Woonsocket, 472 A.2d 300, 301 (R.I. 1984); see also Wachsberger v. Pepper, 583 A.2d 77, 78-79 (R.I. 1990) (citing Babbs v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 507 A.2d 1347, 1349 (R.I. 1986)). In this case, counsel for defendants argued that plaintiff’s motion was too “late in the game,” and that it should therefore be denied. However, to deny a motion to amend because of delay, “[t]he trial justice must find that such delay creates substantial prejudice to the opposing party.” 6 Wachsberger, 583 A.2d at 79. Absent such a finding, the denial cannot be upheld. Id.', 'In this case, the parties were not provided with a sufficient opportunity to brief and/or argue whether the motion should be granted or denied and the trial justice made no specific findings. In our opinion, denying the plaintiff’s motion without such findings constituted an abuse of discretion. 6', 'We note that this Court has allowed amendments to pleadings at very late stages of litigation when the opposing party had not demonstrated substantial prejudice. See, e.g., Wachsberger v. Pepper, 583 A.2d 77, 79 (R.I. 1990) (holding that delay of over three years without a showing of prejudice was insufficient to deny motion to amend); Mikaelian v. Drug Abuse Unit, 501 A.2d 721, 722-23 (R.I. 1985) (holding that it was not error to grant motion to amend four years after the suit commenced and one day before the case was scheduled for trial).', '-6-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for a hearing on the plaintiff’s motion to amend and the defendant’s objection thereto.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Kimberly Lomastro v.

120,"Ronald R. Fatulli : v. : Bowen’s Wharf Co., Inc. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Located in the City of Newport, Bowen’s Wharf is a thriving tourist destination that includes an active marina as well as a variety of retailers, restaurants, and art galleries. In this appeal, we are called upon to decide a question that will clarify the rights and obligations of two adjacent landholders whose combined property comprises the entirety of Bowen’s Wharf. The question presented for our review is whether the trial justice erred in finding that a right of first refusal granted to Bowen’s Wharf Company, Inc. (Bowen’s Wharf Company or defendant) by Ronald R. Fatulli (Fatulli or plaintiff) in 1969 has expired by operation of law. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 15, 1969, George H. Piltz deeded the entirety of Bowen’s Wharf to Fatulli and his father, who has since died. That same day, the Fatullis sold defendant a portion of Bowen’s Wharf, known as Parcel B, and retained Parcel A, which is the subject of this litigation. Parcel A is smaller than Parcel B and is situated at the wharf’s western extent, where it juts out into the', '-1- harbor. Parcel B is located on the portion of the wharf closest to Thames Street, which runs north to south along the parcel’s eastern edge.', 'One week later, on August 21, 1969, the parties executed an agreement (Agreement) in which Fatulli granted defendant the right of first refusal on Parcel A. 1 Specifically, Fatulli granted defendant:', '“the right of first refusal to purchase all of that certain lot or parcel', 'of land, with the buildings and improvements thereon, indicated as', 'Parcel ‘A’ on that certain plat entitled ‘Bowen’s Wharf, Thames', 'Street, Newport, Rhode Island’ prepared by Aquidneck Associates,', 'Inc., dated August 4, 1969, Drawing No. 69042, together with the', 'dock adjacent thereto, either separately, or together with the lobster', 'business presently conducted thereon, at the same price and upon', 'the same terms, provisions and conditions as shall be contained in', 'any written bona fide offer for the purchase thereof * * *.” The Agreement was recorded in the land evidence records of the City of Newport on the day it was executed.', 'More than thirty years later, on January 11, 2000, Fatulli filed an action seeking declaratory relief in Newport County Superior Court. He sought a declaration that the right of first refusal in the Agreement had expired by operation of G.L. 1956 § 34-4-26, which governs the expiration of recorded rights affecting real estate. That statute, which was enacted in 1989 (P.L. 1989, ch. 374, § 1), provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“(a) Any recorded contract, deed, or other instrument', 'entered into which creates a * * * right of first refusal to purchase', 'real estate, * * * which by its own terms, does not provide for a', 'specific expiration date, shall expire ten (10) years after the date of', 'execution, or ten (10) years after recording, if no date of execution', 'is contained in the instrument.” Section 34-4-26(a).

Because the Agreement did not provide for a specific expiration date, and because defendant had not filed a Notice of Intention to extend its rights under the Agreement, Fatulli contended that the right of first refusal had expired.', 'In an answer filed on February 3, 2000, defendant raised six affirmative defenses, including laches, waiver, estoppel, and reliance. The defendant also asserted that § 34-4-26 was both inapplicable to the Agreement and unconstitutional.', 'The answer also set forth counterclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendant admitted Fatulli’s allegation that neither party had filed a Notice of Intention prior to July 1, 1991, but denied that § 34-4-26 applied to the Agreement.', 'Thereafter, on April 13, 2000, Fatulli moved for summary judgment. The defendant raised several arguments in opposition to Fatulli’s motion. First, it claimed that factual issues precluded the entry of summary judgment. Second, it argued that § 34-4-26 did not apply because the Agreement included personalty as well as real estate. Finally, it asserted that § 34-4- 26 was unconstitutionally vague, violated the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution, and unconstitutionally affected vested rights.', 'On September 29, 2000, a hearing justice of the Superior Court denied Fatulli’s motion for summary judgment. An order to that effect was entered on October 18, 2000. 2', 'The case came before a justice of the Superior Court for a bench trial on April 20, 2009. 3 Fatulli did not call any witnesses to testify; instead, he rested his case after the Agreement was 2', 'In the interim period between the hearing and entry of the order, on October 5, 2000, Fatulli filed an amended complaint. His amended complaint contained an additional allegation that the right of first refusal in the Agreement violated the Rule Against Perpetuities. 3', 'At the start of the proceedings, the trial justice noted that defendant had challenged the constitutionality of G.L. 1956 § 34-4-26 and inquired whether, pursuant to Rule 24(d) of the', '-3- entered into evidence as a joint exhibit. Before defendant called its witnesses to the stand, two additional exhibits were admitted into evidence: (1) a plan of Bowen’s Wharf; and (2) the deed dated August 15, 1969, in which Piltz granted Bowen’s Wharf to the Fatullis.', 'The defendant called two witnesses: Bartlett S. Dunbar and Ralph Stokes.', 'Dunbar testified that he formed Bowen’s Wharf Company as a development company in 1969. Although his role was not explicitly stated on the record, in an affidavit filed before trial, Dunbar stated that he was the president of Bowen’s Wharf Company. According to Dunbar, he met with Fatulli in the 1990s to discuss “perhaps making an offer on the property [owned by Fatulli].” Dunbar confirmed that he did not make an offer to purchase the property at this meeting, but testified that they discussed the right of first refusal referred to in the Agreement. The trial justice did not allow Dunbar to testify about the substance of that discussion, and noted that such testimony was barred under the statute of frauds and the rules of evidence.', 'The defendant next called Ralph Stokes to the stand. Stokes, an attorney and an expert in the law of titles and real estate conveyances, testified that, among title insurance underwriters, it is “universally agreed” that a right of first refusal without a termination date expires in ten years as to third parties. He also stated that the issue of whether the right expires “as to the parties themselves * * * does not come up * * * frequently, if ever * * *.” Stokes characterized the statute as “badly drafted” and “ambiguous at best,” noting that the statute seemed to invalidate not only rights of first refusal, but also recorded instruments themselves. Finally, Stokes testified that “[t]he right of first refusal in this matter * * * seemed to suggest that it also conveyed a business. That is not * * * an interest in real estate.” Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, it had notified the Attorney General of this challenge. The record reflects that, after a brief recess, a representative of the Attorney General informed the court that “[a]t this time, the Attorney General’s Office has no interest in this case.”', '-4-', 'On cross-examination, Fatulli’s counsel asked Stokes if he “[had] an opinion as to whether or not * * * that right of first refusal, when it was executed in 1969, * * * violate[d] the Rule Against Perpetuities.” Stokes said he did not have an opinion on that, but noted that the Rule Against Perpetuities was “kicked out of Rhode Island law in 1992.” 4', 'After trial, the parties submitted posttrial memoranda, in which they reiterated the arguments set forth at trial and in their pretrial filings. The defendant’s posttrial memorandum included a novel reading of the statute that it had not advanced previously: that § 34-4-26 was a “notice statute” and applied only to third parties. The defendant also expanded upon its defense that § 34-4-26 did not apply to the property referred to in the Agreement. Since that property comprised not only real estate, but also a dock and a lobster business, defendant argued that the statute did not apply to such “mixed property.”', 'In a written decision issued on March 22, 2010, the trial justice found that “the parties’ right of first refusal agreement expired in 1979. Accordingly, [Fatulli] is not obligated to offer Parcel A, the wharf, or the lobster business to [d]efendant in the event of a bona fide third party’s offer.” The trial justice found that § 34-4-26 applied to the subject matter of the Agreement, citing precedent from this Court and other authority for his conclusion that “a wharf or dock may properly be characterized as real property.” The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that § 34-4-26 was a notice statute and, as such, did not apply to extinguish the right granted in the Agreement as between the parties themselves. Judgment for Fatulli was entered on April 20, 2010. Thereafter, defendant timely appealed to this Court. 4', 'In fact, as we note below, the General Assembly modified the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities in 1987 and abolished it altogether in 1999. See infra part IV-C.', '-5-', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The question presented for our review is whether the trial justice erred in finding that the right of first refusal granted in the Agreement between the parties has expired by operation of § 34-4-26. In answering this question, we must address two underlying issues: whether the trial justice erred in (1) finding that § 34-4-26 extinguished defendant’s right of first refusal not only as to Parcel A, but also as to the dock and the lobster business; and (2) declining to characterize § 34-4-26 as a notice statute. Additionally, we address certain policy considerations stemming from the application of § 34-4-26 to this dispute.', 'We note that defendant has abandoned several contentions which it raised before the trial justice and on prebriefing before this Court, including various constitutional challenges to § 34- 4-26 and its application to the Agreement in this case. We analyze only the arguments defendant pressed on full briefing and at oral argument. See State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d 518, 519 n.1 (R.I. 2012) (deeming arguments raised in prebriefing statement but not in full brief to be waived, citing Article I, Rule 16(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure).', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court gives great weight to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil matter * * *.” Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584, 588 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Cahill v. Morrow, 11 A.3d 82, 86 (R.I. 2011)). On appeal, we will leave such findings undisturbed unless they are “clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.” Id. (quoting Cahill, 11 A.3d at 86). By contrast, “we review in a de', '-6- novo manner a trial justice’s rulings concerning questions of law.” Id. (quoting Cahill, 11 A.3d at 86).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Does § 34-4-26 Apply?', 'First, we address defendant’s argument that the terms of § 34-4-26 do not apply to the “mixed property” described in the Agreement.', 'As noted above, the Agreement granted defendant “the right of first refusal to purchase all of that certain lot or parcel of land * * * indicated as Parcel ‘A’ * * * together with the dock adjacent thereto, either separately, or together with the lobster business presently conducted thereon * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Section 34-4-26 applies to “recorded * * * instrument[s]” which “create[ ] * * * a right of first refusal to purchase real estate.” The defendant contends that, because the Agreement granted it a right of first refusal not only on Fatulli’s land, but also on Fatulli’s wharf and lobster business, that right is not one which falls within the embrace of § 34-4-26.', 'Although defendant could have chosen to exercise his right of first refusal (while it was still extant) on (1) the land and the dock; or (2) the land, the dock, and the lobster business, a careful reading of the Agreement shows that it did not grant defendant a right of first refusal on either the lobster business or the dock alone. Rather, the Agreement granted defendant a right of first refusal on the lobster business and the dock only when purchased in conjunction with Parcel A.', 'We agree with the trial justice’s finding that, on these facts, “a wharf or dock may properly be characterized as real property.” We also agree with his finding that “§ 34-4-26’s', '-7- application to the right of first refusal to purchase a parcel of real estate is not fatally diluted by the fact that the right also applies to a business and a wharf.” The trial justice observed that “[d]efendant cited no case law on the proposition that § 34-4-26—or any other statute governing real property—does not apply to ‘mixed transactions.’” Our own review of Rhode Island case law confirms that defendant’s argument on this point is unsupported. Because the right of first refusal granted to defendant in the Agreement falls within the plain terms of the statute, we must reject defendant’s argument that § 34-4-26 does not apply to that right.', 'B', 'Is § 34-4-26 a Notice Statute?', 'The defendant next argues that § 34-4-26 is a notice statute and, as such, operates to extinguish rights of first refusal only as to third parties, not as between the original contracting parties. We believe that the trial justice did not err in declining to characterize § 34-4-26 as a notice statute. Notice statutes distinguish between those with notice of another’s interest in property and those without such notice. 5 See 11 Thompson on Real Property § 92.08(b) at 159- 160 (2d Thomas ed. 1998).', 'Section 34-4-26 cannot—and does not—draw this distinction because it applies only to recorded instruments affecting real estate. The world is therefore on notice of all instruments within the statute’s reach. See G.L. 1956 § 34-13-2 (“A recording * * * shall be constructive notice to all persons of the contents of instruments and other matters so recorded * * *.”); see also Davies v. Little, 111 R.I. 496, 502, 304 A.2d 661, 665 (1973) (recording of agreement granting right of first refusal on property constitutes constructive notice). Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s finding that § 34-4-26 is not a notice statute. 5', 'Rhode Island’s recording act, G.L. 1956 § 34-11-1, is a notice statute. It provides in pertinent part that: “[e]very conveyance of lands * * * shall be void unless * * * recorded * * *; provided, however, that the conveyance, if delivered, as between the parties, * * * or those having notice thereof, shall be valid and binding though not acknowledged or recorded.” (Emphases added.)', '-8-', 'C', 'Policy Considerations', 'We disagree with defendant’s contention that § 34-4-26 discourages recording of instruments since it does not apply to unrecorded instruments. As noted above, the statute applies only to “recorded contract[s], deed[s] or other instrument[s] entered into which create[ ] a * * * right of first refusal to purchase real estate * * * which by [their] own terms, [do] not provide for a specific expiration date * * *.” Section 34-4-26(a) (emphasis added). If one who obtains a right of first refusal wishes to avoid the statute’s reach, he or she need only specify an expiration date for that right in the instrument through which it is created.', 'In the same vein, defendant points out that, if the Agreement had never been recorded, § 34-4-26 would not apply to the right at issue here, and that right would have therefore remained intact. The defendant characterizes such a result as “absurd.” In addressing this argument, we must resort to the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP), a now-defunct doctrine in Rhode Island. Although we do so with little relish, we must analyze the RAP’s application to the Agreement to explain why it is questionable whether the right of first refusal at issue here was ever valid to begin with.', 'The classic formulation of the RAP is as follows: “No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.” John Chipman Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities § 201 at 191 (4th ed. 1942). Although Rhode Island statutorily abandoned the RAP in 1999, the doctrine was in full force and effect when the Agreement was executed in 1969. See G.L. 1956 § 34-11-38, as enacted by P.L. 1999, ch. 403, § 1; 3 The Law of Future Interests § 1450 at 502 (3d Borron ed. 2004). Because the Agreement granted a right of first refusal not to Dunbar personally, but to Bowen’s Wharf', '-9- Company, and because a corporation normally exists in perpetuity, that right may have been void ab initio under the RAP. 6 See G.L. 1956 §§ 7-1.2-202(d); 7-1.2-302(b)(1); Ferrero Construction Co. v. Dennis Rourke Corp., 536 A.2d 1137, 1144 (Md. 1988) (right of first refusal of unlimited duration granted to a corporation was invalid in view of the RAP).', 'Having concluded that the trial justice did not err in deciding that § 34-4-26 applies to the right granted in the Agreement or in declining to characterize that statute as a notice statute, we hold that the defendant’s right of first refusal has expired by operation of § 34-4-26.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case. 6', 'We acknowledge that this Court never decided whether the RAP applied to rights of first refusal before Rhode Island abolished the doctrine. See Brough v. Foley, 572 A.2d 63, 67 (R.I. 1990) (describing Rhode Island law on this issue as “unsettled”). However, among courts in other jurisdictions that have considered this issue, a majority have concluded that it does. See Old Port Cove Holdings, Inc. v. Old Port Cove Condominium Association One, Inc., 986 So.2d 1279, 1285-86 (Fla. 2008) (reviewing split of authority). Because this issue is not essential to our holding, and because the RAP is now defunct in Rhode Island, we decline to expand our jurisprudence on this doctrine. We address the RAP’s application to the Agreement only to refute defendant’s claim that the trial justice’s ruling produced an absurd result.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Ronald R.

121,(P2/04-3014A) State : v. : Bradley E. Bellem.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Bradley E. Bellem, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction declaring him to be in violation of his probation and executing four years of his previously imposed suspended sentence. On appeal, the defendant argues that there was no reliable evidence for the hearing justice to find he violated the terms of his probation and that, therefore, the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding a violation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In 2005, defendant pled nolo contendere to two counts of felony domestic assault. For each count, defendant was sentenced to eight years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI),', '-1- consisting of one year to serve and seven years suspended, with probation. The sentences were to run concurrently. In 2009, defendant pled nolo contendere to one count of violating a no- contact order. For that offense, defendant was sentenced to five years at the ACI, with one year to serve and four years suspended, with probation. Finally, and pertinent to the issues raised in this appeal, defendant was arrested for violating a no-contact order on November 7, 2010. The next day, the state filed a probation violation report pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure 1 alleging that defendant had failed to comply with the terms of his probation by failing to keep the peace and be of good behavior.', 'On December 15, 2010, the Superior Court heard testimony from two witnesses—Jay Rainville, one of the responding officers from the Foster Police Department, and Colette Spicer, the complaining witness—about the events of November 7, 2010.', 'Ms. Spicer testified that she had been staying at the Highland Rod & Gun Club (gun club) in Foster on November 7, 2010, and had received multiple telephone calls from defendant that day. According to Spicer, there was an active no-contact order in place at that time, prohibiting defendant from contacting her. 2', 'She testified that defendant expressed a desire to 1', 'Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows:', '“The court shall not revoke probation or revoke a suspension of', 'sentence or impose a sentence previously deferred except after a', 'hearing at which the defendant shall be afforded the opportunity to', 'be present and apprised of the grounds on which such action is', 'proposed. The defendant may be admitted to bail pending such', 'hearing. Prior to the hearing the State shall furnish the defendant', 'and the court with a written statement specifying the grounds upon', 'which action is sought under this subdivision.” 2', 'Although Ms. Spicer did not refer to multiple no-contact orders, the state maintained at the hearing that two no-contact orders were active. The defendant notes in his written submission to this Court that the state did not present any record of the alleged no-contact orders, but rather requested that the hearing justice take judicial notice of two active no-contact orders, which she did with no objection from defendant. Although defendant asserts on appeal that the existence of a no-contact order is not the type of fact that is generally appropriate for judicial notice, he', '-2- come see her at the gun club, and that the gun club’s vice president contacted Foster police on her behalf. Spicer also indicated that she could not remember several other details about the events that transpired that day.', 'Officer Rainville testified that on November 7 he responded to a call reporting a disturbance at the gun club and that, when he arrived at the scene, he found defendant sitting in a grey Jeep parked near the gun club’s locked gate. According to Officer Rainville, defendant stepped out of the vehicle as he approached, and Officer Rainville observed that defendant was on the telephone.', 'Officer Rainville asked defendant with whom he was speaking on the telephone, and defendant reported that “he was speaking to his friend Colette.” The defendant ended the call upon Officer Rainville’s request. Officer Rainville testified that he had been notified by dispatch that there were possible no-contact orders in place between defendant and Spicer. Officer Rainville further testified that while another officer attempted to verify with Spicer that defendant had, in fact, telephoned her, defendant called Spicer again, in Officer Rainville’s presence, to request that she come unlock the gun club’s gate. Upon verifying that defendant was on the phone with Spicer, the officers took defendant into custody.', 'At the conclusion of the violation hearing, the hearing justice found that defendant had violated two active no-contact orders, and thus had failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior, in violation of the terms of his probation. 3 The hearing justice executed four years of acknowledges, quite correctly, that by failing to object at the time to the hearing justice taking judicial notice of the no-contact orders, he has waived this argument on appeal under the well- recognized “raise-or-waive” rule. See State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010) (“As this Court has made clear, the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial.” citing State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828 (R.I. 2008)). 3', 'The hearing justice made several specific findings on the record:', '“This [c]ourt is reasonably satisfied [the two] no-contact', 'orders are valid. The [c]ourt is also reasonably satisfied that', '[defendant], in fact, violated the terms of those no-contact orders', '-3- defendant’s previously imposed sentence, with the remaining thirty months of the 2005 sentence suspended. The defendant appeals the hearing justice’s violation determination and imposition of sentence. 4', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'At a probation-violation hearing, the duty of the hearing justice is to determine “whether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v. Shepard, 33 A.3d 158, 163 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. English, 21 A.3d 403, 406 (R.I. 2011)). “The ‘burden of proof at a probation-violation hearing is much lower than the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt’ in a criminal trial.” Id. (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 406-07). In making this determination, the hearing justice must assess the credibility of witnesses and weigh the evidence presented. Id. The hearing justice’s credibility', 'by not having one, but at least two phone calls directed to Ms.', 'Spicer, one of which was actually while the officer, Officer', 'Rainville, was standing before him; the first of which the officer', 'had to have [defendant] get off the phone so that he could have any', 'kind of communication with him outside of that gun club.', '“As [the state] indicated, no contact is no contact. It is', 'wholly irrelevant to this [c]ourt that Ms. Spicer consented to', 'having that contact. It’s also interesting to note that she did not', 'indicate that she wanted to have the contact, but, as [defendant]', 'points out, that the evidence is simply bereft of that fact altogether.', 'This [c]ourt is not going to infer that Ms. Spicer was seeking out', 'that communication. Again, it’s irrelevant because no contact is no', 'contact, and that no-contact order requires [defendant] to refrain', 'from contacting the victim, the individual who is protected by not', 'one, but two valid no-contact orders.', '“This [c]ourt is reasonably satisfied [defendant] did, in fact,', 'violate the no-contact orders and in doing so he failed to keep the', 'peace and be of good behavior which are terms of his previously-', 'imposed sentences from this Superior Court.” 4', 'Although defendant filed his notice of appeal prematurely, before the final entry of judgment, this Court will treat the appeal as timely.

Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 419 n.10 (R.I. 2011).', '-4- assessments are given “great deference,” English, 21 A.3d at 407, “[a]nd this Court will not ‘second-guess’ supportable credibility assessments of a hearing justice in a probation-revocation hearing.” State v. Jackson, 966 A.2d 1225, 1229 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Johnson, 899 A.2d 478, 482 (R.I. 2006)). Thus, upon review, this Court will consider only “whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.” Shepard, 33 A.3d at 163 (quoting English, 21 A.3d at 407).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that, given Ms. Spicer’s limited recollection of the night in question and the lack of testimony that defendant’s telephone calls were in any way harassing or upsetting, the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that defendant had breached the peace and failed to be of good behavior. In particular, defendant argues that the state adduced weak evidence concerning not only the existence of the no-contact order(s), but also defendant’s violation thereof, because Spicer could not remember many of the day’s details and did not testify that defendant’s contact was intimidating. In sum, defendant asserts that, when considered in toto, “there was a complete lack of reliable evidence of conduct on the part of [defendant] that reasonably constituted evidence of not keeping the peace or being of good behavior * * *.”', 'The state responds that the undisputed testimony taken at the hearing from Spicer and Officer Rainville demonstrates that defendant contacted Spicer in violation of the judicially noticed no-contact orders. Therefore, the state argues, the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation of the terms of defendant’s probation.', '-5-', 'Ms. Spicer testified to the existence of at least one active no-contact order, and the hearing justice took judicial notice of two active no-contact orders, with no objection from the defendant. Based on the uncontroverted testimony of two witnesses that the defendant directed multiple phone calls to Spicer on that day, the hearing justice found that the defendant violated the terms of those no-contact orders.', 'Having carefully reviewed the record, we are satisfied that, given the evidence presented, the hearing justice was well within her zone of discretion in concluding that the defendant failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior when he violated the no-contact orders by calling Spicer on November 7, 2010. 5', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. 5', 'Neither party cited to case law defining the range of conduct that amounts to violation of a no- contact order; but under Rhode Island law, it is fair to say that the requirement of no contact inuring in such an order is a strict one: “[t]he words ‘any contact’ in the [no-contact] order are as unequivocal as they are broad.” State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 925 (R.I. 2005). This Court has affirmed a hearing justice’s determination that defendant violated the terms of his probation when he had more than “coincidental” contact with a party protected under a no-contact order. Compare State v. English, 21 A.3d 403, 405-06, 408 (R.I. 2011) (holding that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a probation violation where the defendant stopped outside the victim’s house and engaged in a brief conversation with her contrary to the terms of a no-contact order, even though there was conflicting testimony as to who initiated the contact, as well as the contents of the exchange), with State v. Conti, 672 A.2d 885, 886-87 (R.I. 1996) (concluding that the defendant did not violate a no-contact order, and thus did not violate the terms of his probation, when he casually greeted the victim on three occasions in public areas, reasoning that the contact was merely coincidental).', '-6-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

122,Argelis Pichardo : v. : Julie Stevens et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, Argelis Pichardo, appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Julie Stevens.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted to this Court on behalf of the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Collision of October 19, 2007', 'A police report attached as an exhibit to the memorandum in support of Ms. Stevens’s motion for summary judgment (the Accident Report) sets forth details relative to an automobile', '-1- collision that gave rise to the underlying lawsuit; we proceed now to summarize those details in pertinent part. On October 19, 2007, a 1996 Toyota Camry registered to Ms. Stevens (the Camry) struck a car that was parked at 14 Warrington Street in Providence. The parked car was registered to Mr. Pichardo. One of Mr. Pichardo’s co-workers saw the incident and flagged down a police officer. The witness told the police officer that he followed the Camry to Early Street after it left the scene of the collision. The witness saw ―a black male wearing blue jeans and a dark sweatshirt exit the vehicle and possibly enter‖ a house at 152 Early Street. After speaking with the witness, the police officer knocked on the front door. No one answered. The police then had the Camry towed from the scene and ―a hold was * * * placed on the [Camry] for the registered owner,‖ Ms. Stevens. Neither party has contested the accuracy of the Accident Report.', 'B', 'The Litigation1', 'On January 6, 2010, Mr. Pichardo filed a complaint in Superior Court against Ms. Stevens seeking damages pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 31-33-6 and 31-33-7. The former of the two just-referenced statutes provides that a vehicle owner may be liable for the acts of another person who operates the owner’s car ―with the consent of the owner.‖ Section 31-33-6. The latter statute provides (1) that evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of a car involved in an accident or collision ―shall be prima facie evidence‖ of the defendant-owner’s consent and (2) that ―the absence of consent shall be an affirmative defense to be set up in the answer and proved by the defendant.‖ Section 31-33-7. Ms. Stevens raised such an affirmative defense in her answer to Mr. Pichardo’s complaint. 1', 'For the sake of narrative clarity, we have deliberately placed our description of the litigation of this case at an early point in this ―Facts and Travel‖ section.', '-2-', 'On December 16, 2010, Ms. Stevens filed a motion for summary judgment; in the memorandum that accompanied her motion, Ms. Stevens contended that ―the driver was operating the [Camry] without [her] consent‖ at the time of the collision.', 'Ms. Stevens’s memorandum stated that, after her insurance company notified her of the collision, she ―realized that her vehicle was no longer in the possession of the friend with whom she had left it.‖ Attached to her memorandum, Ms. Stevens submitted, inter alia, her affidavit (the Affidavit) and a copy of a stolen vehicle report that she filed with the police in Taunton, Massachusetts, on October 27, 2007 (the Stolen Vehicle Report). In her Affidavit, Ms. Stevens averred: (1) that on the day of the collision, she had boarded a flight for West Palm Beach, Florida, at 7:45 a.m.; (2) that the Camry, which she admittedly owned, ―was a stolen vehicle;‖ and (3) ―that the unidentified driver described in the [Accident Report] * * * did not have [her] consent to operate [the Camry].‖', 'The memorandum filed in support of Ms. Stevens’s motion for summary judgment argued that, ―[i]n light of [the Affidavit] and the [Stolen Vehicle Report], there can be no genuine dispute that the driver was operating the vehicle without the consent of Ms. Stevens at the time of the accident, thus relieving Ms. Stevens of any liability for the driver’s actions.‖ In addition to the Affidavit and the Stolen Vehicle Report, Ms. Stevens also submitted to the court a police record of her visit to the Taunton Police Department (the Incident Report), the previously referenced Accident Report, and an e-mail from Southwest Airlines confirming Ms. Stevens’s trip to Florida on October 19, 2007 at 7:45 a.m.', 'Mr. Pichardo filed an objection to Ms. Stevens’s motion for summary judgment, and he requested that the court continue the scheduled hearing on Ms. Stevens’s motion so that he could take Ms. Stevens’s deposition. Mr. Pichardo’s counsel then deposed Ms. Stevens on March 21, 2011. The motion justice ultimately granted Ms. Stevens’s motion for summary judgment at the', '-3- conclusion of an April 26, 2011 hearing; she ruled that ―the car was stolen, and * * * [Ms. Stevens] did not give permission for anyone to drive the vehicle.‖', 'C', 'The Deposition', 'As previously indicated, counsel for Mr. Pichardo took Ms. Stevens’s deposition on March 21, 2011. The following paragraphs summarize the relevant portions of Ms. Stevens’s testimony at that deposition.', 'Ms. Stevens testified that, at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, October 18, 2007 (the day before the collision), she drove the Camry in order to go fishing with her daughter in Taunton. Upon arriving in the vicinity of the pond that was their destination, she left the car in a parking lot. When they were done fishing, Ms. Stevens and her daughter returned to the parking lot, but they discovered that the Camry was missing. Ms. Stevens testified that she did not call the police because she thought that her husband (from whom she had recently separated) may have taken the Camry without telling her. However, Ms. Stevens also acknowledged during her deposition: (1) that her husband did not have a key to the Camry on the day when she said the car was taken; (2) that at no time in the past had he taken the car without her permission; and (3) that, although she had told her husband that she was taking their daughter fishing, she had not told him where they were going. Ms. Stevens further testified that there was only one key to the Camry and that she had that key in her possession while she was fishing.', 'Ms. Stevens further testified that, instead of calling the police, she phoned a friend to pick up her and her daughter at the parking lot. Ms. Stevens stated that, when she returned home that evening, she called her husband to ask whether he had taken the Camry. He told her that he did not have the car. Again, Ms. Stevens did not call the police to report her missing Camry.', '-4-', 'Ms. Stevens also testified that, on October 19 (the day after the fishing trip and the day of the collision), she took a 7:45 a.m. flight from Providence in order to visit relatives in Florida. Ms. Stevens stated that she returned from her trip to Florida three days later (i.e., October 22). Greeting her at the door was a note stating that the post office was holding a certified letter for her. She retrieved the letter ―days later;‖ it was from a garage in Providence that had her Camry. Ms. Stevens testified that, once she received the certified letter, she ―immediately‖ contacted the owner of the garage, who told her that her car had been towed following an accident. The garage owner also advised Ms. Stevens that ―there was a hold on [her Camry]‖ and that she needed to contact the police before she could pick it up. Ms. Stevens testified that this phone call was the first time she had heard of the collision. Although the Camry was damaged in the collision, Ms. Stevens testified that she did not remember anyone at the garage or anyone from her insurance company having mentioned that there was evidence of tampering with the ignition or damage to the steering column.', 'Eventually, on October 27, 2007, Ms. Stevens contacted the police in Taunton about her missing Camry.', 'D', 'The Police Report', 'As noted, on October 27, 2007, Ms. Stevens went to the Taunton Police Department to report her Camry as stolen. She made this initial contact with police nine days after the alleged theft took place and five days after she returned from her trip to Florida. In the Stolen Vehicle Report, Ms. Stevens filled out a section in which she indicated that the Camry had been stolen since 10 a.m. on October 18, 2007—the same day that Ms. Stevens testified that she took the Camry to go fishing at 4:30 p.m. Ms. Stevens signed this section of the Stolen Vehicle Report', '-5- under penalty of perjury. Conversely, the Incident Report prepared by the Taunton police—a summary of Ms. Stevens’s visit to the police station on October 27—notes that Ms. Stevens told the police that she ―JUST RETURNEED [sic] HOME FROM FLORIDA AND RECEIVED A CERTIFIED LETTER THAT THEY HAD HER CAR WHICH SHE LEFT AT A FRIENDS [sic] HOME WHEN SHE LEFT LAST FRIDAY 10/19.‖ (Block capital letters in original.)', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'On appeal, Mr. Pichardo contends that inconsistencies in the evidence create genuine issues of material fact as to whether or not Ms. Stevens gave the unidentified driver consent to use her Camry on October 19, 2007. For that reason, he argues that summary judgment was incorrectly granted in Ms. Stevens’s favor.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'We review the granting of a motion for summary judgment in a de novo manner.

It provides as follows:', '―In all civil proceedings, evidence that at the time of the', 'accident or collision the motor vehicle was registered in the name', 'of the defendant, shall be prima facie evidence that it was being', 'operated with the consent of the defendant, and the absence of', 'consent shall be an affirmative defense to be set up in the answer', 'and proved by the defendant.‖ Section 31-33-7 (emphasis added).', '-7- We have noted that the General Assembly, in enacting this statute, acknowledged that there is ―greater justice * * * [in] placing the burden of proof of consent upon the owner of a motor vehicle * * *.‖ Kent v. Draper Soap Co., 75 R.I. 30, 35, 63 A.2d 571, 574 (1949).', 'This Court has previously been crystal clear regarding the effect that the just-cited statute has in the summary judgment context.', 'In Kent, decided more than six decades ago, we announced that ―rarely under [§ 31-33-7] can it be ruled as a matter of law that an affirmative defense has been made out or that a prima facie case under the statute has been overcome.‖ Kent, 75 R.I. at 37, 63 A.2d at 575. We further stated that, in cases where § 31-33-7 is in issue, evidence of vehicle registration ―cannot be treated as a mere presumption;‖ instead, this ―prima facie evidence remains in the case throughout the trial and is entitled to be weighed like any other evidence upon the question of fact as to consent.‖ Kent, 75 R.I. 36–37, 63 A.2d at 575. Accordingly, sworn statements that a driver involved in a collision ―did not have permission to use [the defendant-owner’s] automobile * * * are relevant to [the defendant-owner’s] attempt to establish [an] affirmative defense under § 31-33-7, but they are not sufficient to prove that defense at the summary judgment stage.‖ Andreoni v. Ainsworth, 898 A.2d 1240, 1244 (R.I. 2006) (emphasis added).', 'We have recognized that only a ―rare and exceptional case‖ would take the issue of consent out of the hands of a jury and ―prove as a matter of law the [affirmative] defense‖ under § 31-33-7.2 See Hill v. Cabral, 62 R.I. 11, 19, 2 A.2d 482, 485 (1938). There is, however, 2', 'This Court has referenced an example of a ―rare and exceptional case‖ when, in dictum, it stated that ―[a] situation in which a car rental agency expressly limits who is allowed to drive its vehicle * * * may be the rare and exceptional case that proves the affirmative defense of lack of consent as a matter of law.‖ Andreoni v. Ainsworth, 898 A.2d 1240, 1243 n.7 (R.I. 2006) (discussing LaFratta v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 751 A.2d 1281 (R.I. 2000)).

See id. In moving for summary judgment, she pointed to two pieces of evidence—her Affidavit and the Stolen Vehicle Report— to support her position that the unidentified driver did not have her consent to drive the Camry on the day of the collision.', 'As an initial matter, the Affidavit is insufficient for Ms. Stevens to prevail on summary judgment. We addressed this very issue in Andreoni, 898 A.2d at 1241; in that case, a vehicle owner was named as a defendant in a lawsuit after her car was involved in a collision. She provided ―deposition testimony and a sworn affidavit‖ in support of her argument that the person driving her car at the time of the accident did not have her consent. Id. The motion justice granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant-owner based on the absence of consent. Id. On appeal, this Court reversed the grant of summary judgment, holding that when a motion justice is presented with (1) prima facie evidence of consent pursuant to the express terms of § 31-33-7 and (2) sworn statements maintaining that the owner did not give consent to the driver involved in the accident, such conflicting evidence as to the issue of consent creates an issue of fact for a jury to decide. Andreoni, 898 A.2d at 1244; see also Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, Inc., 93 R.I. 4, 13, 170 A.2d 604, 608 (1961) (recognizing that this Court has ―held * * * that evidence that [a] vehicle was registered in [a] defendant’s name was enough to take the question of consent to the jury‖).', 'Ms. Stevens’s Affidavit does not resolve the issue of consent in this case. It is undisputed that Ms. Stevens was the registered owner of the Camry at the time of the collision; as expressly provided for in § 31-33-7, that fact alone serves as prima facie evidence that she gave consent to the unidentified driver. Her Affidavit, however, fails to overcome the prima facie evidence language of the contract would limit the rental agency’s consent to drivers named in the agreement. See id.', '-9- created by statute. Looking at the competing evidence together, there is unquestionably an unresolved material issue of fact in this case. To allow the motion justice to grant summary judgment based on the Affidavit alone would ignore the General Assembly’s decision to make ownership ―prima facie evidence‖ of consent. See § 31-33-7; see also Kent, 75 R.I. at 37, 63 A.2d at 575 (noting that rarely under § 31-33-7 can the affirmative defense be proven as a matter of law—―especially * * * when the proof rests upon oral testimony introduced by the party upon whom the burden rests and upon inferences from the surrounding circumstances‖).', 'Ms. Stevens sought to bolster her argument by referencing the Stolen Vehicle Report. That document, however, does not transform this matter into a ―rare and exceptional case‖ that would entitle Ms. Stevens to summary judgment. See Hill, 62 R.I. at 19, 2 A.2d at 485. Rather, when viewed in the context of the remaining evidence presented to the motion justice (including the prima facie evidence), the Stolen Vehicle Report only highlights the need for a fact-finder to weigh the evidence and make credibility determinations. For instance, the Stolen Vehicle Report indicates that the Camry was stolen on Thursday, October 18, 2007 ―off of Bay [Street],‖ where Ms. Stevens testified that she had gone fishing with her daughter. The Incident Report, however, states that Ms. Stevens ―LEFT [the Camry] AT A FRIENDS [sic] HOME WHEN SHE LEFT [for Florida] LAST FRIDAY 10/19‖—a position that Ms. Stevens reiterated in arguing for summary judgment. Next, Ms. Stevens wrote in the Stolen Vehicle Report that the Camry had been missing since 10 a.m. on October 18. This is inconsistent with her deposition, in which she testified that she took the Camry to go fishing with her daughter at 4:30 p.m. on that same day.', 'Ms. Stevens argues that, as a matter of law, the unidentified driver did not have her consent to drive her Camry on the day of the collision. Yet, as the above-summarized evidence so amply demonstrates, the record is replete with unanswered questions with respect to the', '- 10 - consent issue. We do not mention those inconsistencies for the purpose of accusing Ms. Stevens of mendacity. The point is that, at the summary judgment stage, such determinations should not be made in the face of competing evidence. See Estate of Giuliano, 949 A.2d at 394. In our opinion, the motion justice erred in choosing to believe two pieces of evidence (the Affidavit and portions of the Stolen Vehicle Report) while overlooking the statute-based prima facie evidence and relevant factual discrepancies. See Kent, 75 R.I. at 37, 63 A.2d at 575 (―Except in some rare and unusual circumstances, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence are in the first instance for the consideration of the trier of the facts.‖).', 'Summary judgment is a ―drastic step‖ that should ―only [be granted] if the case is legally dead on arrival.‖ See Mitchell v.

123,Hector Jaiman : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The applicant, Hector Jaiman, appeals to this Court from the Superior Court’s denial of his application for postconviction relief. Jaiman previously was convicted of first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder, and assault with a dangerous weapon. Before this Court, Jaiman contends that his application for postconviction relief should have been granted based on a violation of his right to due process. He also argues that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel because his counsel failed to object to what the applicant maintains was improper witness vouching and because his trial counsel failed to object to a first-degree murder instruction that the trial justice imparted to the jury. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court denying the application for postconviction relief.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The factual background of this case is described at length in the direct appeal of defendant’s conviction—viz., State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 985-87 (R.I. 2004). For the sake of brevity, we shall summarize only the facts that are relevant to the issues raised by this appeal.', 'A', 'Background', 'On the evening of September 18, 1993, Jaiman was operating a motor vehicle in Central Falls accompanied by Ariel Muriel. As they traveled, the pair encountered a car driven by Albert Robertson, in which Thomas DeGrafft and Dean Zigbuo were passengers. As the two cars drove side-by-side, Muriel fired a handgun into Robertson’s car. Robertson was struck, DeGrafft was mortally wounded, and Zigbuo escaped without injury.', 'On May 12, 1994, Jaiman and Muriel were charged with six criminal charges, including: murder of DeGrafft, assault with intent to murder Robertson, conspiracy to murder DeGrafft, conspiracy to assault Robertson, assault with a dangerous weapon upon Zigbuo, and conspiracy to commit felony assault upon Zigbuo. While he was incarcerated awaiting trial, Muriel entered into a plea bargain with the Attorney General. Muriel agreed that, in exchange for his testimony against Jaiman, he would plead guilty to a reduced charge of the second-degree murder of DeGrafft. After his plea was accepted by a justice of the Superior Court, Muriel received a sentence of fifty years for second-degree murder, with twenty years to serve and thirty years suspended, and a guarantee that he would appear before the Parole Board in July 2000. In accordance with the plea bargain, Muriel, through an interpreter, gave an unsworn seven-page statement to the Central Falls Police, in which he said that Jaiman had provided him with a gun and had instructed him to shoot Robertson.', '-2-', 'B', 'The Trial', 'In October and November of 1995, Jaiman went to trial before a jury; Muriel testified at the trial as the prosecutor’s key witness. However, the jury was unable to achieve unanimity, and a mistrial was declared. In February 2000, Jaiman went to trial a second time. During that trial, the state again called Muriel to the stand, but this time, he refused to testify, maintaining that it was his understanding that his plea agreement required him to testify truthfully only once. When he was asked whether he had testified truthfully at the first trial, he responded, “[a]s far as I remember, I think so.” Nonetheless, Muriel professed that he had no memory of Jaiman saying anything to him about Robertson, he had no memory of Jaiman giving him a gun that night, he had no memory of Jaiman telling him to shoot Robertson, and he had no memory of what he did with the gun afterward. He continued to maintain that position even after he was shown the statement he had provided to the Central Falls Police and after the state attempted to refresh his recollection by showing him a transcript of his testimony from Jaiman’s first trial. He explained that his memory failure was the result of the passage of time and the stress arising from his incarceration.', 'As a result of Muriel’s memory failure, the trial justice permitted portions of the witness’s police statement to be read to the jury. Significantly, when Muriel testified that he could not remember the position of the vehicles when he started firing at the Robertson car, he was presented with his police statement in an attempt to refresh his recollection. The following portion of that statement was read to Muriel in the presence of the jury:', '“Q', 'Did there come a time that any of the cars turned off the', 'street? * * *', '“A', 'Answer: The shooting stopped and they turned left and we', 'turned left and they turned right, I think. Question: Before', '-3-', 'you turned left did you shoot at the car any other time?', 'Answer: Yes, as [Jaiman]’s car was turning onto the street I', 'shot twice more. Question: Where did you go then?”', 'The state then moved to have the entire police statement entered into evidence as a full exhibit, and defendant objected. However, after a recess, defense counsel said that he had reached an agreement with the state and that he did not object to the introduction of the three questions that the prosecution had identified. The trial justice also allowed the introduction of additional portions of the police statement as a full exhibit as a prior inconsistent statement.', 'On March 3, 2000, the jury found Jaiman guilty of the first-degree murder of DeGrafft, as well as assault with intent to murder Robertson and assault with a dangerous weapon upon Zigbuo. 1 Jaiman filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied, and on March 9, 2000, he sentenced Jaiman to a mandatory term of life imprisonment for the first-degree murder and to two concurrent terms of twenty years to serve on both assault convictions.', 'C', 'The Direct Appeal', 'Jaiman timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court. 2 It is fair to say that defendant’s appeal to this Court focused on the introduction of Muriel’s police statement during the trial. In a decision dated June 22, 2004, this Court held that the police statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, and we affirmed the conviction. 3 Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 990. 1', 'The count for conspiracy to murder DeGrafft did not go to the jury because the trial justice granted a judgment of acquittal after the state’s case. Similarly, the counts of conspiracy to assault Robertson and conspiracy to commit felony assault upon Zigbuo did not go to the jury because the state dismissed the counts. 2', 'In June 2002, the case was remanded to the Superior Court for a hearing on Jaiman’s motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. On September 26, 2002, the trial justice denied the motion for a new trial, and the matter was returned to this Court for oral argument. 3', 'For the first time on appeal, Jaiman also argued that Muriel’s statement did not qualify as a recorded recollection under Rule 803(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, nor was it admissible as a statement against interest under Rule 804(b)(3) of the Rhode Island Rules of', '-4-', 'D', 'Postconviction Relief', 'On December 16, 2004, Jaiman filed a pro se application for postconviction relief in the Superior Court, which was amended twice after counsel was appointed to represent him. In Jaiman’s second amended application, he delineated twelve reasons to support his argument that his conviction and his sentence violated the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of Rhode Island, including that his trial attorney was ineffective because he did not object to the prosecutor’s unnecessary multiple references to “truthfulness” when addressing Muriel’s cooperation agreement, that his trial attorney was ineffective because he failed to request any type of cautionary instruction when the prosecutor improperly vouched for Muriel’s truthfulness, and that his sentence “exceeded the maximum authorized by law and is otherwise not in accordance with the sentence authorized by law.” 4', 'A hearing on Jaiman’s postconviction-relief application was held on August 13, 2008. During the hearing, the parties agreed to address the specific issue of whether there was merit to Jaiman’s allegation that he was currently serving an illegal sentence. 5 After the parties presented their respective arguments, the trial justice concluded that counsel’s argument that Jaiman was Evidence. State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 987 (R.I. 2004). He also argued that Muriel’s extensive memory lapses rendered him functionally unavailable for cross-examination and, therefore, that the use and introduction into evidence of the police statement violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 987-88. We held that those arguments had been waived because defendant failed to raise them below. 4', 'Jaiman alleged nine other grounds for postconviction relief in his application. Those claims, however, are not before this Court. 5', 'Jaiman phrases this argument as an “illegal sentence.” This Court has defined an illegal sentence as a sentence “that is not authorized by the statute establishing the punishment that may be imposed for the particular crime or crimes.” State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 143 (R.I. 2008). Essentially, however, Jaiman has challenged the legality of his conviction by arguing that, as an aider and abettor, he cannot be convicted of a more serious offense than the principal. For consistency with the record, this Court will continue to refer to this argument as an “illegal sentence,” despite the inartful phrasing of the claim.', '-5- serving an illegal sentence was “not supported either in law or in fact or frankly in policy as to the rights to plea bargain and the right of the state to seek and prosecute at levels that they choose for the defendants that are targeted for violation of the law.”', 'Upon review of the other issues argued in defendant’s brief, the trial justice concluded that he saw “no reason to convene any kind of evidentiary hearing at all claiming basically to the ineffective assistance because [trial counsel] represented the defendant and somehow sat on his hands and failed to object at certain times or permit inculpable faulty statements to come in,” and “[f]rankly, the Rhode Island Supreme Court ruled on a fair amount of that already and even before closing argument that there was a decision in Jaiman reported at 850 A.2d 984.” The trial justice further explained that he saw', '“nothing raised in [trial counsel’s] brief * * * or delineated in [trial', 'counsel’s] memoranda * * * that any stretch of the imagination', 'transgresses or reaches the Strickland level and I’m of the mind', 'that to the extend [sic] that you care to have this matter reviewed', 'by the Supreme Court, by all means take it upstairs if you like, but', 'I see no reason to offer judgment in favor of your client in this', 'matter.”', 'Before he dismissed Jaiman’s postconviction-relief application, the trial justice asked Jaiman’s postconviction-relief counsel to explain what would be gained by inviting trial counsel to the stand to explain his reasons for objecting or not objecting to certain evidence. Jaiman’s counsel responded that he believed there was merit to the allegation that the objections should have been made by trial counsel. He also argued that even if he personally did not believe there was merit to the issues in the postconviction-relief application, and if he had reported such an opinion in a Shatney memorandum, Jaiman nonetheless “has the opportunity to proceed even pro se if he still wanted to have those issues brought before the Court.” See Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000).', '-6-', 'The trial justice responded that Shatney does not require the court to provide a hearing in every single instance for which there is a prayer for relief and, in this case, that he concluded all the issues were “ripe for determination without evidentiary hearing.” Jaiman’s counsel asked the trial justice to “note our exception,” and requested permission to allow Jaiman to address the court. After listening to Jaiman’s comments, the trial justice said that he was not persuaded, and he denied the application for postconviction relief. A formal judgment was entered, denying Jaiman’s application. Jaiman timely appealed to this Court. Before this Court, Jaiman raises the following four issues on appeal of the denial of his postconviction-relief application: (1) his due process rights were violated when the prosecutor improperly vouched for Muriel’s credibility, (2) his conviction for first-degree murder violated G.L. 1956 § 11-1-3, 6 (3) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the first-degree murder instruction, and (4) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s improper witness vouching.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'General Laws 1956 § 10-9.1-1 creates a postconviction remedy “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interests of justice.” Higham v. State, 45 A.3d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 2012) (quoting DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011)).

When “reviewing the denial of postconviction relief, this Court affords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact and will not disturb his or her ruling ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Higham, 45 A.3d at 1183 (quoting Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 907-08 (R.I. 2011)).', 'When evaluating allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the standard employed by this Court is identical to that set forth by the Supreme Court of the United States in Strickland v.

(citing State v. Goncalves, 941 A.2d 842, 847 (R.I. 2008)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Vouching as Due-Process Violation', 'Jaiman asserts that his due-process right to be tried only on evidence properly admitted before the jury was violated because, he argues, the state wrongly vouched for Muriel’s credibility. The state responds that Muriel’s credibility was an issue addressed on direct and cross-examination, and the prosecutor’s statement during closing argument merely rebutted the defense counsel’s statements.', 'Section 10-9.1-8, entitled “[w]aiver of or failure to assert claims,” provides in pertinent part:', '“Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly,', 'voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted', 'in the conviction or sentence or in any other proceeding the', 'applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a', 'subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the interest of', '-9-', 'justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground', 'for relief.” This Court has held that § 10-9.1-8 “codifies the doctrine of res judicata as applied to petitions for post-conviction relief.” State v. DeCiantis, 813 A.2d 986, 993 (R.I. 2003). Res judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties or those in privity with them. See Carillo v. Moran, 463 A.2d 178, 182 (R.I. 1983); see also Ouimette v. State, 785 A.2d 1132, 1138 (R.I. 2001) (enumerating the elements of res judicata as: “(1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the issues; (3) identity of the claims for relief; and (4) finality of the judgment”).', 'In this case, Jaiman could have, but did not, raise his due-process claim in the direct appeal of his conviction, which focused solely on the admissibility of Muriel’s out-of-court statements.', 'Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 987.', 'We hold, therefore, that Jaiman’s postconviction challenge is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Accordingly, we will not consider it.', 'B', 'Illegal Sentence', 'Jaiman also maintains that § 11-1-3 should be interpreted to require that an aider and abettor cannot be convicted of and punished for a more serious offense than the principal, and in this case, because the shooter, Muriel, was convicted of second-degree murder, Jaiman’s conviction for the more serious offense of first-degree murder was improper. Jaiman relies on what he argues is the plain and ordinary meaning of § 11-1-3, as well as the rule of lenity, to support his interpretation. The state, however, argues that res judicata bars Jaiman’s substantive claim under § 11-1-3. If further contends that even if the claim is not precluded, the plain and unambiguous language of § 11-1-3 does not limit the potential that an aider and abettor will be convicted of an offense that is the same as or less than that of the principal. The state also argues', '- 10 - that the rule of lenity should not apply because § 11-1-3 is unambiguous and not susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.', 'Before addressing the merits of defendant’s argument, we first will consider whether the issue is properly before this Court on appeal. Section 10-9.1-8 provides a procedural bar to “the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, even if the particular issue was not raised.” Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1284 n.7 (quoting Ouimette, 785 A.2d at 1138). In our opinion, Jaiman’s argument that he suffered the imposition of an illegal sentence should have been raised on direct appeal. However, our reading of the record reveals that Jaiman’s attorney and the state agreed to address this issue at the postconviction-relief hearing and that the trial justice considered the arguments of each party and rendered a decision. Accordingly, because the issue was raised before the trial justice and ruled upon by him, this Court will not deem the argument waived and will address it. Cf. State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”).', '“This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation in a de novo manner.” State v. Graff, 17 A.3d 1005, 1010 (R.I. 2011). In our approach to this interpretive task, we are mindful that “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent.” Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003). We have stated, however, that “[t]he plain statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent.” State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005). And, we have indicated that “a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed.” Martone, 824 A.2d at 431. Accordingly, “[w]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we must enforce the statute as written by giving the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning.” Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010 (quoting Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of', '- 11 - New England, Inc. v. Gelati, 865 A.2d 1028, 1037 (R.I. 2004)). “It is only when confronted with an unclear or ambiguous statutory provision that this Court will examine the statute in its entirety to discern the legislative intent and purpose behind the provision.” In re Harrison, 992 A.2d 990, 994 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. LaRoche, 925 A.2d 885, 888 (R.I. 2007)).', 'We have not had the opportunity to squarely address the issue raised by defendant, i.e., whether an aider and abettor can be convicted of a more serious offense or suffer a greater penalty than the principal. In construing the language of § 11-1-3, however, it is our opinion that the plain and unambiguous language requires the interpretation that the question shall be answered in the affirmative.', 'Section 11-1-3 provides that “[e]very person who shall aid, assist, abet, counsel, hire, command, or procure another to commit any crime or offense, shall be proceeded against as principal or as an accessory before the fact.” (Emphasis added.) The plain language of this portion of § 11-1-3 explicitly provides that where, as here, defendant aided and abetted in the crime and was present when it was committed, it is not improper to convict and punish him as a principal. Indeed, in the past, we have recognized that “one need not have actually ‘pulled the trigger’ in order to have committed first degree murder.” State v. Diaz, 654 A.2d 1195, 1201 (R.I. 1995). Whether a defendant is charged as a principal or as an aider or abettor, “all who participate in a crime are severally responsible as principals, as though each had committed the offense alone.” Id. at 1202 (quoting State v. Medeiros, 535 A.2d 766, 772 (R.I. 1987)).', 'In this case, the evidence demonstrated to a jury’s satisfaction that Jaiman assisted Muriel in the murder and that Jaiman was present at the scene. Accordingly, Jaiman properly was convicted of murder. As we recognized previously, a “defendant’s manner of participation, whether as a principal or [as] an aider or abettor, is not an element of the crime.” State v. Davis,', '- 12 - 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005) (emphasis added). The prosecution is not required to “persuade a unanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt” with respect to the manner in which a defendant participated in a crime. 7 Id. This is significant because, in Rhode Island, there is no distinction between one who pulls the trigger and those associated with him or her; all parties involved in the crime are equally guilty of the completed offense. See 21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal Law § 163 at 275 (2008). Thus, the plain and unambiguous language of § 11-1-3 makes clear that the statute merely provides an alternative theory under which liability for the underlying substantive crime may be proven.', 'Section 11-1-3 also provides that “upon conviction[, the aider and abettor] shall suffer the like punishment as the principal offender.” Here, both Muriel and Jaiman were subject to punishment for murder.', 'The indictments charging Jaiman and Muriel did not include the specific degree of murder for which they were charged, and both could have been convicted of either first-degree murder or second-degree murder. Although Muriel pled to the lesser included offense of second-degree murder, this does not negate the fact that he was subject to a first- degree murder charge. It was only because of Muriel’s intervening plea bargain that Jaiman and Muriel were not similarly situated. Nothing in the statute or in the prior holdings of this Court tethers one defendant’s conviction and sentence to the criminal liability of another who participated in the same crime. Consequently, it is our firm opinion that Jaiman was properly charged and convicted of first-degree murder.', 'Our holding is consistent with the manner in which other jurisdictions have interpreted similar accomplice liability statutes. For example, the United States Supreme Court, which 7', 'Our holding in Davis was based on the pertinent statutory language of § 11-1-3, which “eliminates the legal distinction between [1] the commission of a crime as a principal and [2] aiding and abetting another in the commission of a crime.” State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005).', '- 13 - interpreted a similar federal statute, decided that an aider and abettor could be convicted even when the principal has been acquitted. See Standefer v. United States, 447 U.S. 10, 11, 19 (1980). In that case, after a revenue official was acquitted of accepting unlawful payments, Standefer moved to dismiss the charges against him, arguing, on principles of collateral estoppel, that because the principal was acquitted, he could not be convicted of aiding and abetting that principal. Id. at 11-13. In rejecting that argument, the Supreme Court traced the origins of aiding and abetting and found that there was “a clear intent to permit the conviction of accessories to federal criminal offenses despite the prior acquittal of the actual perpetrator of the offense.” Id. at 19. Further, with the enactment of 18 U.S.C. § 2, 8 which was the statute at issue, all participants in conduct violating a federal criminal statute were considered “principals” and were punishable for their criminal conduct; the fate of other participants was irrelevant. Finally, the Court noted that collateral estoppel would not bar the accomplice’s trial because through lenity, compromise, or mistake, the jury might have reached an irrational result in the prior trial, which was not subject to review at the government’s instigation. Standefer, 447 U.S. at 21-23.', 'In addition, many commentators have concluded that there is no conceptual obstacle to convicting a secondary party of a more serious offense than is proved against the primary party. See Joshua Dressler, Understanding Criminal Law § 30.06[C] at 450 (2d ed. 1997). This concept relates to homicide as follows:', '“An accomplice may be convicted of first-degree murder, even', 'though the primary party is convicted of second-degree murder or 8', 'The full text of 18 U.S.C. § 2, entitled “[p]rincipals,” provides:', '“ (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or', 'aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its', 'commission, is punishable as a principal.', '“ (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly', 'performed by him or another would be an offense against the', 'United States, is punishable as a principal.”', '- 14 -', 'of voluntary manslaughter. This outcome follows, for example, if', 'the secondary party, premeditatedly, soberly and calmly, assists in', 'a homicide, while the primary party kills unpremeditatedly,', 'drunkenly, or in provocation. Likewise, it is possible for a primary', 'party negligently to kill another (and, thus, be guilty of involuntary', 'manslaughter), while the secondary party is guilty of murder,', 'because he encouraged the primary actor’s negligent conduct, with', 'the intent that it result in the victim’s death.” Id.', 'Accordingly, the plain language of § 11-1-3, supported by our previous interpretation of aider and abettor liability and the history discussed in Standefer, rebuts Jaiman’s contention that the statute was not intended to authorize the conviction of an aider and abettor of a greater offense than the principal. Although “symmetry of results may be intellectually satisfying, it is not required.” Standefer, 447 U.S. at 25; see Farnsworth v. Zerbst, 98 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir. 1938) (“One may die, may escape, or obtain a pardon; but the other remains guilty.”). An aider and abettor’s conviction or sentence should not be reformed because the principal was acquitted or convicted of a different offense or degree of offense. To hold otherwise would capriciously condition a party’s conviction and sentence on the jury’s decision in another criminal case. Therefore, this Court finds that Jaiman’s conviction was proper based on the plain and ordinary meaning of § 11-1-3. 9', 'C', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', '1', 'Severity of Punishment', 'Jaiman argues that his trial counsel’s failure to object to the first-degree murder instruction constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. The state, however, argues that although 9', 'We acknowledge Jaiman’s argument concerning the rule of lenity; however, the rule of lenity does not apply to this case because there is only one reasonable interpretation of § 11-1-3. The rule of lenity is merely a principal of statutory construction; it is inapplicable when the legislative intent is clear. Guerro v. Fitzpatrick, 436 F.2d 378, 380 (1st Cir. 1971) (citing Milanovich v. United States, 365 U.S. 551, 554 (1961)).', '- 15 - Jaiman raised a substantive challenge to the interpretation of § 11-1-3 in his application for postconviction relief, he did not bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and it is therefore waived.', 'The state alternatively contends that even if Jaiman did not waive this contention, Jaiman’s allegation that an aider and abettor cannot be convicted of a greater offense than the principal is a novel theory in Rhode Island, upon which a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel may not be founded.', 'Our holding that an aider and abettor may, indeed, be convicted of a more serious offense than the principal, however, makes any further discussion of this issue unnecessary. In other words, the conviction was proper, and trial counsel’s failure to object cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel cannot be faulted for failing to raise a meritless objection.', '2', 'Failure to Object to Improper Vouching or to Request Cautionary Instructions', 'Finally, Jaiman contends that his trial counsel’s failure to object to what he argues was improper vouching for Muriel’s truthfulness during the state’s closing argument and failure to request a cautionary jury instruction regarding that comment constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. During his closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor said, “[b]ut the reality is that [Muriel] wasn’t going to get the deal that he wanted to make with the State of Rhode Island unless the State of Rhode Island was convinced he was telling the truth.”', 'The state argues that, while the prosecutor referred to the plea bargain, in no way did the state insinuate that it had special knowledge about Muriel’s truthfulness; the prosecutor merely rebutted defendant’s impeachment of Muriel’s credibility. The state also argues that, even if the statement was improper, not objecting to it may have been a tactical decision by counsel to prevent any further attention being drawn to Muriel’s credibility. Finally, the state maintains that', '- 16 - the trial justice gave appropriate, general instructions about the arguments and statements by both trial counsel to prevent the jurors from placing undue emphasis on any personal opinions expressed by counsel during closing argument.', 'We have held that “[a] prosecutor is ‘allowed considerable latitude in [closing] argument[s] * * * as long as [he or she] stays within the evidence and * * * legitimate inferences * * *.’” State v. Werner, 851 A.2d 1093, 1107 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Harding, 740 A.2d 1270, 1274 (R.I. 1999)). However, we also have said that “[i]t is improper for the prosecution to vouch for the credibility of a government witness.” State v. Chakouian, 537 A.2d 409, 412 (R.I. 1988) (quoting United States v. Roberts, 618 F.2d 530, 533 (9th Cir. 1980)). In Chakouian, this Court explained that “[o]ne means through which improper vouching may occur is by admission of plea agreements phrased in a manner that suggests that the government has special knowledge that its witness is speaking the truth.” Id. Improper vouching can also occur “if the prosecution ‘place[s] the prestige of the government behind the witness * * *.’” Id. (quoting Roberts, 618 F.2d at 533)).', 'It is not enough, however, for a defendant on appeal to assert that the prosecutor assured the jury that a witness’s testimony was credible. The defendant must be able to identify, as the basis for that comment, an explicit or implicit reference to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney or information not contained in the record. See Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 359-60 n.15 (1958). More specifically, with regard to cooperation agreements, this Court has expressly said that “the mere statement in the cooperation agreement that [an individual] would testify truthfully coupled with [his or] her acknowledgement that [he or] she could be charged with perjury if [he or] she failed to do so does not constitute impermissible vouching and certainly does not require reversal.” State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 34 (R.I.', '- 17 - 2009); see United States v. Dockray, 943 F.2d 152, 156 (1st Cir. 1991) (“It is not error to inform a jury of the contents of a plea agreement, nor is it improper for the government to call attention to a witness’[s] motivation for testifying.”).', 'In this case, Muriel was a recalcitrant witness who claimed that he remembered little or nothing about the crime at issue or his earlier statements about what had occurred. As a result, both sides liberally attacked his credibility. During his closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Muriel’s promise to speak truthfully. The specific statement that Jaiman challenges is the prosecutor’s remark that Muriel “wasn’t going to get the deal that he wanted to make with the State of Rhode Island unless the State of Rhode Island was convinced he was telling the truth.” Trial counsel did not object to that comment. Arguably, that comment could be construed as improper vouching and implying special knowledge on the part of the state as to Muriel’s truthfulness. See Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516, 528 (R.I. 2009). Compare Lawn, 355 U.S. at 359-60 n.15 (holding that prosecutor’s statement, “[w]e vouch for [Roth and Lubben] because we think they are telling the truth,” was not improper because he “did not say nor insinuate that the statement was based on personal knowledge or on anything other than the testimony of those witnesses given before the jury”), and Dockray, 943 F.2d at 156 (“It is not error to inform a jury of the contents of a plea agreement, nor is it improper for the government to call attention to a witness’[s] motivation for testifying.”), with Gradsky v. United States, 373 F.2d 706, 709-10 (5th Cir. 1967) (holding that it was improper for prosecutor to state “when we offer a witness we have to vouch for his credibility * * * the government representatives don’t put a witness on the stand unless there appears to be some credibility * * * [c]ertainly, the government has every opportunity to check out and to judge the credibility and truthfulness”) (emphasis omitted).', '- 18 -', 'Assuming without deciding that the prosecutor’s statement was objectionable, and further assuming that an objection raised to it would have precipitated a cautionary instruction from the trial justice, it is nonetheless our opinion that trial counsel’s failure to object to that single statement, in a record of several hundred pages, was not constitutionally deficient or that it could have so prejudiced Jaiman that it rendered the verdict in his trial unreliable. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687 (setting forth the two-prong test of whether counsel’s actions were objectively unreasonable and that prejudice results to establish ineffective assistance of counsel); Simpson v. State, 769 A.2d 1257, 1266 (R.I. 2001) (discussing Strickland). First, trial counsel’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s statements about Muriel’s credibility cannot be said to have been objectively unreasonable. Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential. In Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, the Court cautioned a defendant against “second-guess[ing] counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.” Further, “it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel’s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.”', 'Id. A fair assessment of counsel’s performance, therefore, “requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time.” Id.', 'Recognizing the difficulties inherent in making such an evaluation, “a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered sound trial strategy.’” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689 (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101 (1955)). In any given case, “[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance * * *[;] [e]ven the best criminal defense', '- 19 - attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.”', 'Id.; cf. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 133-34 (1982) (holding that the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants only a fair trial and a competent attorney; it does not ensure that the defense will recognize and raise every possible claim). In light of the high degree of deference that the courts should employ when evaluating counsel’s performance, Jaiman has not established that trial counsel’s failure to object or his failure to request a cautionary instruction was objectively unreasonable. See Washington v. State, 989 A.2d 94, 99 (R.I. 2010); see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.', 'Moreover, even if Jaiman had somehow satisfied the first prong of Strickland, we are convinced that he has not demonstrated the existence of any prejudice suffered as a result of the prosecutor’s statement concerning Muriel’s credibility. As previously discussed, in addition to failing to show that trial counsel’s performance was deficient, this Court also must find that trial counsel’s performance was so serious as to deprive defendant of a fair trial and therefore prejudiced the defense. See Strickland 466 U.S. at 687.', 'In this case, we are not satisfied that the prosecutor’s one reference in his closing argument was incurably prejudicial or that it demanded a declaration of mistrial. This one snippet is not so egregious that it should have caused a mistrial. Moreover, the trial justice cautioned the jurors that statements of counsel during the trial or in final argument are not evidence and are not to be considered by the jurors as evidence during their deliberations. See State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 930 (R.I. 2009) (holding that comments were not prejudicial when the trial justice instructed the jury that it alone was to judge credibility and that statements by attorneys during closing arguments were not evidence). Specifically, the trial justice instructed, “statements of lawyer[s], either to you in their opening statement or in their closing argument or whatever way they frame the question, those statements and arguments are not evidence.” In', '- 20 - addition, immediately before closing arguments, the trial justice explained that “what a lawyer say[s] is not evidence.” See State v. Fortes, 922 A.2d 143, 151 (R.I. 2007) (“in light of the clear instructions given by the trial justice,” the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument “was not unfairly prejudicial”). Accordingly, we hold that trial counsel’s failure to object did not prejudice Jaiman or undermine the validity of the trial and the verdict reached.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Suffice it to say, it resulted from a drug deal gone wrong. With that in mind, we turn to the relevant facts adduced at trial. Early in the morning of March 1, 2009, Matthew DePetrillo and Robert Murray refused to pay Francis 2 Meseck for some marijuana, resulting in multiple angry phone calls and some broken windows at Murray’s home at 83 Chestnut Street in Cranston. 3 That afternoon, Meseck received three more phone calls from DePetrillo. Two calls indicated that he was on the bus and then on foot, headed to Meseck’s house looking for a fight, and another call informed Meseck that DePetrillo had just “shot up” Meseck’s house. Between the second and third phone calls, Lawrence Saraceno, James Monteiro, James McArdle, and Tim Santiago 4 waited for DePetrillo to arrive at the house they shared with Meseck at 33 Peach Avenue 5 in Providence. Saraceno, Monteiro, and Santiago waited on the porch, while McArdle watched through the living-room window. 1', 'On June 14, 2010, the first day of trial, counts 3 and 4 were dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2', 'The record alternately refers to this witness as both “Francis” and “Frances” Meseck. 3', 'Murray’s sister, Erin L.

Chum, becoming angry at Santiago for smiling at him, told Tep to shoot the men on the porch. Tep took a gun out of the pocket of his hooded sweatshirt, pointed it, and shot once, hitting the porch and the door. Saraceno testified that he thought Tep was “focused on—at, in my mind, hitting one of us.” The three men on the porch then ran inside the house. Although no one was hit by the bullet, Monteiro was hit with splinters of wood as the bullet went through one of the posts on the porch railing. After Tep fired the gun, he and Chum ran from the scene. McArdle called 911, and police officers arrived shortly thereafter. Officer Jeffrey Richards, one of the first to arrive, testified that all three of the men who were at the house appeared “very nervous.” 8 At trial, Officer Richards recalled what McArdle said to him when he arrived at the scene:', '“[McArdle] stated two Asian males walked up to them on Peach', 'Street, one of the male subjects with a shiny jacket stated—I don’t', 'know exactly the words, but he stated that your boys smashed our', 'boys’ windows last night and he said, ‘Shoot these boys’ or ‘Shoot', 'these guys,’ which the second Asian male with the hooded jacket', 'pulled out a weapon and shot one round into the front door of', 'Peach Ave.” 6', 'Chum was charged in the same criminal information as Tep, but their cases were tried separately.

Traveling in an unmarked police car, Officer Bucci went to 83 Chestnut Street in response to the dispatcher’s direction that the suspects may have been heading there. Once on Chestnut Street, Officer Bucci saw a red Acura, occupied by two Asian males. He testified that, when he made eye contact with the driver, the driver’s eyes “became wide” and “the vehicle sped off and began traveling at a high rate of speed.” Officer Bucci pursued the car, and after he stopped it, the passenger exited the car and the driver moved to the passenger seat.

First, Tep contends that the trial justice abused his discretion when he admitted McArdle’s hearsay statement into evidence as an excited utterance. Tep argues that the trial justice admitted the testimony without first requiring a proper foundation, and that because Richards was a police officer, admission of the hearsay testimony unfairly bolstered the complainants’ allegations. 10 Second, Tep contends that the trial justice abused his discretion when he allowed Saraceno to testify about Tep’s mental state at the time of the shooting.

The Rule 803(2) hearsay exception applies to out-of-court statements “relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.” The rationale for this exception is based on “the belief that at the time the declarant makes the statement, he or she is still under the strain of the startling event that triggered the statement, with little or no opportunity to deliberate or prevaricate.” State v. Momplaisir, 815 A.2d 65, 70 (R.I. 2003). In determining whether a statement is an excited utterance, this Court has rejected “a blind obedience to a clock and an hour-by-hour count of the time that has passed between the event and the declaration.” State v. Creighton, 462 A.2d 980, 983 (R.I. 1983). Rather, we have stressed that the crux of the determination is “whether from a consideration of all the facts the trial justice is satisfied that the declarant was still laboring under the stress of the nervous excitement when he or she spoke.” Id.', 'Here, Officer Richards testified that McArdle made the statement at issue immediately after he arrived at the Peach Avenue house. He testified that, when he arrived, all three of the men who were at the house appeared “very nervous.” Additionally, he specifically described', '-6- McArdle’s demeanor as both “nervous” and “shaken up.” Tep argues that the state did not lay a proper foundation before the trial justice admitted Officer Richards’s testimony as an excited utterance. However, in a sidebar conference, the trial justice overruled Tep’s objection because (1) he was “satisfied that [Officer Richards] arrived almost immediately after the report of shots fired at [Peach Avenue],” and (2) he was convinced by “the demeanor of the individuals, particularly McArdle, [who was] shaken up and nervous.”', 'Given the trial justice’s stated reliance on these factors, we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit McArdle’s statement as an excited utterance. We therefore affirm the trial justice’s ruling on this point.', 'B', 'Saraceno’s Lay-Witness Opinion Testimony', ""Tep next argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he admitted Saraceno’s statement as lay-witness opinion testimony pursuant to Rule 701 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Rule 701 limits testimony by witnesses who are not qualified as experts to only “those opinions which are (A) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (B) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” Thus, “[a] lay witness may not invade the jury's fact-finding role by proffering an opinion, unless that opinion is based upon personal perception and helps the jury.” Mann, 889 A.2d at 168 (citing State v. Barrett, 768 A.2d 929, 940 (R.I. 2001))."", 'At trial, Saraceno testified that Tep “aimed” the gun at him and the other men on the porch and that Tep was “focused on—at, in my mind, hitting one of us.” Tep argues that this statement indicated what Saraceno believed to be Tep’s mental state at the time of the shooting. We disagree. Saraceno’s statement merely described what he perceived, not what he believed Tep thought or intended. Observing Tep’s demeanor and the pointed gun, Saraceno rationally', '-7- concluded that Tep was aiming at the men on the porch. It is unnecessary to require an expert to testify about what a lay individual could rationally conclude. We also note that Tep did not object when, shortly before, Saraceno testified that the gun “was aimed right at me, basically. That’s the way I saw it.” Both statements described what Saraceno perceived while looking at Tep, but Tep only objected to the latter. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when admitting Saraceno’s statement as lay-witness opinion testimony, and we affirm the trial justice’s ruling on this point.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '-8-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

125,"City of Newport : v. : Local 1080, International Association of : Firefighters, AFL-CIO. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, the City of Newport (the city) provides health insurance benefits to its retired firefighters. 1 After the city decided to modify those benefits, Local 1080, International Association of Firefighters, AFL-CIO (the union), filed grievances and sought arbitration. The city responded by seeking relief in Newport County Superior Court to determine the arbitrability of disputes over changes to these benefits. The Superior Court determined that this dispute was not arbitrable. The union disagreed and petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.', 'Having granted the petition, we heard this matter on September 20, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the case at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set 1', 'We spell “firefighter” as one word throughout this opinion even though it is sometimes spelled as “fire fighter” in various materials in the record.', '-1- forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and quash the writ of certiorari previously issued.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The parties do not dispute the essential facts of this case. The city and the union are parties to a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) covering the period from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2005. 2 Among other things, the CBA requires the city to provide health insurance coverage to active firefighters. Article 14 of the CBA specifies the type and extent of the agreed-upon coverage and states that this coverage “shall also be available to retired members of the Newport Fire Department.”', 'On January 14, 2008, the city sent a letter to active and retired firefighters who were covered under the HealthMate plan. In that letter, the city’s Human Resources Administrator, Michael J. Coury, outlined certain changes to the health coverage for both active and retired firefighters. In response to this letter, on January 25, 2008, the union filed two grievances that contested the city’s decision to change the health coverage it provided to retired firefighters. The first grievance asserted that the city had violated Article 14 of the CBA by unilaterally changing retirees’ health benefits. The second grievance asserted that the city had violated Article 14 by requiring Stephen Kirwin, a retired firefighter, to submit copays for his health coverage. The union sought arbitration of these two grievances under Article 18 of the CBA and notified the city of its demand for arbitration on February 26, 2008. 2', 'The record does not reveal the date on which the city and the union entered into the CBA. Both parties submitted unsigned copies of this agreement in the proceedings before the Superior Court, and the effective date of the contract was not made clear in either party’s papers or during the hearing in Superior Court. Because neither party disputes the CBA’s validity, the effective date of the CBA need not concern us.', '-2-', 'About one month later, on March 26, 2008, the city filed a complaint against the union in Newport County Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the city asked the Superior Court to preliminarily enjoin the arbitration and to issue a judgment declaring that the grievances were not arbitrable. The union moved to dismiss the city’s complaint on April 15, 2008, arguing that the complaint was untimely under state law; that the city had not joined necessary parties (as required by the Declaratory Judgments Act); and that the grievances were, in fact, arbitrable under the CBA. The city timely objected, reiterating its assertion that the Superior Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims contained within the grievances.', 'The parties appeared before a Superior Court justice on August 8, 2008, for a hearing on their respective requests. After hearing from both parties, the hearing justice rejected the union’s arguments and concluded in a bench decision that the grievances were not arbitrable. She also found that retired firefighters were not necessary and indispensable parties to the complaint. Accordingly, in an order entered on September 25, 2008, the hearing justice denied the union’s motion to dismiss and granted the city’s request for injunctive relief.', 'The union appealed to this Court on August 20, 2008. In a prebriefing conference held on June 16, 2009, a justice of this Court observed that the language of the Superior Court’s order of September 25, 2008, was unclear and suggested that the matter be remanded to the lower court for clarification. On October 21, 2009, we entered an order to that effect. Specifically, our order directed the Superior Court to enter a new judgment that clarified its disposition of the city’s request for a declaratory judgment.', 'See City of Newport v. Local 1080, International Association of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, 981 A.2d 1020 (R.I. 2009) (mem.).', 'Thereafter, the Superior Court issued an amended judgment, which was entered on April 22, 2010. The judgment granted declaratory relief to the city, stating that “[p]ursuant to the', '-3- [CBA], a firefighter is ‘an active, full-time, permanent, paid firefighter for the [city].’” It further stated that “[r]etired firefighters are not firefighters within the embrace of the CBA and, therefore, their grievances are not arbitrable under the CBA.”', 'On February 23, 2011, the union petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Superior Court’s amended judgment. 3 We granted the petition on June 20, 2011.', 'II', 'Issues Presented for Review', 'The merits of the city’s decision to change retired firefighters’ health benefits are not at issue here. Rather, we are asked to decide whether the CBA includes an agreement to arbitrate disputes over changes to these benefits. The union asserts that such disputes are arbitrable and also argues that, because retired members of the union were not joined as parties to the action in Superior Court, the hearing justice erred in granting the city declaratory relief. In response, the city contends that neither the CBA nor state law allows arbitration of grievances concerning changes to retired firefighters’ healthcare coverage. The city also denies that retired members of the union are necessary parties to this action. This Court will first address whether the trial justice erred in concluding that retired firefighters who would be affected by the city’s decision were not necessary and indispensable parties to the complaint. 3', 'The clerk of the Supreme Court closed the case when it was remanded to Superior Court. The union moved to reopen the case on November 1, 2010. We denied that motion in an order entered on February 11, 2011, but indicated that the union could seek review of the Superior Court’s amended judgment by way of a petition for a writ of certiorari.', '-4-', 'III', 'Joinder of Necessary Parties', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'Rhode Island’s Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provides that “[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.” G.L. 1956 § 9-30-11. “[W]ith respect to the ultimate decision by a trial justice to grant or deny declaratory relief, our standard of review is deferential.” Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009). On appeal, therefore, we will leave such a decision undisturbed unless the trial justice clearly abused his or her discretion or committed an error of law. See id. (citing Hagenberg v. Avedisian, 879 A.2d 436, 441 (R.I. 2005)).', 'B', 'Analysis', 'In rejecting the union’s motion to dismiss the complaint for, among other things, failure to comply with § 9-30-11, the hearing justice determined that “the retirees affected by [the city’s] decision * * * are not necessary and indispensable parties to the complaint.” She noted that “[t]he [u]nion, as the collective bargaining unit, has the sole interest in determining the scope of the arbitration provision.” We agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that retired firefighters were not necessary and indispensable parties to the complaint even though they would be affected by the city’s decision to modify their healthcare benefits. We emphasize that, in this action, our review is focused not on the merits of the city’s decision to change retired firefighters’ health benefits, but on whether disputes over that decision are arbitrable. The CBA', '-5- allows only the union itself to submit grievances to arbitration; individual firefighters (let alone retired firefighters) may not do so. 4 Because only the union itself can submit a dispute to arbitration, joinder of individual firefighters was unnecessary. We therefore affirm the hearing justice’s conclusion on this issue and now review her ruling as to the arbitrability of the dispute.', 'IV', 'Arbitrability of the Dispute', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews de novo the legal question of whether a dispute is arbitrable. AVCORR Management, LLC v. Central Falls Detention Facility Corp., 41 A.3d 1007, 1010 (R.I. 2012) (citing State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d 1241, 1247 (R.I. 2005)). Mindful that “[a]rbitration is a matter of contract,” we apply “[g]eneral rules of contract construction.” Id. (quoting Radiation Oncology Associates, Inc. v. Roger Williams Hospital, 899 A.2d 511, 514 (R.I. 2006)). Since “a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which [it] has not agreed so to submit,” the issue of arbitrability “turns upon the parties’ intent when they entered into the contract from which the dispute ultimately arose.” Id. (quoting Radiation Oncology Associates, Inc., 899 A.2d at 514).', 'B', 'Analysis', 'In the ordinary contract-interpretation case, our starting point would be the contract itself. See Haffenreffer v. Haffenreffer, 994 A.2d 1226, 1238 (R.I. 2010) (“The first step of contract 4', 'Article 18 of the CBA, entitled “Grievance Procedure and Arbitration,” provides that “if Local 1080 is not satisfied with the decision [of the City Manager] they may submit the grievance to arbitration * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', '-6- interpretation is to determine whether the writing is clear or ambiguous.”). Here, however, because the CBA is a product of a state statute, we must first examine the contract in light of that legislation. In 1961, the General Assembly enacted the Fire Fighters Arbitration Act (FFAA), G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 28, as enacted by P.L. 1961, ch. 149, § 1. The statement of policy underlying the FFAA provides as follows: “It is declared to be the public policy of this state to accord to the permanent uniformed members * * * and all employees of any paid fire department in any city or town all of the rights of labor other than the right to strike or engage in any work stoppage or slowdown. To provide for the exercise of these rights, a method of arbitration of disputes is established.”', 'Section 28-9.1-2(b).', 'The Legislature established this method of arbitration “to provide some alternative mode of settling disputes where employees must, as a matter of public policy, be denied the usual right to strike.” Section 28-9.1-2(c). The FFAA thus embodies a compromise: it takes away from firefighters the right to strike, but gives them an alternative form of dispute resolution through which to resolve disagreements with municipal officials.', 'The FFAA contains additional provisions that control the relationship between firefighters and municipal officials. Among other things, the statute grants firefighters the right to organize and bargain collectively, obligates municipalities to recognize labor organizations as bargaining agents for firefighters, and requires municipalities to “meet and confer in good faith” with union officials to engage in collective bargaining. See §§ 28-9.1-4; 28-9.1-5; 28-9.1-6. The CBA, then, draws its authority from the FFAA—as do all collective-bargaining agreements between firefighters’ unions and Rhode Island municipalities. The statute is thus essential to our analysis in this case.', '-7-', 'In Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379 (R.I. 2007), we gave further guidance as to how the FFAA affects retired firefighters. In that case, this Court considered, as an issue of first impression, “[w]hat body has jurisdiction to determine the status of [retired firefighters’] legal right to * * * disputed COLA benefit[s].” Id. at 387. We stated that “[t]he ordinary meaning of ‘firefighter’ and the definition included in the FFAA cannot reasonably be construed to include retirees. * * * Retired firefighters * * * no longer are ‘permanent uniformed members’ of the fire department.” Id. at 389 (quoting § 28-9.1-2(b)). Additionally, we noted that “the sound public policy underlying the FFAA’s enactment does not apply to retirees in the same compelling way that it applies to current employees.” Id. For these reasons, we held that “the term ‘firefighter’ in the FFAA does not and cannot include retirees.” Id. at 390. 5', 'Keeping the FFAA and Arena’s holding in mind, we now proceed to examine the CBA to determine whether the parties intended to arbitrate grievances involving disputes over retiree health benefits. Several provisions of the CBA shed light on this analysis. Article 3(j) states that “[w]henever used in this agreement, the terms ‘member,’ ‘employee’ or ‘fire fighter’ shall have the same meaning, which is: active, full-time, permanent, paid fire fighters * * *.” Retired firefighters are not included in this definition.', 'Other provisions that are also helpful to our analysis appear in Article 18, which sets forth a grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of certain disputes. Article 18 of the CBA defines a “grievance” as “any violation or breach of this agreement or a violation of a statute, City Charter provision or ordinance applicable to this agreement and appeals from disciplinary action.” The next sentence states that “[t]he purpose of the grievance procedure is to 5', 'We noted in Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 390 n.11 (R.I. 2007), that “[n]othing [in our decision] precludes retirees from engaging in permissive bargaining with or through their former union and employer.” Such bargaining, however, would require the express assent of the retirees, the bargaining agent, and the municipal officials.', '-8- settle Firefighter grievances arising as defined above * * * as quickly as possible to assure efficiency and high morale.” This sentence is critical to our analysis for two reasons. First, it operates to limit the scope of arbitrable grievances to those involving “Firefighters” as defined in Article 3. Second, it parallels the FFAA’s establishment of an arbitration procedure as a method of dispute resolution that minimizes disruption among active employees. See § 28-9.1-2(b).', 'There is further support in Article 18 for the conclusion that the union may not arbitrate disputes regarding retired firefighters. Article 18 lists certain steps that the union must follow before initiating a grievance. As the first step of that grievance procedure, “[t]he Firefighter or Firefighters involved * * * would meet with the Supervisor, Officers or Deputy Chief, immediately to attempt to resolve the grievance.” This provision limits grievances to those involving “Firefighter(s),” which, as noted above, the CBA defines as active, full-time, permanent, paid firefighters. It thus confirms our conclusion that grievances involving retired firefighters are not arbitrable under the CBA.', 'The union correctly observes that this Court resolves doubts as to the arbitrability of disputes in favor of arbitration. School Committee of North Kingstown v. Crouch, 808 A.2d 1074, 1078 (R.I. 2002) (citing Brown v. Amaral, 460 A.2d 7, 10 (R.I. 1983)). However, this presumption in favor of arbitration applies only when there is uncertainty about the arbitrability of a dispute—it does not operate to steer disputes into arbitration where, as here, the parties have clearly agreed against arbitration. AVCORR Management, LLC, 41 A.3d at 1012 n.11. Because our review of the CBA convinces us that the parties did not intend to arbitrate disputes regarding retiree healthcare, we hold that such disputes must be resolved, if at all, judicially rather than through arbitration. See Rhode Island Court Reporters Alliance v. State, 591 A.2d 376, 377 (R.I. 1991) (“[A] court shall rule in favor of submitting a dispute to arbitration unless the arbitration', '-9- clause of the collective-bargaining agreement cannot be interpreted to include the asserted dispute * * *.”) (citing United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582-83 (1960)).', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the writ of certiorari previously issued and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

On appeal, he contends that the trial justice committed reversible error in (1) failing to adequately instruct the jury on how to assess the credibility of the state’s witnesses; (2) failing to instruct the jury that a history of drug abuse may weaken the credibility of a testifying witness; and (3) denying his motion for a new trial. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we discern no error on the part of the trial justice and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 26, 2010, Ricci was charged by indictment with one count of burglary in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1 (count 1), one count of robbery in the first degree in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a)(3) (count 2), and one count of assault on a person over the age of sixty in', '-1- violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-10 (count 3), 1 all stemming from a confrontation that allegedly occurred on December 18, 2009, at the North Kingstown home of the complainant, Francis Quinn (complainant or Quinn). The Attorney General also presented Ricci as a habitual offender under G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21. 2', 'On September 30, 2010, a Washington County Superior Court jury found Ricci guilty on all three counts. Thereafter, the trial justice sentenced him to thirty years in prison, with twenty years to serve, ten years suspended, and ten years probation on count 1; thirty years, with twenty years to serve, ten years suspended, and ten years probation on count 2; and ten years to serve on count 3. The sentences imposed were to run concurrently. Additionally, at sentencing, the trial justice declared Ricci to be a habitual offender, and accordingly imposed a consecutive sentence of fifteen years, with ten years to serve before becoming eligible for parole.', 'During the trial, which commenced on September 28, 2010, the state called five witnesses: Quinn; Walter French, a former friend of Ricci’s; Britny Loiselle, a prostitute who visited Quinn’s home with Ricci two evenings prior to the incident in question; and two members of the North Kingstown Police Department, Det. Tyler Denniston and Sgt. Jason Clark. The witnesses testified to the following relevant facts.', 'The complainant, Quinn, who was seventy-one years old at the time of trial, had suffered a stroke in 2008 and consequently “couldn’t remember a lot of things.” He testified that he took prescription medication daily. On the night of December 18, 2009, Quinn was asleep at his 1', 'On count 3, the original indictment incorrectly charged defendant with violating G.L. 1956 § 11-5-20, rather than § 11-5-10. We pause to note that although the state later filed an “amended indictment” correcting this error in open court, and defense counsel did not object, it is unclear from the record whether defendant himself consented to the “amended indictment” in accordance with Rule 7 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2', 'It appears from our review of the record that the Attorney General did not present Ricci as a habitual offender either within forty-five days of the arraignment or prior to the date of the first pretrial conference, as required by the statute. However, this issue is not before us on appeal.', '-2- home in North Kingstown.', 'He suddenly awoke when an intruder broke into his home and “knocked [him] on the floor and had [him] by the throat.” Consistent with what he told police immediately after the incident, Quinn testified that he recognized the voice of the intruder and concluded that it was Ricci. According to Quinn, Ricci’s voice was “clear as can be * * * saying ‘where’s your f---ing money?’”', 'Quinn’s witness statement given to police on the night of the attack did not mention that he actually recognized the intruder other than by his voice. In fact, when asked by police that night if he could describe anything the intruder was wearing, Quinn answered, “No, he had me by the throat.” Nevertheless, Quinn did identify Ricci as his attacker when shown a photo array on the night in question at the police station; and, when asked at trial if he was able to actually see the intruder during the incident, Quinn testified: “Yeah.”', 'According to Quinn, during the attack, Ricci exclaimed, “You got tons of money motherf---er, get me the money!” He then “grabbed [Quinn’s] wallet from his pants” and stole the contents, which totaled approximately $40. Quinn testified that the entire attack lasted for approximately two minutes before the intruder “booked it” and left. Quinn then dialed 911, but not before he first “put [his] glasses on * * * so [he] could read.” 3 As a result of the attack, he sustained injuries to his face and arms, but did not require any medical attention.', 'Further, Quinn testified that he first became acquainted with Ricci sometime in 2003, when Ricci frequently visited Quinn’s neighboring female tenant. Quinn would see him “quite often.” After the female tenant moved out, he did not see Ricci again until December 16, 2009, two nights before the crimes at issue. On that night, Ricci arrived at Quinn’s home with a female prostitute, later determined to be Britny Loiselle, whom Quinn had never seen before. “[Ricci 3', 'Quinn testified that he was not wearing glasses at the time of the attack.', '-3- and Loiselle] were banging on the door” and when Quinn opened it, they “walked right in.” Ricci asked him for money, which he said was for Loiselle. In exchange for the money, he told Quinn that “you can go to bed with [Loiselle].” While inside Quinn’s bedroom, Loiselle offered to have sex with him. Quinn testified that he did not remember having intercourse with her, but that he gave her $20. Before Ricci and Loiselle left his home, Quinn testified that Ricci gave him a piece of paper with his name and number on it, telling Quinn to “call me at this number any time you need anything.” 4', 'Loiselle was subpoenaed and testified at trial that she had indeed arrived at Quinn’s home with Ricci “late at night” on December 16, 2009. Although Quinn testified that he could not remember whether he had intercourse with Loiselle that night, she testified that she had in fact “exchanged sex for money” with him. Loiselle further testified that it was she, not Ricci, who wrote Ricci’s name on the paper given to Quinn so that he could “contact us.” She did not recall, however, if she had written Ricci’s phone number on that piece of paper. Loiselle further testified that she and Ricci went back to Quinn’s home one or two nights later to “get more money” and again knocked on his door. However, when Quinn did not answer the door, they left. Loiselle testified that she never returned to Quinn’s home after that night. 5', 'She further testified that “sometime around Christmas” of 2009, she had a conversation with Ricci. He told her to “keep [her] f---ing mouth shut because he left a piece of paper with [her] name up at [Quinn’s] house saying that [she] had done something with him.” Ricci then told her that he had gone to Quinn’s home and accused him of hurting Loiselle and told Quinn that “he was going to call the cops if [Quinn] didn’t give him money.” Loiselle further testified 4', 'This paper, admitted as a trial exhibit, was later retrieved by the North Kingstown Police Department on the night in question after police responded to Quinn’s 911 call. The police confirmed that the phone number belonged to Ricci. 5', 'It is undisputed that Loiselle was not involved with the crimes at issue in this case.', '-4- that she did not know about the crimes at issue in this case until she later saw Ricci “on the news.”', 'Loiselle admitted that, at the time of trial, she was a recovering drug addict and that she had previously been addicted to crack cocaine. However, on cross-examination by defense counsel, she testified that she was not presently under the influence of any drugs and that she did not have any difficulties answering questions.', 'Walter French testified for the state that he had known Ricci for “[p]robably over ten” years. One night in December 2009, Ricci came to his house appearing “a little shaken up” and “a little nervous.” Ricci told him that “he had just heard that his picture was on ‘Rhode Island’s Most Wanted’ on the TV.” Ricci then asked French if he could stay at his house for the night. French allowed Ricci to sleep in a car.', 'On direct examination, French repeatedly denied that Ricci ever mentioned anything to him about the crimes at issue. When specifically asked by the prosecutor if he “remember[ed] telling us that [Ricci] * * * told [him] he robbed the guy in North Kingstown,” French responded: “No.”', 'Following a brief court recess, French resumed his testimony. Treating French as a hostile witness, the prosecutor again asked French if Ricci had told him: (1) that he broke into Quinn’s home; (2) that he covered his face so that Quinn would be unable to see him; and (3) that he was nervous because he spoke to Quinn during the robbery and thought that Quinn might have recognized his voice. Recanting his earlier testimony, French responded: “Yes,” to each query.', 'Counsel for defendant cross-examined French, inquiring whether, during the court recess, he “ha[d] the opportunity to confer with the prosecution or members of law enforcement.”', '-5- French responded: “Yes.” He also testified that, during the court recess, the prosecutor told him that he “could be committing perjury by lying.” French then testified that he was “involved with probation” and that he “d[idn’t] want to go back to jail.”', 'In an effort to expose possible bias, defense counsel then asked French about a series of “love” letters he had sent to Ricci’s girlfriend, Cynthia Heller, which sought to persuade her to leave Ricci for him. In the letters, he expressed that he wanted to hurt Ricci “like he [had] hurt [him].” He also wrote that Ricci is “going to be down,” meaning incarcerated, for “whatever he’s got hanging.” He further testified on cross-examination that he remained “angry with [Ricci]” because “he took something from me that can’t be replaced.”', 'At trial, French acknowledged his lengthy criminal record. During cross-examination, he further testified that he was a recovering drug addict. He testified that, among other things, he had smoked crack cocaine and “injected” powdered cocaine. However, he testified that his use of these drugs did not affect his memory.', 'Detective Tyler Denniston of the North Kingstown Police Department testified that he responded to Quinn’s 911 call. When he arrived at Quinn’s home, Quinn explained that Ricci “was on top of him, choking him when he woke up, and that they were in a struggle and that the struggle went down to the floor, at which point [Ricci] told him he wanted money and [then] he took $40 from a wallet and left.” Detective Denniston determined that the attacker had entered through an unlocked window in the back spare bedroom, and he noted that Quinn had “scratch marks” and “abrasions.”', 'Detective Denniston testified that he then transported Quinn to the North Kingstown police station, where he took a formal witness statement in which Quinn recounted the attack and again stated that Ricci was the attacker. He testified that Quinn did not have any trouble', '-6- remembering or articulating what had happened that night when giving the witness statement, although Quinn did mention to him that he previously “had suffered from a stroke.”', 'At the station, Det. Denniston provided Quinn with a six-photo array and issued him a standard written instruction that the photos might or might not include a picture of the person Quinn had named as his attacker. After reviewing the photos, Quinn “immediately recognized” Ricci and identified him as the man who had attacked him. 6', 'Thereafter, a warrant was issued for Ricci’s arrest. According to Det. Denniston, once arrested and apprised of his rights, Ricci stated that he “had not seen Quinn in a couple of years.” At the time of the arrest, Ricci was in possession of Loiselle’s birth certificate, as well as numerous documents belonging to others. 7', 'Sergeant Jason Clark also testified that he arrived at Quinn’s home later that night to process the crime scene. Sergeant Clark also determined that the attacker had gained entry to Quinn’s home through the unlocked window. He testified that plastic insulation that had covered the window was damaged from the outside going inward. He noted that dust had been freshly disturbed on the window frame, although no identifying evidence was developed from any fingerprints. He further testified that he found a blood droplet in the hallway between the front door and Quinn’s bedroom.', 'However, the blood droplet was never processed for any identification.', 'Following the state’s case in chief, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which the trial justice denied. The defense then rested. 6', 'At trial, Quinn pointed to Ricci when asked if he saw his attacker in the courtroom. 7', 'It is unclear from the record why or how Ricci was in possession of these items. Loiselle testified that she had never given Ricci her birth certificate.', '-7-', 'Prior to the close of the case, defense counsel filed a written request for jury instructions. Relevant to this appeal, defense counsel requested that the jury instructions include specific language instructing the jury to “[c]onsider the witness’ ability to observe the matters as to which he or she has testified and consider whether he or she impresses you as having an accurate memory or recollection of these matters” (Instruction 3). As discussed below, the trial justice did not include this exact language in his final instructions to the jury.', 'Counsel for defendant also submitted an additional request for jury instructions pertaining specifically to the testimony of Walter French. In this supplemental request, defense counsel urged the trial justice to instruct the jury that “[t]he testimony of a drug abuser must be examined and weighed by the jury with greater care that [sic] the testimony of a witness who does not use drugs. The jury must determine whether the testimony of the drug abuser has been affected by drug use or the need for drugs. * * * Walter French may be considered to be an abuser of drugs, and I instruct you to weigh his testimony more carefully than you would the testimony of a witness who does not abuse drugs” (the Drug-Use Instruction).', 'The trial justice refused to give the Drug-Use Instruction to the jury, stating that there was “absolutely no evidence before this jury that would suggest that * * * a drug addict is less credible.” The trial justice also noted that defendant had offered no expert testimony on this issue. Moreover, the trial justice pointed out that no Rhode Island case law had been cited requiring any jury instruction relative to drug users.', 'The trial justice then proceeded with his instructions to the jury. Just prior to the close of his instructions, and outside the presence of the jury, he sought from counsel “objections to the charge, suggested additions, [and] corrections.” Defense counsel specifically objected to the trial justice’s omission of Instruction 3, as well as to the trial justice’s refusal to give the Drug-Use', '-8- Instruction. The trial justice noted counsel’s objections, but stated that “the subject matters of the requested charge not included [were] fairly covered by other instructions [he] gave to the jury.”', 'The jury returned guilty verdicts on all three counts.', 'Ricci timely filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. That decision was memorialized in a written order entered on December 15, 2010. Thereafter, Ricci timely appealed to this Court. On appeal, defendant challenges: (1) the failure of the trial justice to instruct the jury with respect to his proposed jury instructions, Instruction 3 and the Drug-Use Instruction; and (2) the trial justice’s denial of the new trial motion.

We will discuss each in turn.', 'i', 'Defendant’s Proposed Instruction 3', 'We hold that the trial justice did not err in refusing to explicitly instruct the jury that, in assessing credibility, it could consider a witness’s ability to observe and recall.', 'Notably, in his instructions to the jury, the trial justice suggested that the jurors use the “same tests that [they] use every day” in assessing the credibility of the witnesses. “[W]ithout limiting the generality” of that, he then proposed numerous factors for the jury to consider. (Emphasis added.) These factors included the intelligence, age, appearance, conduct, demeanor, frankness, and candor of the witness, as well as whether the witness seemed interested in the outcome. These factors also included whether the witness was biased or would have had a motive to be truthful or untruthful.', '-10-', 'The trial justice instructed the jury to “consider * * * any consistencies or inconsistencies between what a witness testified to at trial and what that witness may have said at an earlier time.” Moreover, he further instructed the jury to consider the probability or improbability of the truth of the witnesses’ testimony and to consider the presence of corroborating or contradictory evidence. Additionally, and of import, he instructed the jury to “consider the ability of the witness to relate, the memory of the witness,” and whether the witness was “in a position to see or hear or sense that which she or he claims she heard.”', 'We are satisfied that the instructions given adequately informed the jurors of their role in assessing witness credibility. Furthermore, it is well settled that “[c]ounsel rather than the court are the appropriate agents to argue to the jury concerning the specific credibility or lack thereof of a particular witness.” State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1168 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Fenner, 503 A.2d 518, 525 (R.I. 1986)). Counsel for defendant had a full opportunity to cross- examine each of the testifying witnesses and to argue to the jury at closing about any deficiencies in credibility.', 'Although we find no fault with proposed Instruction 3, we repeat that the trial justice “need not use particular words” in instructing the jury. Cipriano, 21 A.3d at 423 (quoting Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1030).

Barnes, 559 A.2d 136, 140 (R.I. 1989).', 'Here, we note that defense counsel had a full opportunity to confront and cross-examine both Loiselle and French with respect to their drug use. In an effort to undercut their credibility, counsel for defendant raised the prior drug use and drug addictions of these witnesses during cross-examination.', 'Both testified that they had previously used drugs and that they were recovering drug addicts. However, each further testified on cross-examination that any prior drug use did not affect his or her memory or his or her ability to remember the facts in question. Additionally, during closing argument, defense counsel reminded the jury that French “illegally bought [drugs] on the street.”', 'We remain fully convinced that it is the very purpose of both direct and cross- examination to provide the jury with a “meaningful basis upon which credibility assessments can be made.” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1168. Indeed, it is axiomatic that the fundamental role of counsel in our adversarial system of justice is to utilize these potent tools to convince the jury of the respective party’s contentions at trial. The jury was fully apprised of the fact that Loiselle and French were both acknowledged drug addicts, especially on cross-examination by defense counsel. This Court will not speculate about whether the jury found defense counsel’s cross- examinations persuasive in assessing witness credibility. We further note that “[i]t is not the function of a trial justice to act as [an] advocate for either the prosecution or the defense.” Id. at 1167 (quoting Fenner, 503 A.2d at 525).', 'Here, the jury instructions were broad.', 'The jury was instructed to “determine for [them]selves the reliability or unreliability of [the witnesses’] statements.” Indeed, the trial', '-12- justice instructed the jurors to use the “same tests that [they] use every day * * * in a variety of contexts” when assessing witness credibility. As such, the jury was free to decide, in reflecting on the totality of each witness’s testimony, whether to weigh drug use as a factor in assessing credibility.', 'Moreover, the trial justice noted that no evidence was introduced to suggest that the testimony of a drug addict was somehow less credible than the testimony of someone who was not a drug addict. 8 Furthermore, it is well settled that “a trial justice should avoid reciting instructions that might be construed as commentary on the quality or credibility of particular evidence.” State v. Hadrick, 523 A.2d 441, 444 (R.I. 1987).

However, if the trial justice disagrees with the jury’s verdict, he or she then must conduct a subsequent fourth step to “determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice. If the verdict meets this standard, then a new trial may be granted.” Id. at 290-91 (quoting State v.

In the trial justice’s written order denying the motion for a new trial, he stated that Quinn “recognized the burglar as the [d]efendant by his voice and sight in the dim light.” (Emphasis added.) Ricci points out that the witness statement given by Quinn to the police on the night of the attack did not mention that he had recognized Ricci by sight. Rather, Quinn had told police that he recognized Ricci’s voice.', 'However, Quinn did testify at trial that a ceiling light in the hall lit up his room and that he saw Ricci during the attack. Moreover, on that night, Quinn quickly identified Ricci in a photo array, concluding that Ricci was his attacker. Further, at trial, Quinn pointed to Ricci when asked whether his attacker was present in the courtroom. Notwithstanding this evidence, Ricci avers that, since Quinn testified that he needed to put on his glasses before first dialing 911, it was unlikely that he was actually able to visually identify him during the attack.', 'Ricci further maintains that Quinn’s capacity to recall had been damaged by his stroke, and, as a result, Quinn “mistakenly identified” him as the attacker.

Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011).

At first, he repeatedly denied that Ricci had ever told him anything about the crimes at issue. It was not until after a brief court recess, during which Ricci suggests the prosecution must have threatened French with a probation violation, that French recanted his prior testimony. After the recess, French suddenly claimed that Ricci nervously had admitted to him that he had broken into Quinn’s home and feared that Quinn had recognized his voice.

The defendant, Gerrit Musterd, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for first-degree murder and three related crimes. On appeal, Musterd argues that the trial justice erred in denying his pretrial motions to suppress evidence; he also contends that the trial justice improperly denied his motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal.', 'After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we discern no error on the part of the trial justice and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 2, 2009, Officer John Brown of the Pawtucket Police Department responded to Newell Avenue in Pawtucket to investigate a call regarding “a black male that was sleeping or slumped over in a vehicle.” Upon arrival at the scene, Officer Brown saw a vehicle with the bloodied body of a black male inside. There appeared to be a bullet wound in the back of the victim’s head. Shortly thereafter, a rescue captain determined that the man was dead. Officials later identified the decedent as Michael Benson. Benson had recently been released', '-1- from prison, and when his body was found, he was wearing an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. At the time his body was discovered, a detective found marijuana in the back of his vehicle. Two days later, on September 4, 2009, police searched Benson’s home pursuant to a warrant and recovered about $72,000 in cash.', 'Several days later, on September 13, 2009, a woman who identified herself as “Dawn” called the police department and notified a dispatcher that she had information concerning the recent murder. 1 Sergeant Dennis Lefebvre returned her call several minutes later. The woman identified herself as Dawn Edmonds and told Lefebvre that she knew who had committed the murder. She gave Lefebvre certain information about that individual, such as his physical description, where he worked, what kind of car he drove, and his cell phone number. She said that although she knew the man as “Joe,” she was unsure of his exact name. Edmonds informed Lefebvre that in August and September of 2009, she was living with Nicole Meireles, whose boyfriend was Gerrit Musterd—the man Edmonds knew as Joe Rodrigues. 2', 'Edmonds’s criminal history was reviewed in some detail at trial, both on direct examination and cross-examination. She testified that, when she contacted Officer Lefebvre, she told him that she had a warrant out for her arrest and was concerned about going to jail. Edmonds had several pending charges against her when she contacted the police department. She later resolved those charges and entered into a cooperation agreement with the Attorney General.', 'At trial, Edmonds testified that, in August 2009, Musterd asked her if she could get him some black sweatpants and gloves, explaining that he needed to “handle something.” When she 1', 'The transcript reveals that the prosecutor initially identified the date in question as September 13, 2010 (not 2009), but later corrected his mistake. 2', 'As we note below, Musterd later told police that “Joe Rodrigues” was his alias.

Edmonds testified further that, on some later date, Musterd asked her if she had watched the news. 3 When she replied that she had not, he told her: “I did it. I handled it. I put two bullets into him. * * * He’s dead.” Edmonds described Musterd’s demeanor that day as “nervous” and “shaken up.” Musterd told Edmonds that his boss, Joey, had paid him $5,000 for the murder and that he had purchased a blue Buick Century with the money. 4', 'On September 14, 2009, Edmonds went to the police department and gave a statement to detectives that memorialized what she had told Lefebvre the day before. The detectives then asked her to call Musterd’s cell phone. Although that call did not yield any information, Musterd called the police station three times that day after Edmonds called him—perhaps curious about why Edmonds had called him from the police department. Recordings of those calls were played for the jury at trial, 5 and a detective testified that the caller identified himself as Gerrit Musterd. During these conversations, Musterd told the police that he worked at a gym and was an undocumented immigrant from the Netherlands.', 'He told them that he was living as “Joe Rodrigues” because that was the name his birth parents gave him.

Feeling nervous, she replied that she was seeing probation officials about a court date, went inside, and gave a detective the recording device.', 'Shortly thereafter, detectives directed that Musterd be stopped and arrested.', 'Police arrested Musterd at about 2 p.m. He was interviewed at the station shortly after 5 p.m. that afternoon. After several hours of questioning, Musterd gave a statement to the police in which he confessed to the murder. Musterd explained that his boss at the gym, Julio Reverdes, whom he knew as “Joey,” had asked him to kill Benson because Reverdes owed Benson a debt for drugs. 7 The next day, on September 18, 2009, Musterd signed a waiver of his right to prompt presentment to court under Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and accompanied police officers to Boston so that he could point out the spot on the shoreline adjacent to a body of water where he told them he had discarded the murder weapon. 8', 'In October 2009, a grand jury indicted Musterd on charges of first-degree murder in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1 (count 1), discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-47-3.2(a) and 11-47-3.2(b)(3) (count 2), 6', 'Edmonds testified that Musterd was the person with whom she spoke outside the gym, and a detective testified that he observed Edmonds exit the gym and converse with a person who met Musterd’s description. 7', 'Julio Reverdes (whose last name is spelled in the record alternately as “Riverdes”) was not named in the indictment, but the indictment refers to an unnamed, unindicted coconspirator.

Their cumulative version of the facts was consistent with the trial testimony described above. 10 The trial justice stated that he had “no question” that probable cause existed to support Musterd’s arrest on September 17, 2009.', 'After reviewing the record and taking into account all the circumstances surrounding Musterd’s arrest, this Court is of the opinion that the trial justice properly denied the motion to suppress. As of September 2, 2009, the police knew that someone had murdered Michael Benson. Less than two weeks later, Edmonds called the police and told them that she knew who had committed the murder. Edmonds revealed several details about Musterd, whom she knew as Joe Rodrigues. She also told them that he had made incriminating statements to her. According to a detective who testified at the pretrial hearing, Edmonds told the police a detail about Benson’s murder that had not been released publicly. 11 On September 14, 2009, Edmonds called Musterd from the police station; and, although that call failed to yield any information related to the crime, officers learned more about him when he later called the police station. They learned that his name was Gerrit Musterd, that his alias was Joe Rodrigues, and that he was an undocumented immigrant. A few days later, on September 17, 2009, officers observed Edmonds meet with a man who fit Musterd’s description (Edmonds had described him as a black male); they met at the gym where Edmonds said he worked, and he was driving a blue Buick Century, as Edmonds described. After this meeting, Edmonds drove to the police station to return the recording device, and moments later, Musterd arrived there and confronted her. Officers arrested him shortly thereafter. 10', 'No testimony was offered on events that occurred after Musterd was arrested, however. 11', 'Specifically, she told them that Musterd had told her he shot the victim twice.', '-7-', 'These circumstances lead us to conclude that, when the police arrested Musterd, probable cause existed to take him into custody without a warrant.', 'Edmonds’s information about Musterd, coupled with Musterd’s own statements and actions, furnished ample reason to believe that he was responsible for the murder of Michael Benson. Concluding that probable cause existed to support Musterd’s arrest, we perceive no error on the part of the trial justice in denying the motion to suppress for that reason.', 'We now turn to Musterd’s two additional arguments supporting his motion to suppress. Regardless of whether probable cause existed to support his arrest, he contends that, because the Pawtucket police failed to properly present him in court, and because they engaged in “trickery and lying” during his interrogation, the trial justice should have granted his motion to suppress his confession and evidence derived from it.', 'B', 'Motion to Suppress—Confession', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“When ruling on a motion to suppress a confession, the trial justice should ‘admit a confession or a statement against a defendant only if the state can first prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his [or her] constitutional rights expressed in Miranda v. Arizona.’” State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1179 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 835 (R.I. 2008)). We employ “a two-step analysis” in reviewing such a ruling. Id. (quoting State v.

If a statement was “extracted from the defendant by coercion or improper inducement, including threats, violence, or any undue influence that overcomes the free will of the defendant,” it is involuntary. Id. at 974-75 (quoting Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274). When reviewing de novo the voluntariness of a confession, this Court considers “the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged statement.” Robinson, 989 A.2d at 975 (quoting Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274). We must consider not only whether a defendant’s statement was made voluntarily, but also whether it was made knowingly and intelligently—that is, “with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.” State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 734 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Leuthavone, 640 A.2d 515, 519 (R.I. 1994)).', '2', 'Analysis', 'Here, Musterd’s motion to suppress is directed at the statement he gave to the police after he was arrested on September 17, 2009. 12 At the suppression hearing, a detective testified that, on the day Musterd was arrested, he was brought to the police station at approximately 2 p.m. He was then booked and processed over the course of thirty to forty minutes. Before beginning 12', 'The motion was not directed at the statements Musterd made when he called the police station before he was arrested. In addition, defense counsel did not dispute the legality of the search of Musterd’s car (conducted by officers after his arrest based on Musterd’s signed consent form).', '-9- his interview shortly after 5 p.m., officers apprised him of his Miranda rights. They used a printed form, read Musterd his rights, and asked him whether he understood those rights. Musterd signed the waiver form, indicating that he understood his rights and that he wanted to speak with the police. According to the detective’s testimony, when the police asked him if they could record his statement, Musterd replied that he would rather not be on tape and that he preferred the statement to be typed.', 'Nevertheless, detectives videotaped a portion of the interview.', 'The transcript of that videotaped portion indicated that Musterd reviewed his statement with detectives before they typed out a final version for his editing, approval, and signature.', 'During this portion of the interview, Musterd explained in great detail why he committed the murder. 13', 'The trial justice issued a bifurcated ruling with respect to the admissibility of Musterd’s statement.', 'First, he considered whether Musterd gave that statement knowingly and intelligently. The trial justice noted that Musterd was given a printed rights form, was orally apprised of his Miranda rights, and initialed that form to acknowledge his understanding of those rights. The trial justice rejected Musterd’s argument that the surreptitious recording of his statement—after he had expressed a preference that it be typed rather than recorded—rendered that waiver unknowing and unintelligent. Accordingly, the trial justice concluded that Musterd had given his statement knowingly and intelligently.', 'Second, the trial justice considered whether Musterd’s statement was voluntary. Musterd’s counsel argued that it was involuntary for two reasons: first, because police had 13', 'Musterd explained that his boss at the gym, Julio Reverdes, asked him to kill Benson because Reverdes owed Benson money and feared that Benson might kill him over the debt. Musterd knew that Reverdes was having money troubles, and he worried that he would be out of a job if Reverdes had to sell the gym. Musterd had himself borrowed money from Reverdes, so he felt obligated to commit the murder.', '- 10 - videotaped Musterd after he told them he did not want to give a videotaped statement; and second, because the police had delayed in presenting him to court. The trial justice rejected both of these contentions and ruled that Musterd had given his statement voluntarily. Having found that Musterd’s statement was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, the trial justice denied Musterd’s motion to suppress that statement.', 'We agree with the trial justice’s conclusion that any delay in presentment did not affect the voluntariness of Musterd’s statement to the police. When police officers make a warrantless arrest, Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires law enforcement officials to “take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before a judge of the District Court.” “[T]his Court views Rule 5(a) as ‘a prophylactic measure designed to prevent other constitutional infirmities.’” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1181 (quoting State v. King, 996 A.2d 613, 621 (R.I. 2010)). “[O]ur well-settled case law with respect to Rule 5(a) unambiguously indicates that a defendant who seeks to have an inculpatory statement suppressed because of an unnecessary delay in presentment ‘must demonstrate both: (1) that the delay in presentment was unnecessary and (2) that such delay was “causative” with respect to’ the making of the inculpatory statement.” Id. at 1182 (quoting King, 996 A.2d at 622). Applying this test, the trial justice found that “the delay in no way affected the statements that [Musterd] gave.” 14', 'Likewise, we also agree with the trial justice’s finding that the surreptitious recording of Musterd’s statement, after Musterd had expressed a preference that officers memorialize his statement through typing and not recording, could not serve as a basis upon which to exclude it from evidence. At the suppression hearing, Musterd’s counsel argued that the secret recording of 14', 'The trial justice did not specifically address whether any delay in presentment was unnecessary; but, given that the trial justice found that any delay was not causative with respect to Musterd’s statement, it was unnecessary for him to make a specific finding on this ground.', '- 11 - his statement to the police affected both prongs of the Miranda analysis; that is, whether the statement was voluntary and whether it was knowing and intelligent. The trial justice found that, notwithstanding the surreptitious recording, Musterd gave his statement knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.', 'We perceive no error with the trial justice’s conclusion on either prong of the Miranda analysis. As to the first prong of the analysis, we are satisfied that Musterd knowingly and intelligently waived his rights. “[A] knowing and intelligent waiver may be executed when a defendant is apprised of the Miranda warnings, comprehends such warnings, and thereafter makes a voluntary statement.” Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 735 (citing Berghuis v. Thompkins, 130 S. Ct. 2250, 2262 (2010)). The record supports the trial justice’s conclusion that, since Musterd was advised of his rights, understood those rights, and then spoke to the police of his own accord, he knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights.', 'As to the second prong of the Miranda analysis, we are similarly convinced that Musterd gave statements to the police “because [he] wanted to”—in other words, that his statements were voluntary. The trial justice characterized the interview as “a free-flowing dialogue that the defendant very much wanted to be a part of.” The trial justice noted several cases from other jurisdictions in which courts found that statements of a defendant were given voluntarily even though police recorded those statements against the defendant’s wishes. 15', 'Rhode Island precedent does not speak to this precise issue, but the United States Supreme Court has held that “[e]vents occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely 15', 'See Woods v.

Another case which the trial justice cited has since been reversed by a higher court. See Lee v. State, 975 A.2d 240, 255 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2009), rev’d, 12 A.3d 1238, 1251 (Md. 2011).', '- 12 - can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 422 (1986). Because Musterd was unaware that the police were recording his statements, that fact has no bearing on whether he voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. Moreover, we note that Musterd did not expressly forbid police from recording his interview; rather, he merely expressed a preference that his statement be typed rather than recorded.', 'In these circumstances, we decline to hold that Musterd’s knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights was later vitiated when the police recorded a portion of his statement without his knowledge.', 'C', 'Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'Lastly, Musterd argues that the trial justice erred when he denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. These motions challenged the legal sufficiency of the evidence. In deciding whether to grant a motion for a new trial, the trial justice may exercise his or her “independent judgment to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Navarro, 33 A.3d 147, 156 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011)). By contrast, in ruling on a motion for a judgment of acquittal, the trial justice must “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640). Where, as here, a defendant appeals the trial court’s rulings on both types of motions, this Court first evaluates the ruling on the new-trial motion. Id. (citing Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640). If our review of the evidence adduced at trial shows that the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction under the standard applicable to a new-trial motion, it follows', '- 13 - that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal. See id. (citing Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640).', '1', 'Motion for a New Trial', '“When deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror.” Navarro, 33 A.3d at 156 (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640-41). “The trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). If the trial justice has set forth sufficient reasoning to support his or her ruling, this Court “accord[s] great weight” to that ruling on appeal. Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). We will not reverse the trial justice’s decision unless “we are convinced that [he or she] committed clear error or * * * overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Id. at 156-57 (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641).', 'To support his argument that the trial justice should have granted him a new trial, Musterd presses only one point. He contends that Edmonds’s testimony on cross-examination indicates that her conversation with Musterd, in which he told her that he was looking for a gun, took place after the murder was committed. 16 This observation fails to take into account that her 16', 'During this portion of Edmonds’s cross-examination, Musterd’s counsel referred Edmonds to the statement she gave to police on September 14, 2009. The following exchange then took place:', '“Q: * * * So, I had asked you earlier about your statement', 'in there about where you say about a week ago, you were', 'home and that’s when Joe told you about this. Correct? We', 'spoke of that?', '“A: Yes.', '- 14 - testimony on direct examination made clear that this conversation took place in August 2009, sometime after Musterd originally asked her for dark clothing but before the murder occurred on September 2, 2009. Given that Musterd’s own statements corroborated Edmonds’s account to the police, we cannot say that the trial justice committed clear error in finding that this inconsistency on cross-examination was outweighed by the rest of the evidence adduced at trial. 17', 'The trial justice neither committed clear error nor overlooked or misconceived material or relevant evidence when he denied Musterd’s motion for a new trial. We therefore affirm his ruling on this motion and turn to whether he properly denied Musterd’s motion for a judgment of acquittal.', '2', 'Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', '“We review a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal using the same prosecution-deferential standard as the trial court applies.” Navarro, 33 A.3d at 158 (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 642). Under this standard, “[if the evidence] is sufficient to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion must be denied.” Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 642). Since we hold that the evidence here is “sufficient to withstand the more stringent review applicable to a motion for a new trial, it follows that the evidence * * * [is] also sufficient', '“Q: And then, later on in that same sentence of the', 'document you just read and you signed, you said that he', 'told you that he was waiting for a gun at that time, correct?', '“A: Mm hmm.” (Edmonds later made clear that her answer', 'to the preceding inquiry was yes.) 17', 'In denying Musterd’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice noted that “Edmonds was subjected to lengthy and severe cross-examination and her credibility was fully tested.

And I, as a front-row observer, have no qualms about their having accepted her testimony as credible.”', '- 15 - to withstand a motion for a judgment of acquittal.” Id.

The defendant, Yara Chum (Chum or defendant), appeals from a conviction of two felony counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence. The defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years imprisonment for each of the felony assault counts and a consecutive ten-year sentence on the firearm conviction, with five years to serve, five years suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant attacks his conviction on two fronts. First, relying on Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963), he contends that his statement to police should have been suppressed as the tainted fruit of his unlawful arrest. Second, the defendant argues that the trial justice deprived him of his right of confrontation by prohibiting defense counsel from cross-examining two police witnesses concerning his statements to police. After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case has its genesis in a drug deal gone awry. In the early morning of March 1, 2009, Frances Meseck, Jr. (Meseck)1 agreed to sell to his soon-to-be ex-friend Matthew DePetrillo (DePetrillo) a quantity of marijuana. Meseck drove to the Chestnut Avenue area in Cranston, Rhode Island, to meet DePetrillo.', 'Unexpectedly, however, DePetrillo was accompanied by another man, who was unknown to Meseck. Both men entered Meseck‟s car and, while DePetrillo and his friend examined the marijuana, Meseck drove around the block. When the would-be buyers indicated their willingness to make the purchase, Meseck pulled into a nearby driveway to consummate the deal.', 'Before any money changed hands, however, DePetrillo‟s friend grabbed the marijuana, exited the car, and bolted down the street. DePetrillo informed a stunned Meseck that he had just been robbed. Meseck responded by driving after DePetrillo‟s companion, while DePetrillo jumped out of the moving vehicle.', 'Shortly after losing his merchandise, Meseck decided to even the score and enlisted the help of his friend, James Monteiro (Monteiro). The two men drove to 83 Chestnut Avenue in Cranston, where Erin Murray (Murray), a friend or associate of DePetrillo, resided. At that point, Meseck telephoned DePetrillo and told him that, if the marijuana was not returned or paid for within ten minutes, Meseck and Monteiro would smash the windows of Murray‟s house on 83 Chestnut Avenue. When DePetrillo refused to comply with Meseck‟s demands, Meseck and Monteiro made good on their threats―a tire iron and a brick crashed through the windows at 83 Chestnut Avenue.', 'At the time of these events, Meseck was living in a multifamily duplex at 33 Peach Avenue in Providence with Monteiro, James McArdle (McArdle), Lorenzo Saraceno (Saraceno), 1', 'Meseck himself spelled his first name as “F-r-a-n-c-e-s.”', '-2- and others. The dispute between Meseck and DePetrillo moved to Providence. When Meseck was visiting his parents‟ house in Scituate, Rhode Island, he received a call from DePetrillo, informing him that he was on his way to 33 Peach Avenue and looking for a fight. DePetrillo warned Meseck that he was “going to kick in [his] door with a .44 and shoot [him].” Meseck hastily returned to Providence and called Monteiro to warn the residents of 33 Peach Avenue of the impending threat.', 'Armed with this news, McArdle, Monteiro, and Saraceno positioned themselves on the front porch of 33 Peach Avenue, as two vehicles, a white Acura and a maroon-colored Acura, slowly passed the residence. McArdle recognized DePetrillo as the man in the white Acura who was pointing at the house. Within minutes, McArdle, Monteiro, and Saraceno watched as two Asian males approached the house. The record discloses that the taller of the two males later was identified by these witnesses as defendant. The other man was identified as Samnang Tep (Tep), who was named as a codefendant.', 'As the men drew near, defendant asked, “Which one of you broke my home girl‟s window?” When Monteiro replied that the absent Meseck was responsible, the men turned to leave. More words were exchanged between the two groups, however, and defendant eventually told Tep to shoot the men on the porch. Tep pulled out a gun and fired a single shot in the direction of the porch, hitting the porch railing.2 After Tep fired, he and defendant ran away; McArdle called 911.', 'Cranston Police Department Patrolman Anthony Bucci (Ptlm. Bucci) was notified by dispatch that a shooting had occurred in Providence and that two suspect vehicles―a white 2', 'Although the record discloses that McArdle was on the porch when defendant and Tep first approached 33 Peach Avenue, at the time of the shooting McArdle had retreated into his house and was standing at the bay window.', '-3- Acura and a red Acura―driven by Asian males had fled the scene. Patrolman Bucci was further informed that the vehicles might be traveling to the area of Magnolia Street and 83 Chestnut Avenue.', 'After exchanging his marked police cruiser for an unmarked car, Ptlm. Bucci proceeded to the Chestnut Avenue area. Within minutes of his arrival, Ptlm. Bucci spotted a red Acura, driven by an Asian male, proceeding in the opposite direction. As Ptlm. Bucci turned his vehicle around, the Acura quickly turned off Chestnut Avenue without a turn signal being used; and the car temporarily disappeared from Ptlm. Bucci‟s view.', 'When Ptlm. Bucci next observed the Acura, it was parked at the side of Oakland Avenue, in the vicinity of Chestnut Avenue. As the passenger exited the vehicle, the driver moved into the passenger seat. Patrolman Bucci pulled behind the Acura, exited his vehicle, and approached the passenger, who was standing at the side of the road. Patrolman Bucci recognized this man as defendant. The defendant and Tep, the driver of the vehicle, were placed in custody.', 'Later that evening, Providence Police Detective Michael Otrando (Det. Otrando) interviewed defendant. The defendant was seated at a conference table without handcuffs or other restraints. Detective Ronald Riley, Jr. (Det. Riley) and Ptlm. Bucci also were present. After Det. Riley advised defendant of his Miranda rights, defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights and indicated so on the rights form. Detective Otrando informed defendant that he had been positively identified as having been involved in the shooting.

Bucci if he knew when defendant had been advised of his Miranda warnings. The state objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection. Defense counsel then proceeded with cross-examination without protest.', 'The state also called Det. Otrando to discuss the photo arrays from which McArdle, Monteiro, and Saraceno identified defendant and Tep. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Det. Otrando whether he had responded to the scene of the shooting. The state‟s objection to this question was sustained. Defense counsel then asked Det. Otrando, “When you arrived at 33 Peach [Avenue], you interviewed three individuals, correct?” The trial justice again sustained the state‟s objection.

At the same time, however, this Court reviews “a trial justice‟s determination of the existence or nonexistence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion on a de novo basis.” Taveras, 39 A.3d at 646 (quoting State v. Abdullah, 730 A.2d 1074, 1076 (R.I. 1999)); see Flores, 996 A.2d at 160.', 'We review a challenge to a trial justice‟s limitation on cross-examination under an abuse of discretion standard, and we will not disturb the exercise of that discretion absent a clear abuse of discretion.

To constitute a clear abuse of discretion, the trial justice‟s ruling excluding the evidence must amount to “prejudicial error.” State v. Stansell, 909 A.2d 505, 510 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Oliveira, 730 A.2d 20, 24 (R.I. 1999)).', '-7-', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant offers two reasons why his conviction should be overturned. First, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement because it was obtained as a result of an unlawful arrest. Second, defendant asserts that the trial justice violated his right of confrontation and right to a fair trial by restricting his counsel‟s cross-examination of Ptlm. Bucci and Det. Otrando. We reject these contentions.', 'I', 'Motion to Suppress', 'For the first time in these proceedings, defendant raises a Fourth Amendment challenge to the admissibility of his confession. He argues that there was no probable cause to support his arrest by Ptlm. Bucci and that the Miranda warnings did not attenuate the taint of this purported illegal arrest, thereby making his statement the fruit of Wong Sun‟s storied poisonous tree. See Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 487-88. In addition to the fact that this argument is not properly before us, the statement was not introduced into evidence.', 'At no point during defendant‟s trial did the state introduce into evidence the statement he gave to the Providence police. Thus, the issue concerning the trial justice‟s denial of the motion to suppress―either on Fourth or Fifth Amendment grounds―is not a proper subject on appeal. See State v. Huy, 960 A.2d 550, 554 (R.I. 2008) (“For us to address Huy‟s contention that the contraband and confession were obtained illegally, the evidence must have been introduced at trial.”); 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 3 at 37 (2008) (“Courts are to decide a case only on the evidence in that particular case. A matter which was not introduced or presented as evidence at trial does not come within the commonly accepted definition of „evidence.‟ In this regard,', '-8- neither testimony nor physical objects are evidence unless they are produced, introduced, and received in a trial.”).', 'Our conclusion squarely comports with the prophylactic purposes that underlie the exclusionary rule.', 'See Huy, 960 A.2d at 556.', 'As we explained in Huy, “if the alleged improperly obtained evidence has not been admitted at trial, there is nothing that the exclusionary rule can accomplish.', 'In such a case, the deterrent function served by the exclusionary rule has no place.” Id. So it is here.', 'To be sure, the prosecutor referred to defendant‟s statement in his opening statement to the jury. Although defendant desperately clings to this fact, it affords him no harbor because statements of counsel are not evidence. See State v. Tevay, 707 A.2d 700, 702 (R.I. 1998). The record discloses that the trial justice instructed the jury before the opening statements and again at closing arguments that statements of counsel were not evidence. It is well settled that this Court presumes that the jury follows a trial justice‟s adequate cautionary instruction. See State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 197 (R.I. 2012); State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 61 (R.I. 2011). The trial justice‟s instructions in this case plainly were adequate.', 'Furthermore, when, as in this case, a prosecutor makes an unfulfilled promise in opening statement about the evidence that will be put before the jury, a criminal defendant has several avenues available to address the issue. Defense counsel can remind the jury during closing argument that the prosecutor promised that certain evidence would be admitted and that the evidence never materialized. See State v. Perry, 779 A.2d 622, 626-27 (R.I. 2001) (holding that the trial justice erred in prohibiting defense counsel from arguing to the jury that the prosecutor promised in opening statement that a certain witness would be called to testify and that witness did not appear). Additionally, when it becomes clear that the prosecutor has suggested evidence', '-9- in the opening statement that was never adduced at trial, defense counsel can seek a mistrial or, in the alternative, a curative instruction. Id. at 628. In this case, defense counsel failed to use any of these mechanisms.', 'Moreover, defendant‟s contention that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress suffers from yet another fatal flaw. In his motion to suppress, defendant asserted that his statements “were procured in violation of rights secured to the defendant by Article I, Sections 10 and 13 of the Rhode Island Constitution and by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and in violation of the protections of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).” The defendant failed to cite either the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution. Whether his arrest was lawful and based on probable cause, therefore, is not before us.', 'In State v. Brennan, 526 A.2d 483, 487 & n.1 (R.I. 1987), the defendant argued for the first time on appeal that his statements should have been suppressed because of his unlawful arrest. This Court deemed the issue waived. Id. at 487. Similarly, in State v. DeWitt, 423 A.2d 828, 829-30 (R.I. 1980), the defendant contended that his confession was the tainted fruit of his unlawful arrest. Before the hearing justice, however, the defendant had argued only that his statement should be excluded because it was coerced. Id. at 830. We therefore refused to consider his Fourth Amendment contentions on appeal because those arguments were not raised at trial. Id.', 'Notwithstanding defendant‟s failure to preserve this issue, our careful review of the record satisfies us that his contention is without merit. The test for probable cause is well established. It calls for', '“an objective assessment in which the examining court determines,', 'under the totality of the circumstances, whether „the facts and', '- 10 -', 'circumstances within * * * [the officers‟] knowledge and of which', 'they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in', 'themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief', 'that an offense has been or is being committed.‟” Flores, 996 A.2d', 'at 161 (quoting Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, 372 n.2', '(2003)).', 'Under this standard, Ptlm. Bucci had ample probable cause to arrest defendant. He received a call from dispatch shortly after the shooting that a white Acura and a red Acura driven by Asian males had left the scene of the shooting and might be headed to the area of Magnolia Street and 83 Chestnut Avenue. Within minutes of his arrival, Ptlm. Bucci saw a red Acura driven by an Asian male. As he turned his vehicle around, the Acura turned and sped away. When Ptlm. Bucci next observed the vehicle, it was stopped on the street; the passenger, another Asian male, exited the vehicle as the driver transferred to the passenger side. To an experienced police officer, this is suspicious behavior. The totality of these circumstances, including Ptlm. Bucci‟s corroboration of several details of the police dispatch, coupled with the actions of the occupants of the Acura, warranted an officer of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense had been committed and that defendant was the one who committed it. See Flores, 996 A.2d at 161. Therefore, we are satisfied that Ptlm. Bucci had probable cause to arrest defendant.', 'II', 'Limitation on Cross-Examination', 'The defendant next argues that, by prohibiting his counsel from questioning Det. Otrando and Ptlm. Bucci concerning defendant‟s statement, the trial justice deprived him of his right to confront witnesses and denied him a fair trial. We discern no error.', 'A criminal defendant has a “well-established, constitutionally-protected right * * * to effective cross-examination of the prosecution‟s witnesses.” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 198. This bedrock constitutional safeguard is embodied in the confrontation clauses of both the Sixth', '- 11 - Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Rights of the Rhode Island Constitution, article 1, section 10. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 575 (R.I. 2009). Although the right to confront one‟s adverse witnesses may be vital, cross-examination is not unbounded. See Stansell, 909 A.2d at 510.', '“[T]rial justices are accorded wide discretion to curtail cross- examination after there has been „sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.‟” Id. (quoting Oliveira, 730 A.2d at 24).', 'In this case, the trial justice precluded cross-examination of Det. Otrando concerning defendant‟s statement because it was inadmissible hearsay.', 'Although defense counsel responded, “Okay. That‟s fine, Your Honor[,]” defendant takes a different tack in this Court. The defendant now argues that his statement was not hearsay, even if offered through police witnesses on cross-examination, because the statement was an admission of a party-opponent under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. We disagree.', 'At the outset, we note that defendant has not properly preserved for our review any challenge to the trial justice‟s limitations on his cross-examination. In State v. Hazard, 785 A.2d 1111, 1115-16 (R.I. 2001), we explained:', '“When a trial justice sustains an objection to a line of inquiry on', 'cross-examination and opposing counsel fails to make an offer of', 'proof, fails to request any voir dire of the witness, and fails to', 'articulate any reason why the court should reconsider its ruling,', 'then that party cannot, on appeal, question the trial justice‟s ruling', 'in sustaining the objection as reversible error.” Defense counsel in this case failed to comply with any one of these preservation mandates.', 'Nonetheless, the contention lacks merit. Rule 801(d)(2)(A) provides that “[a] statement is not hearsay if: * * * [t]he statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party‟s own statement, in either the party‟s individual or a representative capacity * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Here, defendant‟s statement to police does not fall within Rule 801(d)(2)(A); while it was his', '- 12 - own statement, it was not offered against him. See State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532, 535 (R.I. 1994) (affirming trial justice‟s determination that the defendant‟s statements to police were not admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(B) when the defendant sought to elicit statements from several police officers).', 'Moreover, the trial justice properly refused to permit cross-examination concerning defendant‟s statement because it was beyond the scope of the state‟s direct examinations of Det. Otrando and Ptlm. Bucci. Rule 611(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that “[c]ross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.” In this case, Ptlm. Bucci testified on direct examination about the circumstances of defendant‟s arrest. Detective Otrando was, in the trial justice‟s words, “offered for very close and discrete reasons; identification of photographs only.” Therefore, defendant‟s statement to police was outside the scope of the direct examinations of both of these police witnesses.', 'Indeed, defendant concedes that both attempted inquiries were beyond the scope of direct examination; but he contends, nevertheless, that the trial justice abused his discretion under Rule 611(b). First, defendant asserts that the evidence may have led to further evidence concerning whether the statement was voluntary under Rhode Island‟s Humane Practice Rule. See State v. Tassone, 749 A.2d 1112, 1117-18 & n.7 (R.I. 2000) (outlining contours of Humane Practice Rule). Second, defendant argues that, if his statement had been admitted, he would have been able to point out the inconsistencies between that statement and trial evidence.5 Both of these arguments are unavailing: the statement was not introduced into evidence, and a defendant in a 5', 'Specifically, defendant attaches significance to the fact that his statement identified Vang Chhit, and not Tep, as the shooter.', '- 13 - criminal case is not entitled to have his version of events introduced through the testimony of other witnesses.', 'In Harnois, a case in which the defendant was unable to elicit his out-of-court statements through the police witnesses, we explained that:', '“The defendant did not take the stand at trial. He may not', 'testify by other means, including by way of the unsworn', 'statements made to police. * * * By choosing to exercise his Fifth', 'Amendment right, defendant waived all rights to testify. * * * The', 'defendant was seeking to offer testimony through his statements,', 'which might raise reasonable doubt in the minds of a jury, yet', 'would deprive the state of the opportunity of cross-examination.', 'The rules of evidence will not be manipulated in this way.”', 'Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535-36. This Court has reaffirmed Harnois on several occasions. See, e.g., State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 622 (R.I. 2012) (“As was his absolute right, defendant chose not to take the stand at trial, but after having made that decision, „[h]e may not testify by other means, including by way of the unsworn statements made to police.‟” quoting Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535-36); Hazard, 785 A.2d at 1119; see also State v. Bustamante, 756 A.2d 758, 763-64 (R.I. 2000) (affirming the trial justice‟s refusal to allow the defendant to elicit his statements through the testimony of a police officer because it “would permit defendant to introduce his own statements into evidence without taking the stand, thus depriving the prosecutor of the opportunity to cross-examine the proponent of those statements, defendant himself”).', 'Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly precluded the defendant from eliciting his statement to police during the cross-examination of Det.

See G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii), (iv). As to respondent-father, DCYF alleged that he was unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the child, such as institutionalization, including imprisonment, of such a duration as to render it improbable for the father to care for the child for an extended period and that respondent-father abandoned the child. See § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i), (a)(4). Concerning both parents, DCYF alleged that respondents had been offered or received services to correct the situation that led to the child‟s placement. See § 15-7-7(a)(3).', 'The DCYF‟s involvement in this case began on June 29, 2009, only two days after Amiah tested positive for cocaine at birth. On that date, DCYF filed a neglect petition against respondent-mother concerning Amiah.3', 'Subsequently, a paternity test established that respondent-father, who was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) at that time, was, in fact, Amiah‟s father.

That case plan was mailed to respondent- father.', 'Ms. Jawharjian learned the identity of Amiah‟s biological father sometime in February or early March 2010. Biweekly visitation with Amiah at the ACI was initiated at that time. The respondent-father was advised to participate in as many programs offered at the ACI as possible. Thereafter, respondent-father provided Ms. Jawharjian with his certificates from parenting, domestic violence, and substance abuse programs. Ms. Jawharjian indicated that she maintained contact with respondent-father and provided him with information about Amiah‟s progress and well-being.', 'Meanwhile, in March 2010, Ms. Jawharjian spoke with respondent-mother, whom she encouraged to seek shelter at a domestic violence center because she was engaged in yet another abusive relationship. Ms. Jawharjian and respondent-mother also discussed moving respondent- mother into a residential treatment program to address her substance abuse. At that time, respondent-mother acknowledged to Ms. Jawharjian that it was doubtful that she would be able to care for Amiah given her persistent and chronic problems stemming from substance abuse. Later, on June 25, 2010, Ms. Jawharjian informed respondent-mother that DCYF intended to file a termination petition based on her failure to make sufficient progress toward reunification.

Ms. Jawharjian characterized Amiah as a “happy, healthy, young girl.” The child‟s foster family wanted to adopt her, but did not want an open adoption.5', 'When respondent-father testified, he indicated that he enjoyed his visits with Amiah, whom he described as his “little pride and joy,” and that he wanted to raise her in spite of the fact that he had never lived with her. He testified about his participation in the GED program and his successful completion of a Spectrum Health Systems drug program, anger management programs, meditation and stress reduction programs, an HIV-prevention course, and a parenting class. He went on to discuss his newfound religion and subsequent baptism, as well as his participation in the Learning To Live Initiative, which focuses on reading and understanding the Bible. He indicated that he engaged in these programs principally for case-planning purposes: “[t]hat way [], when [he] did come to court * * *, [the court] won‟t terminate [his] rights,” and he “wanted to have a chance at least with [his] daughter.”6 5', 'Ms. Jawharjian testified that she explored the option of placing Amiah with relatives, but because of criminal histories and other factors concerning these relatives, Ms. Jawharjian declined to do so. 6', 'The respondent-father also testified about his son, aged thirty-three and living in New York. He indicated that he has kept in touch with his son after raising him with the son‟s mother. There is no other evidence in this record about this relationship.', '-4-', 'In terms of any future planning for Amiah, respondent-father had little to offer; he stated that he planned to call his caseworker to see what programs or counseling he ought to complete. Further, he testified that, while in prison, he was in touch with his landlady, who told him she would give him a two-bedroom apartment upon his release from prison. He also stated that a friend would give him a job in an auto body shop. As for raising Amiah, respondent-father said his six sisters, who have children of their own, would assist him in caring for the child.7 Specifically, according to respondent-father, he has “six sisters who [have] kids who will help [him] raise [his] daughter, and they have no problem with that.” Further, he testified that he has a niece who is DCYF-licensed and who “will take [the child] now.”', 'With regard to his criminal history, respondent-father testified about the number of times he was sentenced to prison, including four years beginning in 1988, one year in 1992 for possession of cocaine, six years beginning in 1996 for delivery of cocaine, six months in 2003, and a ninety-day stint in 2007 for driving on a suspended license. He also indicated that his current incarceration came about from a plea of nolo contendere to felony domestic assault against respondent-mother in November 2008. He received a twelve-year sentence at the ACI, six years to serve and six years suspended, with probation. According to respondent-father, his scheduled release date was in 2014, but he hoped for an early release date of May 2012 based on credit for good time.', 'When respondent-mother took the stand, she did not testify in her own defense and apparently made no effort to contest the termination of her parental rights.

This is my instructions from my client when I‟m sitting at counsel table.” The trial justice refused to permit this testimony, declaring: “Well, then that‟s not playing here, [counsel]. If you‟ve got something to defend your client with, fine; if you don‟t, rest.”', 'The respondent-mother next testified that she had been in and out of prison in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island since Amiah‟s birth.8 The witness conceded that she has spent “[m]aybe a year” of the last two years in prison, a period, the court noted, that amounted to half of Amiah‟s life. At the conclusion of counsel‟s direct examination of respondent-mother, she volunteered that “[e]verybody makes mistakes.” When the trial justice asked whether respondent-mother made more than one mistake, she replied, “a lot of mistakes.”', 'The trial justice delivered an oral pronouncement on June 20, 2011, and he issued a written decree on August 4, 2011, terminating the parental rights of both parents. The trial justice found that both parents presented troubling histories involving imprisonment and drugs; he specifically found that respondent-mother was incarcerated for a period in November 2010 and that respondent-father had been sentenced to twelve years with six to serve for felony domestic assault upon respondent-mother. According to the trial justice, at best, respondent- father would be released sometime in 2012. The trial justice also found that Amiah had been in foster care for nearly two years and that she had bonded with her foster family.

In addition, respondent-father contends that the trial justice erred in failing to address whether DCYF made reasonable efforts by offering services to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship. Additionally, respondents both argue that the trial justice erred when he precluded respondent-mother from testifying that she made false allegations about respondent-father‟s assault upon her because that offense was the underlying charge for which respondent-father was incarcerated at the time of Amiah‟s birth. The parents contend that this testimony was both relevant and admissible concerning respondent-father‟s parental fitness and in determining Amiah‟s best interests.', 'Standard of Review', '“On appeal, „[t]his Court reviews termination of parental rights rulings by examining the record to establish whether the [Family Court] justice‟s findings are supported by legal and competent evidence.‟” In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 83 (R.I. 2006)). “These findings are entitled to great weight, and this Court will not disturb them unless they „are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.‟” Id.

Although this Court has held that a parent must be given an opportunity to present evidence of his or her parental fitness, In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1175, respondent-mother is not contesting the termination of her own parental rights in this appeal. Therefore, the reliance on the analysis of the Connecticut Supreme Court in In re Christina M. is misplaced and unpersuasive.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in excluding respondent-mother‟s testimony that she was the aggressor in the criminal case for which respondent-father was jailed. “This Court has stated that „[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.‟” State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 150 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 411 (R.I. 2008)). “This Court will not interfere with the trial justice‟s evidentiary decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent,” id., and we can discern no such abuse. The respondent-mother‟s allegation that the trial justice erred in limiting her efforts to defend respondent-father is unavailing.', 'Termination of Respondent-Father’s Parental Rights', 'As the trial justice noted, respondent-father presents a different situation. The facts underlying the termination of respondent-father‟s parental rights give rise to a more challenging analysis relative to the question of parental rights and parental unfitness and a more complex analysis of the grounds upon which the termination of parental rights is warranted in this case.', '-9- We acknowledge at the outset that this is a much closer case.', 'The trial justice declared that respondent-father “is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental for the child” and “his incarceration * * * is of such a duration to render it improbable for him to care for the child for an extended period of time.” The respondent-father urges this Court to conclude that the trial justice erred when he found respondent-father to be unfit. The respondent-father also contends that the termination of his parental rights based on his incarceration and abandonment of Amiah was in error.', 'We note that respondent-father additionally argues that the trial justice erred in making no finding as to DCYF‟s reasonable efforts to provide services to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship. We need not address this argument. The Family Court decree indicates that “the [c]ourt finds by clear and convincing evidence that [DCYF] has proven the allegations as set forth in the petition[;]” the allegation to which the decree refers is the allegation that “parents were offered or received services to correct the situation.” We have determined that these “services” may be offered by the agency or received elsewhere, and the record clearly reflects that respondent-father participated in a variety of programs and services at the ACI. See In re Raymond C., 864 A.2d 629, 634 (R.I. 2005) (noting that “[§ 15-7-7] does not require that DCYF be the sole provider of services to the parents”).', 'In our opinion, based on the facts in evidence, the trial justice was not clearly wrong in finding respondent-father to be unfit under § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i).', 'Although the fact of the incarceration of a parent is not a sufficient ground to terminate one‟s parental rights, we have held that “the extended length of a parent‟s incarceration is, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i), in and of itself, grounds to terminate parental rights.” In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d 498, 503 (R.I. 2006). Indeed, when incarceration “is combined with other factors, such as the probable duration of incarceration, there may be sufficient grounds to support a finding of unfitness.” In re Jose Luis', '- 10 - R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 885 (R.I. 2009) (citing In re Amber P., 877 A.2d 608, 615-16 (R.I. 2005)). Furthermore, in considering the length of a parent‟s incarceration, “„the trial justice is not required to consider parole eligibility[;] he or she is only required to consider the probable duration of imprisonment at the time of the termination.‟” In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d at 503 (quoting In re Isabella C., 852 A.2d 550, 558 (R.I. 2004)); see also In re Amber P., 877 A.2d at 616. “In calculating the period of incarceration, the [trial] justice may look to the total sentence, even if the parent is eligible for parole.” In re Faith H., 813 A.2d 55, 57 (R.I. 2003).', 'The record clearly reflects that the trial justice did not base his determination solely on respondent-father‟s incarceration. Instead, the trial justice acknowledged respondent-father‟s “great effort” to better himself—noting the classes he had taken as well as his dedication to religion and the study of the Bible—in tandem with respondent-father‟s faithful allegiance to biweekly visits with the child. However, in addition to weighing those factors, the trial justice considered the duration of respondent-father‟s full sentence of twelve years at the ACI with six years to serve and six years suspended. Amiah was born in June 2009, and this case was decided in June 2011. The trial justice observed that respondent-father already had been incarcerated for twelve of his fifty years. Further, the trial justice noted that, if respondent-father served the full sentence, his release would be in 2014, and the earliest possible release date—based on good time—would not occur until sometime in 2012.', 'Moreover, the trial justice recognized that Amiah has lived in foster care since birth and that the child had bonded with her foster mother. Recognizing what he termed respondent- father‟s “great plans,” the trial justice doubted whether those plans would come to fruition. The trial justice opined that, unfortunately, respondent-father was “more concerned with his [own] wants and needs than he is with the wants and needs of this child.” In the end, respondent- father‟s efforts were deemed “too little and much too late.”', '- 11 -', 'We decline to declare this conclusion clearly erroneous. At the time of the Family Court‟s decision in June 2011, there was no reliable indication that respondent-father would be released before his “flat time release” date of 2014, when Amiah would be nearly five years old.10 She would be deprived of the benefit of stability and permanency for a significant portion of her childhood. In light of respondent-father‟s prison sentence, Amiah‟s age and development, and the uncertain and vague plans for the child pending respondent-father‟s release, the trial justice appropriately based his decision on the clear and convincing evidence that respondent- father‟s “imprisonment rendered it improbable for him to care for the child for an extended period of time.” In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d at 885.', 'This Court acknowledges that respondent-father made commendable efforts and expressed sincere love and affection for Amiah and has a desire to be a parent to the child. Nonetheless, he presented no evidence of his actual ability to care for Amiah within a reasonable period. Ultimately, “a parent‟s genuine love for [his] child, or an existence of a bond between parent and child, is not sufficient to overcome the child‟s fundamental right to a safe and nurturing environment.” In re Douglas F., 840 A.2d 1087, 1089 (R.I. 2003); see also In re Brianna D., 798 A.2d 413, 415 (R.I. 2002).', 'The termination of parental rights is a sad event. In re David L., 877 A.2d 667, 673 (R.I. 2005). Although we note respondent-father‟s attempts to improve himself and make plans for his daughter, “once unfitness is established, the primary focus no longer is on the parent, but on the child‟s best interests.” In re Shawn M., 898 A.2d 102, 108 (R.I. 2006). Indeed, “[t]he best interests and welfare of the child outweigh all other considerations.” Id. (citing In re Kristen B., 10', 'We note that respondent-father had been released from the ACI by the time of the hearing of this appeal; but “we review the findings of the trial justice in light of the facts that existed at the time that the Family Court rendered its decision.” In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 885 n.9 (R.I. 2009) (citing In re Tinisha P., 697 A.2d 622, 625 (R.I. 1997)).', '- 12 - 558 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1989)). Every child has a right to reasonable care and maintenance; to be free from abuse or neglect, with the hope of spending the remainder of his or her childhood in a family setting in which the child may grow and thrive. In re Raymond C., 864 A.2d at 634. “Children „are entitled to permanency; they should not have to wait for an indeterminate period of time to find out if their parents will successfully obtain and maintain a substance free lifestyle.‟” In re Shawn M., 898 A.2d at 108 (quoting In re Eric K., 756 A.2d 769, 772-73 (R.I. 2000)).', 'Having upheld the trial justice‟s termination of the respondent-father‟s parental rights under § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i), we need not address the issue of termination based on abandonment.', 'Conclusion', 'There is ample evidence to support the trial justice‟s finding that DCYF proved by clear and convincing evidence that the respondents are unfit parents and that the termination of their parental rights was in Amiah‟s best interests. The decree of the Family Court terminating the parental rights of the respondent-mother is affirmed.

130,v. : Cranston School Department. : Charles Pearson : No. 2011-22-Appeal. (PC 08-4079) v. : Cranston School Department. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. These consolidated cases came before the Supreme Court on September 25, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The plaintiffs, Craig Sacco (Sacco) and Charles Pearson (Pearson) (collectively, plaintiffs), brought suit against the defendant, the Cranston School Department (the school department or defendant), seeking grievance arbitration of adverse actions taken against them as to their respective coaching positions at Cranston West High School (Cranston West or school).1 The plaintiffs, both of whom are teachers at Cranston West, separately filed grievances against the school department in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that was in place between the Cranston Teacher‟s Alliance (alliance) and the school department. The defendant responded that the CBA did not apply to the plaintiffs in their capacity as coaches, and it subsequently refused 1', 'The plaintiffs filed two separate actions that were consolidated in the Superior Court on October 6, 2008, and also were consolidated on appeal by an order of this Court on October 13, 2011.', '-1- to submit to arbitration. The plaintiffs filed suit, seeking a declaratory judgment that they were entitled to binding arbitration, as guaranteed by the CBA. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by the parties.', 'On September 30, 2010, the trial justice determined that the plaintiffs—in their capacity as coaches—were not entitled to avail themselves of the CBA‟s grievance procedures. The trial justice granted the defendant‟s motion for summary judgment in each case and denied the respective motions for summary judgment and declaratory judgment sought by the plaintiffs.', 'These appeals ensued. Having carefully reviewed the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and the appeals may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'It is undisputed that both Sacco and Pearson are teachers at Cranston West; additionally, Sacco was head coach of the school‟s varsity boy‟s hockey team for nine years, and Pearson was head coach of the varsity girl‟s soccer team for seven years. According to school department policy, all coaches undergo annual evaluations at the end of each season by the school department athletic director, Michael Traficante (athletic director or Traficante).', 'In accordance with this policy, Pearson and Sacco were evaluated at the conclusion of the 2007-2008 season. Each received an unfavorable evaluation. As a result, Pearson was placed on probation for one year.2', 'Sacco was removed from his coaching position based on his unsatisfactory evaluation.', 'Both plaintiffs disputed the substance of the charges levied against them in the evaluations and sought to file grievances under Article VI of the CBA, which was effective 2', 'According to Traficante‟s evaluation, Pearson was classified as probationary, “to be recommended for reassignment [to the position] provided an understanding can be reached where improvement is recommended.”', '-2- September 1, 2005 through August 31, 2008. Article VI A.1. details grievance procedures and defines a “grievance” as “a complaint by a teacher or the Alliance (1) that there has been as to him/her or to it, a violation or inequitable application of any of the provisions of this contract or (2) that he/she or it has been treated inequitably * * * contrary to established School Committee policy.”', 'The school department refused to submit to arbitration because it asserted that the coaches were not employed pursuant to the CBA, but instead were working under separate, one- year coaching contracts. The defendant pointed to Resolution No. 05-6-29, a policy that was adopted by the school department on June 20, 2005, as the operative document setting forth the applicable retention standards governing coaching positions. Resolution No. 05-6-29 establishes that all coaching vacancies must be posted in each building by the superintendent, and that in the absence of qualified candidates within the particular school, the positions will be advertised. The resolution further prescribes the annual evaluation process and specifies that a coach must receive an adequate or better rating on a majority of the five categories evaluated to be reappointed.3', 'Sacco and Pearson both failed to attain adequate ratings in more than two categories.', 'The plaintiffs, however, maintained that, notwithstanding Resolution No. 05-6-29, the policies articulated in the CBA also apply, and define the rights of teachers who are functioning in coaching positions. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief to challenge the actions of the 3', 'The evaluation form used by the school department allows the athletic director to score a coach‟s performance in the five areas of administration, knowledge of the sport, personal qualities, performance, and self improvement. In each category, and in various sub-categories, a coach‟s performance may be rated as distinguished, adequate, probationary, unsatisfactory, or not applicable. The evaluation also allows space for general commentary by the athletic director.', '-3- school department concerning the arbitration procedures outlined in the CBA.4 In granting summary judgment to defendants the trial justice determined that “the teachers here who function as coaches are not performing professional services within the contemplation of the collective bargaining agreement when they are functioning as coaches.” In so doing, the trial justice relied on Harbor Creek School District v. Harbor Creek Education Association, 640 A.2d 899, 902 (Pa. 1994), as persuasive authority for the proposition that extracurricular work that traditionally is performed by teachers is not professional in nature and, consequently, is not arbitrable under the CBA.5 The plaintiffs urge this Court to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court and to hold that Sacco and Pearson, in their capacity as coaches, may avail themselves of the CBA‟s grievance procedures. We decline to do so.', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that this Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Moore v. Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, 18 A.3d 541, 544 (R.I. 2011) (citing Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009)). “We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and „if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[,]‟ we will affirm the judgment.” Id. (quoting Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010)). 4', 'In their Rule 12A statements, plaintiffs also argue that the school department‟s actions toward Sacco and Pearson were inequitable because plaintiffs were removed from their coaching positions in violation of Resolution No. 05-6-29. We note that the only question before this Court is whether plaintiffs were entitled to submit their grievances to arbitration in accordance with the CBA. We need not pass upon the separate question of whether the school department complied with Resolution No. 05-6-29, nor do we speculate about what remedy, if any, was available to plaintiffs arising from any purported contract violations. That issue is not before us. 5', 'The trial justice also determined that there was insufficient evidence of past practice by the school department of submitting issues involving coaches to the grievance procedures described in the CBA. The plaintiffs did not challenge that finding.', '-4-', '“Whether a particular collective bargaining agreement contains clear language creating a duty to arbitrate a particular dispute is a matter for judicial determination.” School Committee of North Kingstown v. Crouch, 808 A.2d 1074, 1078 (R.I. 2002) (citing Local Union 1393 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO v. Utilities District of Western Indiana Rural Electric Membership Cooperative, 167 F.3d 1181, 1183 (7th Cir. 1999)). “Because arbitrability is a question of law, we review such determinations de novo.” Crouch, 808 A.2d at 1078.', 'Analysis', '“[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.” Crouch, 808 A.2d at 1078 (quoting AT & T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, 475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986)). This Court has held that “[n]o one is under a duty to arbitrate unless with clear language he [or she] has agreed to do so.” Id. (quoting Stanley-Bostitch, Inc. v. Regenerative Environmental Equipment Co., 697 A.2d 323, 326 (R.I. 1997)). In the absence of clear language in the CBA providing that plaintiffs—in their capacities as coaches—have a right to submit grievances to the arbitration and grievance procedures, no such right will be read into the contract. Therefore, it is our task to look to the CBA and the rights enunciated in it to determine whether there is an express agreement to arbitrate the rights of teachers who are working as sports-team coaches.', 'Article VI of the CBA sets forth the provisions concerning grievance resolution procedures.', 'Article VI A.1. defines “grievance” and specifies that the term encapsulates complaints made by “a teacher or the Alliance.” Because the alliance is not a party to this suit, plaintiffs may avail themselves of Article VI only in their professional capacity as teachers. Article II of the CBA defines the term “teacher” as inclusive of “certified classroom teachers,', '-5- teachers of the homebound, librarians, nurses, guidance counselors, reading consultants, department chairpersons, social workers and 10 month psychologists * * * excluding per diem teachers.”', 'Importantly, while nurses, guidance counselors, and librarians are among those employees classified in the CBA as teachers, coaches are not.', 'We deem the omission determinative. It is our opinion that if the school district or the union intended for coaches to enjoy the rights of teachers in their professional capacities, it would have included the term in the definitional section.', 'Additionally, our review of Resolution No. 05-6-29 discloses that although coaching vacancies initially are made available to those teachers assigned to a particular school, a coach may be hired from outside the school system and need not be a teacher nor a member of the collective bargaining unit. It follows that although some coaches also may be teachers, there is no concomitant requirement that a coach also hold a teaching position.', 'Furthermore, the CBA specifically refers to extracurricular positions in only two places. Article XXIV sets forth various considerations that primarily apply to the hiring of teachers for extracurricular roles. Article XXIV E. provides that when extracurricular position vacancies are filled, the applicant with the greatest seniority as a teacher shall be given preference, provided that the applicant is as equally qualified as are the remaining applicants. Additionally, Appendix D to the CBA sets forth a salary supplement scale for teachers who hold extracurricular positions. Nowhere in Article XXIV or Appendix D does the CBA grant to those who hold extracurricular positions the same panoply of benefits and protections that the CBA affords to teachers. Because neither hiring nor compensation for extracurricular jobs is at issue here, Article XXIV and Appendix D are not relevant to our analysis.', 'Article VI of the CBA sets forth the grievance procedures available to teachers who wish to pursue a complaint; however, those provisions do not refer to, encompass, or otherwise', '-6- incorporate the CBA provisions in Article XXIV and Appendix D about teachers who hold extracurricular positions. Thus, we cannot “clearly and unambiguously” discern any provision in the CBA specifying that coaches are entitled to the grievance procedures afforded to teachers by Article VI of the CBA. Crouch, 808 A.2d at 1079 (holding that none of the CBA provisions “clearly and unambiguously provided for the arbitration of disputes relating to the dismissal of a tenured teacher for cause”).', 'The question of whether teachers who work in extracurricular coaching capacities are beneficiaries of the grievance protections of the CBA is an issue of first impression in this state. A survey of our sister states reveals numerous opinions that hold that coaches who hold teaching positions do not enjoy the benefits and rights associated with their employment as teachers when acting in a coaching capacity, and may not arbitrate disputes concerning their extracurricular positions under a CBA.6 As aptly articulated in the opinion of our sister state as quoted by the trial justice, “extracurricular work performed by teachers * * * is work of a non-professional nature performed under agreements that are merely supplemental to the [CBA].” Harbor Creek School District, 640 A.2d at 902. 6', 'See, e.g., Smith v. Board of Education of Urbana School District No. 116 of Champaign County, Illinois, 708 F.2d 258, 261 (7th Cir. 1983) (holding that teachers who were also school athletic coaches were not, in their coaching capacity, entitled to the tenure protections afforded teachers under Illinois state law); see also Brayton v. Monson Public Schools, 950 F. Supp. 33, 37 (D. Mass. 1997) (determining that due process rights were not violated when the school fired the plaintiff, because he had no expectation of continued employment in his extracurricular soccer coach position, and his termination as a coach did not affect his teaching position); Matter of Board of Education of Port Jefferson Union Free School District v. Port Jefferson Teachers‟ Association, 663 N.Y.S.2d 69, 70 (N.Y. App. Div. 1997) (finding that nowhere in the CBA was there express language requiring arbitration of the board of education‟s decision to deny a teacher a coaching position); Franklin County Board of Education v. Crabtree, 337 S.W.3d 808, 813 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2010) (holding that a grievance resulting from the board of education‟s decision not to rehire a teacher to her coaching position was not subject to the collective bargaining process). But see Matter of Riverhead Central School District v. Riverhead Central Faculty Association, 528 N.Y.S.2d 611, 612 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988) (determining that a negative evaluation of a physical education teacher‟s performance as a varsity football coach was subject to arbitration under a CBA).', '-7-', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice was correct in determining that the plaintiffs‟ coaching positions were contractually distinct from their teaching positions and did not constitute professional employment. Regardless of the advantage in hiring afforded to teachers applying for coaching positions by Article XXIV E., teacher and non-teacher coaches alike ultimately enter into two separate, one-year contracts, governed by Resolution No. 05-6-29. Neither the coaches‟ contracts nor Resolution No. 05-6-29 grant grievance rights to those coaches who are teachers. Consequently, the plaintiffs in their coaching capacities have no right to pursue relief based on the rights bargained for by the alliance on behalf of its teacher-members and as contained in the CBA.7', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court. 7', 'We pause to note that our holding avoids the incongruous result of having a coaching staff at Cranston West in which some coaches—who also happen to be teachers—would enjoy greater rights than coaches who are not teachers because the former may submit their grievances to arbitration while the latter may not, despite the fact that everyone is a party to the same one-year contracts.', '-8-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Craig Sacco v.
