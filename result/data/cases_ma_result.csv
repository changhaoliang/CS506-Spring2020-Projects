In 2000, we affirmed the defendant's convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial.  Commonwealth v. Ellis,"", "", 765 (2000).  In 2013, the defendant filed a second motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence regarding the victim's participation in crimes of police corruption with several Boston police detectives who investigated his murder, and information provided to the police regarding possible third-party culprits.  A Superior Court judge  allowed the new trial motion, concluding that the newly discovered evidence cast real doubt on the justice of his convictions.  We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in ordering a new trial."", ""Background.  1.  Evidence at trial.  The convictions at issue in this case arose from the defendant's third trial.  At the first trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of the illegal possession of two firearms without a license, but were unable to render verdicts on the murder and armed robbery indictments, and a mistrial was declared as to those indictments.  The jury in the second trial were also unable to render verdicts on the murder and armed robbery indictments, resulting again in a mistrial.  We recount the evidence presented at the defendant's third trial."", 'The victim had been a Boston police detective for seventeen years before his death.  In the early morning of September 26, 1993, he was working a paid security detail at a Walgreens pharmacy in the Roslindale section of Boston, a detail that he worked several times a week.', 'The defendant, after waiving the Miranda rights, told police that, at approximately 2:30 A.M., his cousin asked him to buy some diapers on his way home.  His friend, Terry Patterson, drove him and a woman to the Walgreens, where he purchased the diapers.', ""He had earlier received a page from a friend, whom he telephoned from a public pay telephone outside the store at about 3:00 A.M.  According to the defendant, Patterson then drove the defendant and the woman to the defendant's apartment, where he spent the rest of the early morning."", ""At approximately 3:05 A.M., Rosa Sanchez arrived at the Walgreens with her husband to buy soap.  As she walked past the victim's"", 'Page 461', ""vehicle, she noticed that the victim was asleep in his vehicle.  She also saw a man, whom she later identified as the defendant, crouching by the victim's vehicle.  She entered the Walgreens and remained in the store for about twenty minutes."", 'Patterson owned a maroon or burgundy Volkswagen Rabbit vehicle with tinted windows, custom wheels, and a ""bra"" on the front.  At approximately 3:20 A.M., a newspaper deliverer was nearly struck by a vehicle matching that description as it was driven away from the Walgreens with two men in the front seat and a woman in the rear seat.  At about that same time, Victor Brown was awakened by a loud vehicle, and saw two African-American men, one tall, the other short and stocky,', ""standing near a brown Volkswagen Rabbit parked on the sidewalk with a woman sleeping in the rear seat.  The two men walked into a wooded area, reemerged from the woods, and walked down a footpath in the direction of the Walgreens, which was five minutes away on foot.  At approximately 3:35 A.M., Brown heard vehicle doors close and a vehicle engine start, and saw the brown vehicle drive away.\tAs Sanchez left the Walgreens at approximately 3:25 A.M., she saw the man she previously had seen crouching by the victim's vehicle standing with another man by a pay telephone near the vehicle.  At about this same time, another customer arrived at the Walgreens.  She spent a few minutes in the store, and, as she left, she saw two men fitting the descriptions of the defendant and Patterson walking toward the pay telephones.  She noticed as she was entering and leaving the store that the victim appeared to be asleep in his vehicle with his seat reclined."", ""At 3:30 A.M., a Walgreens employee left the store during a break to get coffee, noticing as he left that the victim was in the victim's vehicle and appeared to be fine.  The employee drove to get coffee at a shop that was about five minutes away.  When he returned to the Walgreens several minutes later, he saw that the victim, who was still in the driver's seat of the vehicle with his seat reclined, had blood on his face.  After unsuccessfully trying to rouse the victim, the employee ran into the store and told the manager to call the police.  The 911 call was made at 3:49 A.M."", ""The victim had been shot five times in the face; each of the shots would have proved fatal.  The front driver's side door of the victim's car was unlocked; the front passenger's side door was locked.  The police officers who responded to the scene saw that"", 'Page 462', 'the victim was wearing a holster for his service weapon, but the weapon was missing.  Several of the individuals who were at the Walgreens that morning gave statements to police.  Several witnesses recounted seeing two males whose descriptions were consistent with the defendant and Patterson in the area of the Walgreens between 3:00 and 3:30 A.M., but Sanchez was the only witness who later identified either the defendant or Patterson.', ""Early in the morning of September 30, police located Patterson's vehicle.  The vehicle no longer had a license plate, and the windows were no longer tinted; instead, they bore scratch marks and a glue-like residue, consistent with the tinting having been removed."", ""Under a grant of immunity, Letia Walker, the defendant's girl friend, testified that on the morning of September 30, she went with the defendant to his apartment."", 'The defendant entered the apartment, and returned with a bag.  When they went to Walker\'s home, the defendant removed two guns from the bag, a nine-millimeter Glock pistol and a .25 caliber pistol with a ""white"" handle.  The defendant then hid the guns under Walker\'s dresser.  On October 1, Kurt Headen, a friend of the defendant, came to Walker\'s home.  Walker and Headen removed the guns from under the dresser, and Walker touched the clip of the .25 caliber pistol.  Headen took the guns and discarded them in a field by Walker\'s house.', 'On October 7, Boston police recruits found the two guns in that field.  The Glock recovered from the field was the service weapon registered to the victim.  Forensic testing revealed that the .25 caliber pistol was the murder weapon.', ""On the evening of October 5, Sanchez was brought to the Boston police homicide unit with her husband by Detectives Walter Robinson and Kenneth Acerra to view photographic arrays.  Detective Acerra knew Sanchez personally - he lived with, and had a child by, Sanchez's aunt, and he was a good friend of Sanchez's mother.  Sanchez was shown two photographic arrays, one that contained a photograph of the defendant and another that contained a photograph of Patterson.  When she was first shown the array containing the defendant's photograph, Sanchez became upset and told the police that one of the people in the array had"", 'Page 463', 'stalked her.', 'The detectives who administered the array covered that photograph, and Sanchez looked at the remaining seven photographs.  She pointed to the photograph of someone other than the defendant, stating that she ""[thought] that may be the person"" she saw crouching by the victim\'s vehicle.', ""She left the police station with her husband and Detectives Robinson and Acerra.  Sanchez returned to the homicide unit minutes later, however, after she told her husband that she had intentionally selected the wrong person and her husband related that information to Detective Robinson.  Sanchez testified that she picked the wrong person because she was afraid and did not want to get involved.  When she returned to the homicide unit, she was shown the same photographic array and identified the photograph of the defendant as the person she had seen crouching by the victim's vehicle."", 'Sanchez later identified the defendant in an in-person lineup and made an in-court identification of the defendant.', ""A forensic fingerprint examiner testified to his opinion that a fingerprint, found on the clip of the murder weapon, was made by Walker.  The same fingerprint examiner processed the victim's vehicle and found four latent prints on the driver's side door.  The examiner testified that the four fingerprints were left simultaneously by different fingers of the same hand.  The examiner identified the four fingerprints as belonging to Patterson and opined that the fingerprints were left by the act of closing the vehicle's door."", '', 'Page 464', 'The Commonwealth\'s theory of the case, as presented in closing argument, was that the defendant spotted the victim sleeping in his vehicle and saw the opportunity to steal a police officer\'s service weapon.  The defendant and Patterson, it was argued, then drove to the side street near the Walgreens and left Patterson\'s vehicle there to avoid detection and facilitate their escape.  They then walked back to the Walgreens and waited in the parking lot until no witnesses were present.  When the parking lot was otherwise empty, ""they"" shot the victim, took his service weapon, ran back to Patterson\'s car, and drove away.  Under the Commonwealth\'s theory, the motive for the murder was to take the victim\'s service weapon as a trophy.', 'The jury convicted the defendant of armed robbery and of murder in the first degree on theories of extreme atrocity or cruelty and felony-murder.  The judge denied the defendant\'s motion for a new trial, and on appeal we affirmed both the convictions and the denial of the motion for a new trial.  Ellis, 432 Mass. at 747.  In that motion for a new trial, the defendant argued that newly discovered evidence concerning corrupt police practices committed by Detectives Robinson, Acerra, and Brazil ""cast enough doubt on the integrity of the police investigatory procedures leading up to the Sanchez identification to necessitate a new trial and a new hearing on his motion to suppress.""  Id. at 764.  We noted that in 1997, two years after the defendant\'s convictions at his third trial, a Federal grand jury returned indictments against Acerra and Robinson alleging, among other things, that they submitted false search warrant applications and affidavits and illegally seized property and funds obtained through the searches conducted pursuant to those warrants.  Id.  Acerra and Robinson pleaded guilty to fourteen counts of criminal conduct; Brazil was not charged with criminal wrongdoing but, after being granted immunity, admitted his involvement in the wrongdoing.  Id. at 764 & n.12.  We also noted that Acerra, Robinson, and Brazil ""were each directly involved in the investigation and prosecution of the defendant.""  Id. at 764-765.  Brazil testified at trial ""to the circumstances', 'Page 465', 'and content of the defendant\'s statement to the police.""  Id. at 765.  Acerra and Robinson did not testify at trial, but both testified at the hearing where the defendant\'s motion to suppress the identification of the defendant by Sanchez was denied.  Id.  The defendant argued that ""evidence of [the detectives\'] misconduct in other investigations should be admissible (1) to impeach their credibility concerning the photographic array, and (2) to suggest that Sanchez\'s identification of the defendant\'s photograph was the product of corrupt police tactics, and that a new trial is required for this purpose.""  Id.  We concluded that the defendant had failed to meet his burden of showing that Sanchez\'s identification was ""unnecessarily suggestive"" and therefore should have been suppressed, because there was an ""absence of evidence, by affidavit or otherwise, suggesting that the subject detectives procured false evidence in connection with the investigation of this defendant.""  Id.', ""2.  Second motion for a new trial.  On March 13, 2013, the defendant filed a second motion for a new trial, arguing that he was entitled to a new trial because of newly discovered evidence and the Commonwealth's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.  In support of his motion, the defendant offered documentary evidence obtained through public records requests.  The judge assigned to hear the motion, who was not the trial judge,"", ""allowed the defendant's request for further discovery, which resulted in additional documentary evidence on which the defendant relies.  In addition to considering the documentary evidence, the motion judge held an evidentiary hearing over the course of seven days.  The testimony focused on three issues:  the alleged inadequacies in the investigation, the involvement of corrupt detectives in the investigation, and the discovery that was provided to the defendant's trial counsel."", ""In her decision allowing the motion for a new trial, the judge identified various categories of evidence that she concluded were newly discovered:  (1) information regarding the theft on September 9, 1993, seventeen days before the victim's death, of approximately $26,000 from Robert Martin by Detectives Robinson, Acerra, and Kenneth Beers, Sergeant Detective Leonard J. Marquardt, and the victim (Martin theft); (2) Federal Bureau of Investigation informant reports (FBI informant reports); (3) information regarding an allegation by Boston police Detective George"", 'Page 466', 'Foley that the son of a Boston police officer had told him in late August, 1993, that his father was going to kill the victim because the victim would not leave the son\'s fourteen year old sister alone (Foley allegation); (4) information from Boston police anti-corruption division (ACD) files regarding Detective Robinson and the victim together robbing two mid-level drug dealers of a large sum of money in or around May of 1992 (drug dealer robbery); (5) information from ACD files regarding the victim obtained through Ronald Hansen (Hansen report); and (6) tips from the Boston police ""hotline"" established after the victim\'s killing to obtain investigative leads (hotline tips).  We briefly summarize the most relevant information in the judge\'s findings regarding each of these categories of evidence.', 'a.  Martin theft.  As described in the Federal grand jury testimony of Martin and his roommate in September and October, 1996, respectively, and an ACD report of Martin\'s interview with an investigator, Martin was stopped on September 9, 1993, by Detectives Robinson, Acerra, and Beers, along with the victim and Sergeant Detective Marquardt, while Martin was in a vehicle conducting a sale of marijuana with another individual.  Acerra identified himself as an ""INS"" officer and gave a false name during the encounter.  The detectives confiscated Martin\'s knapsack, which contained seven pounds of marijuana, and served Martin with a search warrant for his apartment.  Robinson and Acerra took Martin\'s keys and left Martin in the vehicle ""guarded by"" the victim.  Robinson later returned to the vehicle and told Martin to come to the apartment to open a safe, which Martin did.  The safe contained twenty-two pounds of marijuana.  The victim appears to have entered the apartment either with Martin or after Martin left the vehicle.', ""Martin's roommate arrived at the apartment to find Martin, Martin's girl friend, and another friend of Martin being detained by the detectives.  Two detectives took the roommate to his room and asked him to open a safe, from which they confiscated marijuana.  Robinson then took Martin to a second apartment with Acerra and Marquardt to open another safe, leaving the victim and Beers in the first apartment to detain Martin's roommate and the others.  When the detectives asked Martin to open the safe in the second apartment, Martin asked Marquardt whether, in exchange, the detectives would release Martin's friends.  Marquardt told him he would release them only if there was more money in the safe,"", 'Page 467', 'because they had found only $8,000.', 'When Martin opened the safe, Acerra removed approximately $18,000 to $20,000.  After a telephone call from one of the detectives at the second apartment, the roommate and the others were released.  The police report documenting the execution of the warrant, which was signed by both Detective Robinson and the victim, declares that ""several pounds of marijuana"" and drug paraphernalia were seized; the report makes no reference to the seizure of any money.', '', 'b.  FBI informant reports.  An FBI informant who had ""an intimate knowledge"" of the victim reported on November 12, 1993, that the victim ""regularly . . . \'shook down\' pimps, prostitutes, and drug dealers for money.""  The victim, according to this informant, also dealt drugs, extorted other police officers, and ""used every means available to blackmail people.""  The informant ""has heard often that [the victim] committed murder as a cop.""', 'An FBI informant reported on November 1, 1993, that Detective Foley was recently disciplined for accusing Officer Raymond Armstead, Sr. (Armstead Sr.) of involvement in the victim\'s murder.  The reports also contain allegations that the victim was a ""rogue"" officer who ""[shook] down"" bar owners, bookmakers, and the owners of second-hand jewelry stores, and paid a prostitute to drop charges against a third party.  The reports also reveal that the victim ""\'liked\' young black girls"" and was the subject of a Federal investigation as early as 1986.', 'c.  Foley allegation.  Detective Foley was originally assigned to the Boston police task force that was constituted in the wake of the victim\'s death to investigate his murder (task force).  On September 30, 1993, Detective Foley related to several detectives that, in August of that year, he was investigating threats made against Raymond Armstead, Jr. (Armstead Jr.), a correction officer for the Suffolk County sheriff\'s department and son of Armstead Sr.  Detective Foley reported that Armstead Jr. told Foley that his father had a ""beef"" with the victim because the victim would not ""leave [Armstead Jr.\'s] fourteen year old sister alone.""  Foley stated that Armstead Jr. told Foley that his father was going to kill the victim and that his father knew that the victim worked a detail at Walgreens and slept in his vehicle during the detail.  Foley said', 'Page 468', 'that Armstead Jr. told him that Foley would ""read about it in the papers"" that the victim had been ""[s]hot between the eyes at Walgreens.""', ""A report authored by Sergeant Detective Daniel Keeler stated that, later in the day on September 30, Keeler and Sergeant Detective Thomas J. O'Leary met with Armstead Jr. to discuss the allegations.  During this interview, Armstead Jr. confirmed that Foley had investigated the threats against Armstead Jr. but denied telling Foley that his father was going to kill the victim, denied knowing the victim, and denied that the victim had any involvement with a younger sister, stating that he was the youngest child in his family."", '', 'Confronted with the information elicited from Armstead Jr.,  Foley said that he may have been ""totally wrong,"" but ultimately insisted that he was telling the truth.  At 11:30 P.M. on September 30, Captain Detective Edward J. McNelley told Foley that the information he had supplied was false.  McNelley concluded that Foley was suffering from ""severe emotional depression"" and was unable to perform his duties, so he requested that Foley surrender his gun and badge, and relieved him of duty.   Foley later received treatment at a hospital.  A psychological evaluation concluded that Foley could return to work and carry a gun.', 'd.  Drug dealer robbery.  An ACD report dated November 17, 1993, reported that an anonymous tipster had reported that, eighteen months earlier, the victim and Robinson had robbed two drug dealers at gunpoint.  The reliability of the tip was rated ""good,"" and an ACD lieutenant met with the tipster that day and learned that the robbery involved a large sum of money.', 'e.  Hansen report.  The ACD files contained notes from an interview with Ronald Hansen, dated May 9, 1996.  Detective Robinson used Hansen and Hansen\'s ex-wife as informants.  The interview notes recount that the ex-wife had known the victim since she was sixteen years old and that the victim ""used to take young girls for rides in his car.""  The notes also state that Detective Robinson asked Hansen if he knew anything about the victim\'s murder and Hansen responded that the victim ""took drugs from the girl friend of one of the killers and told her if her boy friend wanted the drugs', 'Page 469', 'back he would have to come and see [the victim] or he\'d arrest her.""  Hansen added that ""[o]ne of the girls killed in Mattapan was the girl friend,"" apparently referring to one of the defendant\'s cousins who was killed on September 29, 1993.  See note 4, supra.  The notes also reflect that another detective asked the ex-wife if the victim carried a .25 caliber gun on his ankle, and she answered that the victim did.', ""f.  Hotline tips.  The same day as the victim's shooting, the Boston police department publicized a hotline for people to call with tips regarding the victim's murder.  While the motion for a new trial was being litigated, the defendant requested and the Commonwealth disclosed written reports of the tips received on the hotline, some of which the defendant had received in redacted form from a prior public records request."", 'Many of the tips allege or suggest that someone other than the defendant committed the murder or participated in the murder.  The notes memorializing the tips show, among other things, that (1) on the afternoon of September 26, 1993, a detective ""called and stated that his brother . . . , who is a guard at South Bay . . . told him that an inmate, William Bell, told [his brother] that a drug dealer, named Armstead, had a contract out on [the victim]""; (2) a tip dated September 30, was purportedly from a taxicab driver who drove the victim\'s girl friend to the parking lot the night of the murder where she shot him with a .25 caliber gun that the victim had given her for self-defense;', ',', '(3) police received two separate tips, one on September 27, 1993, and another on September 29, alleging that a ""Royce Hill"" was an accomplice to the shooting; and (4) police received three separate tips stating that someone at the Essex County house of correction had information relating to the victim\'s murder.', 'At the evidentiary hearing on the second motion for a new trial, Sergeant Detective O\'Leary testified that he was the ""shepherd"" of the victim\'s homicide investigation, and that, as tips came in, ""they were handed out"" to pairs of investigators who were part of the task force engaged in the homicide investigation.  O\'Leary', 'Page 470', ""stated that he would write the names of the detectives he assigned to investigate the tip on the report of the tip and that those detectives should have documented any investigation that was done to follow up on the tip in a report that was filed with him.  He admitted, however, that there was only one tip that showed that detectives had been assigned to investigate it, and that the tip had been assigned to Sergeant Detective Marquardt and Detective Acerra.  O'Leary further conceded that there are no reports or records showing that any investigation was done to follow up on any of the tips received on the hotline."", 'The judge concluded that these six categories of newly discovered evidence showed that the investigators ""failed to vigorously pursue other leads"" and, when combined with evidence of the ""conflict of interest"" of Acerra, Robinson, and Brazil,  formed the basis for ""a potentially powerful"" defense under Commonwealth v. Bowden,', ', 485-486 (1980).', 'The judge found that Robinson, Acerra, and Brazil ""were involved in nearly every aspect of the homicide investigation"" that resulted in the defendant\'s prosecution.  All three were on the fifty-person task force conducting the investigation.  Acerra and Marquardt were among the first to enter the victim\'s home after he was killed.', ""Acerra and Brazil were the first to respond to Sanchez's home on the day of the killing.  Acerra and Robinson were present when Sanchez was first shown the photographic array and were with Sanchez after she selected the photograph of someone other than the defendant and before she identified the defendant.  Acerra and Detective Richard Ross found the victim's cellular telephone below a tray in the center console of the victim's vehicle on October 1, even though an inventory search of the vehicle had been conducted on the day of the shooting and a cellular telephone was not among the twenty-two items listed in the inventory."", 'Acerra and Robinson drove Headen, who allegedly hid the firearms in the field, to', 'Page 471', 'the police station to be interviewed on October 12, 1993.', ""Brazil was one of the detectives who questioned the defendant, and he was one of the detectives who interviewed the defendant's uncle."", '', 'The conflict of interest the judge identified was that', '""Detectives Brazil, Acerra, and Robinson had a personal interest in solving [the victim\'s] homicide as quickly as possible before any members of the . . . [t]ask [f]orce, who were not part of the corruption scheme, or anyone else, could look further into', '[the victim] may have rubbed people the wrong way or was rumored to be a \'dirty cop.\'  In other words, they needed to prevent others from finding out that they and [the victim] had been engaging in illegal activities.""  (Emphasis in original.)', 'The judge stated that, with this newly discovered evidence, the defendant could have argued that the corrupt detectives ""compromised potential evidence of the identity of [the victim\'s] killer while attempting to conceal evidence of their own wrongdoing.""', 'The judge also found that', '""[t]he newly discovered evidence would have further supported a powerful Bowden defense by revealing that the Commonwealth failed to investigate numerous other parties with reason to kill [the victim].  Such a defense could have raised a reasonable doubt as to whether, as the Commonwealth claimed at trial, [the defendant] decided to kill [the victim] simply because the opportunity presented itself.""', 'Page 472', 'The judge concluded that the newly discovered evidence of the conflict of interest of Acerra, Robinson, and Brazil, and the Boston police department\'s ""failure to follow up on leads implicating third-party suspects is material, credible, and would have been a real factor in the jury\'s deliberations,"" such that ""this is a case where justice has not been done.""', '', ""Discussion.  The Commonwealth essentially makes three challenges to the motion judge's new trial order.  First, the Commonwealth contends that the judge was clearly erroneous in finding that the Foley allegation and the hotline tips were newly discovered.  Second, the Commonwealth claims that, in considering the first motion for a new trial, the motion judge and this court knew of the evidence of police corruption committed by Detectives Acerra, Robinson, and Brazil and the defendant therefore is barred by the principle of direct estoppel from relitigating this issue in a second motion for a new trial.  Third, the Commonwealth argues that the motion judge abused her discretion in ordering a new trial.  We address each of these three arguments."", '1.  Newly discovered evidence.  Evidence is newly discovered if it ""was unknown to the defendant or trial counsel and not reasonably discoverable at the time of trial"" or at an earlier motion for a new trial.  Commonwealth v. Cowels,', ', 616 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Shuman,', ', 271 (2005).  See Commonwealth v. Grace,', "", 306 (1986).  The Commonwealth claims that the judge's finding that the Foley allegation and the hotline tips were newly discovered was clearly erroneous because it had disclosed this information to defense counsel before the third trial."", ""The Commonwealth points to the testimony at the evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial presented by the lead prosecutor on the case, Assistant District Attorney Phyllis Broker (the prosecutor).  Sergeant Detective O'Leary testified that he had numbered and indexed all the police"", 'Page 473', 'reports filed in the investigation, and numbered and indexed the hotline tips into two indices:  one of tips about the murder generally and another of tips regarding the Volkswagen that eventually became a focus of the investigation.  He further testified that he had turned over all of the numbered and indexed reports to the prosecutor.', 'The prosecutor testified that she had no memory of her disclosure of specific items of discovery in the defendant\'s case but recalled that her routine practice regarding discovery was to disclose ""everything"" unless there was a reason not to, in which case she would ""have a hearing on it.""  In producing discovery to defense counsel, she would number the police reports as they came in, make copies, and then write a discovery letter enclosing the reports and referencing them by number.', ""As to the Foley allegation, the prosecutor testified from her review of the Commonwealth's files that a copy of Detective Keeler's report regarding Detective Foley's allegations was numbered 186, that this number was circled, and that there is a corresponding entry referencing the Keeler report in an index of police reports that she created.  She testified that this was consistent with her routine practice and indicative that she turned over the report to defense counsel."", '', 'As to the hotline tips, the Commonwealth points to two indices of the hotline tips in the Commonwealth\'s files that have the handwritten words ""given to counsel"" on the first page.  the prosecutor testified that the handwriting is hers and indicates that she provided the indices, and inferentially the reports of the tips themselves, to defense counsel.', ""The defendant, however, introduced evidence suggesting that the discovery process in his case was not as orderly as it appeared.  The defendant introduced two versions of indices of police reports related to the investigation, which contain the same documents numbered somewhat differently.  The defendant also introduced several transmittal letters that enclosed discovery sent by the prosecutor to the defendant's trial counsel.  These discovery letters"", 'Page 474', ""showed that some documents that were disclosed to the defense were not referenced by number, that those documents that were referred to by number were not disclosed sequentially -- one letter enclosed seven documents including one document numbered 138 and one document numbered 197 -- and that at least one of the documents referred to by number in a discovery letter did not correspond to the prosecutor's numbered index, which she claims listed all of the documents disclosed to the defense."", ""Attorneys David Duncan and Norman Zalkind, the defendant's trial attorneys, testified that they did not receive any report of the Foley allegation or any hotline tips alleging that third parties were involved in the victim's murder.  In addition to having no recollection of receiving those materials, trial counsel testified that, if they had received them, they either would have sent an investigator to follow up on the allegations or would have filed discovery motions seeking additional information from the Commonwealth, but they did neither in this case.  The defendant also introduced evidence showing that, when the defendant's trial counsel received a letter from then State Senator Diane Wilkerson stating that she had received a telephone call from a person claiming to have information about the victim's murder and attaching her notes of the call, they filed a discovery motion that sought information from the Commonwealth regarding those allegations."", ""We conclude that the judge's finding that the Foley allegation and the hotline tips were newly discovered was not clearly erroneous.  The judge was entitled to credit the testimony of the defendant's trial counsel that they did not receive this information and that, if they had, they surely would have followed up on it through additional investigation or requests for further discovery.  In addition, where there was evidence of irregularities in the discovery process, the judge also was not obliged to find that these documents had been furnished in discovery based on the numbering and indexing of investigative documents and on the prosecutor's description of her routine discovery practices."", ""2.  Direct estoppel.  The Commonwealth contends that the newly discovered evidence adds nothing material to what was presented to the judge in the first motion for a new trial and, on appeal, to this court when we affirmed the defendant's convictions and the denial of the motion for a new trial after plenary review under G. L. c. 278, § 33E.  It correctly notes that we knew then that Detectives Acerra, Robinson, and Brazil had been implicated in submitting false search warrant applications and affidavits in other"", 'Page 475', 'cases and in illegally seizing property and money while executing those fraudulent warrants, and that Acerra and Robinson had pleaded guilty to Federal indictments arising from those allegations.  Ellis, 432 Mass. at 764.  It also correctly notes that the defendant attached to his first motion for a new trial a Boston Globe article, dated February 18, 1996, reporting that the Boston police ""anticorruption unit"" was investigating Detective Robinson and the victim for their alleged involvement in the robbery of money from two drug dealers in 1991.  Because this information was known to us when we concluded, after reviewing the entire record under § 33E, that we found ""nothing that compels us to exercise our discretion to disturb the jury\'s verdict,"" id. at 765-766, the Commonwealth contends that the motion judge should have denied the defendant\'s motion for a new trial ""based on the principle of direct estoppel,"" and cites Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 709-712 (2005), in support of this argument.  We disagree.', 'In Rodriguez, supra at 710-711, we declared that, where a defendant ""raises no new factual or legal issue"" in a motion under Mass R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in  435 Mass. 1501  (2001), and simply seeks to relitigate a motion that was previously denied by the motion judge and rejected on direct appeal, ""principles of direct estoppel operate as a bar to the defendant\'s attempt in [the] rule 30 (b) motion to relitigate issues.""  For direct estoppel to apply, however, ""the Commonwealth must show that the issues raised in the defendant\'s rule 30 (b) motion were actually litigated and determined on the defendant\'s original motion,"" which here means the defendant\'s first motion for a new trial.  Id. at 710.', 'In affirming the denial of the first motion for a new trial, we recognized that Detectives Acerra, Robinson, and Brazil had engaged in police misconduct in other cases, but we concluded that the defendant had failed to meet his burden of furnishing evidence ""suggesting that the subject detectives procured false evidence in connection with the investigation of this defendant.""  Ellis, 432 Mass at 765.  We did not know at that time that these detectives had been engaged with the victim in criminal acts of police misconduct as recently as seventeen days before the victim\'s murder.', ""The complicity of the victim in the detectives' malfeasance fundamentally changes the significance of the"", 'Page 476', 'detectives\' corruption with respect to their investigation of the victim\'s murder.  Without the victim\'s complicity, the defendant could argue that these detectives had engaged in misconduct with respect to other investigations and therefore might have been more likely to have engaged in misconduct with respect to this investigation.  But with the victim\'s complicity, these detectives would likely fear that a prolonged and comprehensive investigation of the victim\'s murder would uncover leads that might reveal their own criminal corruption.  They, therefore, had a powerful incentive to prevent a prolonged or comprehensive investigation, and to discourage or thwart any investigation of leads that might reveal the victim\'s corrupt acts.  This issue was not ""actually litigated and determined on the defendant\'s original motion,"" see Rodriguez, 443 Mass. at 710-711, and therefore is not barred by direct estoppel.', '3.  Abuse of discretion.  Having determined that the judge did not clearly err in her findings on the newly discovered evidence and that her consideration of the issue is not barred by direct estoppel, we now address whether the judge abused her discretion in concluding that ""justice has not been done"" and ordering a new trial.  See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b) (""The trial judge . . . may grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done"").', '""Whether an appeal is from the granting or the denial of a motion for a new trial, an appellate court will examine the motion judge\'s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.""  Grace, 397 Mass. at 307.  See Commonwealth v. Raymond,', ', 733 (2008).  ""Under the abuse of discretion standard, the issue is whether the judge\'s decision resulted from \'a clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision . . . such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.\'""  Commonwealth v. Kolenovic,', ', 672 (2015), quoting L.L. v. Commonwealth,', ', 185 n.27 (2014).', 'A judge may order a new trial where newly discovered evidence ""casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.""  Cowels, 470 Mass. at 616, quoting Grace, 397 Mass. at 305.  To conclude that the evidence casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction, ""[t]he motion judge decides not whether the verdict would have', 'Page 477', 'been different, but rather whether the new evidence would probably have been a real factor in the jury\'s deliberations.""  Cowels, supra, quoting Grace, supra.  Consequently, the issue before us is whether the judge made a clear error of judgment in determining that the newly discovered evidence ""would probably have been a real factor in the jury\'s deliberations.""  See Cowels, supra.', 'The Commonwealth contends that there is no doubt cast on the justice of the convictions because none of the newly discovered evidence affects the compelling evidence that the defendant was in possession of the murder weapon and the victim\'s service pistol and that he caused the weapons to be discarded in a field in the days following the killing.  The Commonwealth notes that the judge did not vacate the defendant\'s convictions from the first trial of the unlawful possession of these firearms and that the defendant does not challenge these convictions on appeal.  The Commonwealth contends, in essence, that given the defendant\'s possession of these weapons, the newly discovered evidence regarding the victim\'s complicity with the corrupt detectives and the unexplored leads regarding third-party culprits is nothing more than ""a tale . . . , full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""', '', ""We agree that the defendant's possession and concealment of these weapons only days after the killing, combined with the evidence that he was at the Walgreens at or about the time of the killing, is evidence that he was involved in the killing in some fashion.  And, had the defendant been charged with being an accessory after the fact to this murder, this evidence would be more than sufficient to support his conviction of that indictment.  See Commonwealth v. Simpkins,"", ', 462 (2015).  But, as demonstrated in the first trial, where the jury found the defendant guilty of the firearm indictment but were unable to reach a verdict regarding the indictments for murder and armed robbery, his possession and concealment of these firearms does not necessarily mean that he was the shooter or knowingly participated with Patterson in the shooting.  See id. at 461-463.  See also Commonwealth v. Zanetti,', ', 470 (2009) (Appendix).  There are at least two alternative scenarios that a jury would need to reject in order to find the defendant guilty of armed robbery and murder.', 'First, the jury would need to reject the possibility, argued in closing by the defendant, that Patterson alone shot the victim,', 'Page 478', 'without the defendant\'s knowing participation, and then passed the murder weapon and the victim\'s service weapon to the defendant.  The strongest evidence of the defendant\'s knowing participation in the murder was the testimony of Rosa Sanchez, who testified that at approximately 3:05 A.M., which was between thirty and forty-five minutes before the victim\'s shooting, she saw a man she later identified as the defendant ""crouching by"" the victim\'s vehicle in front of the Walgreens where the victim sat sleeping.  No doubt for this reason, much of the defendant\'s closing argument was devoted to challenging the accuracy of her testimony.  Trial counsel noted in closing argument that she had said nothing to the store clerk or her husband about this suspicious behavior at the time of the event; she instead went to look at greeting cards inside Walgreens.  Counsel also noted in closing argument that Acerra, whom Sanchez knew, was with her when she was shown the photographic arrays, that she was told to ""pick out the guy,""', 'and that Acerra was a ""close friend"" of the victim.', '', 'It is not difficult to imagine how different the defendant\'s closing argument would have been had he known then that Acerra not only was a close friend of the victim, but also was complicit with the victim in criminal acts of police corruption, including a theft of thousands of dollars in cash from a marijuana dealer earlier that month.  Defense counsel could have argued that the detectives had a strong motive to shore up the case against the two men in the Volkswagen -- suspects unconnected to the detectives\' involvement with the victim in illegal activities -- by ensuring that they obtained an identification of one of them in an incriminating position shortly before the shooting.  Defense counsel could further have argued that, in addition to motive, Detectives Robinson and Acerra had the opportunity to strengthen the case against the defendant and Patterson by leaning on Sanchez to pick the ""right"" person immediately after she had picked the ""wrong"" person.  Sanchez\'s identification of the defendant was already suspect because she initially had identified someone else -- the same person whom her husband selected -- as the person she saw crouching near the victim\'s vehicle, and because she claimed to be rattled by the photograph of her stalker in the array, but later was unable to identify the photograph of the person she said had', 'Page 479', ""stalked her.  We cannot say with confidence that a reasonable jury would have credited her identification if they had known of the newly discovered evidence regarding the victim's complicity with the corrupt detectives who helped procure the identification."", ""Second, the jury would also need to reject the possibility that someone other than the defendant and Patterson shot the victim, and that the defendant somehow recovered and took possession of the murder weapon and the victim's service weapon after the killing.  This was not an argument presented by the defendant at trial, but as the judge noted, the defense strategy may have changed had the newly discovered evidence been known to the defense.  As the motion judge noted, the newly discovered evidence revealed that many individuals had a motive to kill the victim because of his various misdeeds, that there were investigative leads indicating that others may have been responsible for his murder, and that, apart from the Foley allegation, none of these leads was explored."", 'The newly discovered evidence also would have provided an explanation why these leads were not explored -- that corrupt detectives did not wish any of these leads to uncover evidence that might reveal their own criminal misconduct.', ""Perhaps most important, with this newly discovered evidence, a reasonable jury likely would have had diminished  confidence in the integrity and thoroughness of the police investigation in general.  Not only would this likely have caused them to question the reliability of some of the evidence presented by the prosecution, it also may have elevated in significance certain aspects of the investigation that may otherwise have appeared unimportant.  For instance, how did the police know to ask Tina Erti, the roommate of the victim's girl friend whether the victim possessed a small caliber gun with a pearl handle five days before a small caliber gun with a pearl-colored handle was found that was later determined to be the murder weapon?"", 'Did this suggest that the police had information that the victim had been shot with his own firearm, which would itself suggest the possibility that the victim was killed by someone he knew (or by someone assisted by someone he knew)?', 'The Commonwealth argues that the newly discovered evidence', 'Page 480', 'is limited only to Bowden evidence that impeaches the investigation by the police and that we have previously stated that ""[n]ewly discovered evidence that tends merely to impeach the testimony of a witness does not ordinarily warrant a new trial.""  Commonwealth v. McGee,', ', 150 (2014), quoting Commonwealth v. Simmons,', ', 72 (1994).  We agree that it would be a rare case where newly discovered Bowden evidence alone would warrant a new trial.  But it is a rare case where police detectives investigating the killing of another police detective were complicit with the victim in numerous recent acts of criminal police misconduct and where the integrity of the investigation was potentially compromised by their conflicting interest in ensuring that the investigation of the murder did not uncover their own criminal misdeeds.', 'In discussing the admissibility of Bowden evidence, we have said that', '""the inference that may be drawn from an inadequate police investigation is that the evidence at trial may be inadequate or unreliable because the police failed to conduct the scientific tests or to pursue leads that a reasonable police investigation would have conducted or investigated, and these tests or investigation reasonably may have led to significant evidence of the defendant\'s guilt or innocence.  A jury may find a reasonable doubt if they conclude that the investigation was careless, incomplete, or so focused on the defendant that it ignored leads that may have suggested other culprits.""', 'Commonwealth v. Silva-Santiago,', ', 801 (2009).  Implicit in this description of the potential inferential significance of Bowden evidence is that the investigation, however flawed, was conducted in good faith by honest police officers.  Where, as here, the newly discovered Bowden evidence raises substantial doubts regarding the good faith and honesty of some of the investigating detectives, its potential inferential significance is multiplied many-fold, because a jury reasonably may have had diminished confidence in the integrity and good faith of the investigation and the evidence that arose from it.', ""The determination of whether newly discovered evidence would have been a real factor in the jury's deliberations requires that the new evidence be considered in light of the totality of the evidence presented at trial, and the evidence supporting the defendant's"", 'Page 481', ""knowing participation in the murder and armed robbery in this case was not overwhelming.  There was no eyewitness to the shooting and no physical evidence linking the defendant to the victim's vehicle."", ""Sanchez's identification of the defendant occurred only after she identified another individual from the photographic array.  The motive offered by the Commonwealth -- that the defendant saw a police officer sleeping in his vehicle when he went to Walgreens to purchase diapers and hatched a scheme to kill him and take his service weapon as a trophy -- is not particularly compelling.  Although several witnesses testified to seeing people matching the descriptions of the defendant and Patterson in the Walgreens parking lot and surrounding areas, the significance of that evidence is limited by the defendant's admission early in the investigation that he was at Walgreens that night.  The strongest consciousness of guilt evidence is the alteration of Patterson's vehicle after the shooting, but there is no evidence that the defendant participated in that alteration."", 'When we consider the newly discovered evidence together with the totality of the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the judge did not abuse her discretion in determining that the newly discovered evidence ""would have been a real factor in the jury\'s deliberations"" and that a new trial is required for justice to be done.', ""Conclusion.  The motion judge did not abuse her discretion in ruling that the newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial.  The order allowing the defendant's motion for a new trial as to the indictments of murder and armed robbery is affirmed."", 'So ordered.']"

We summarize the facts as found by the judge at the hearing on the motion to suppress, supplemented by evidence in the record that is uncontroverted and that was implicitly credited by the judge.  Commonwealth v. Melo,', ', 286 (2015).  On December 18, 2011, Boston police Officer Luis Anjos was patrolling the Roxbury section of Boston in a marked police cruiser when, at 9:20 P.M., he received a radio call alerting him to a breaking and entering in progress on Hutchings Street, where the suspects were fleeing the scene. The dispatcher gave several possible paths of flight from Hutchings Street, one toward Seaver Street and the other toward Jackson Square, locations that are in the opposite direction from one another.', '', 'Anjos went to the scene and spoke to the victims, a teenage male and his foster mother.  The male reported that as he was leaving the bathroom in the residence, his foster mother said that she heard people in his bedroom.  The victim opened his bedroom door and saw a black male wearing a ""red hoodie"" (hooded sweatshirt) jump out of the window.  When the victim looked out', 'Page 532', 'the window he saw two other black males, one wearing a ""black hoodie,"" and the other wearing ""dark clothing.""  When the victim checked his belongings, he noticed that his backpack, a computer, and five baseball hats were missing.  The victim saw the three males run down Hutchings Street, but he could only guess which direction they took thereafter.  Anjos peered out the window but could only see twelve to fifteen yards up the street to the intersection of Hutchings and Harold Streets.  After speaking to the victims for approximately eight to twelve minutes, Anjos left the scene and broadcast the descriptions of the suspects.', 'For the next fifteen minutes or so, Anjos drove a four to five block radius around the house, searching for persons fitting the suspects\' descriptions.  Because of the cold temperature that night, Anjos did not come across any pedestrians as he searched the area.  At around 9:40 P.M., Anjos headed back toward the police station.  While on Martin Luther King Boulevard, he saw two black males, both wearing dark clothing, walking by some basketball courts near a park.  One male wore a dark-colored ""hoodie.""  Neither of the two carried a backpack.  Anjos did not recognize either of the males, one of whom was the defendant, as a person he had encountered previously in the course of his duties as a police officer.', 'When Anjos spotted the defendant and his companion, he had a hunch that they might have been involved in the breaking and entering.  He based his hunch on the time of night, the proximity to the breaking and entering, and the fit of the males to the ""general description"" provided by the victim.  He decided ""to figure out who they were and where they were coming from and possibly do [a field interrogation observation (FIO)].""', 'He rolled down the passenger\'s side window of the cruiser and ""yelled out,"" ""Hey guys, wait a minute.""  The two men made eye contact with Anjos, turned around, and jogged down a path into the park.', 'After the two men jogged away, Anjos remained in the police cruiser and radioed dispatch that three men', 'fitting the descriptions provided by the victim were traveling through the park', 'Page 533', ""toward Dale Street.  Boston police Officers Christopher R. Carr and David Santosuosso, who had heard the original broadcast of the breaking and entering, were very near Dale Street and headed in that direction.  Arriving quickly, Carr and Santosuosso observed two males matching Anjos's description walking out of the park toward Dale Street.  Carr parked the cruiser on Dale Street and both officers approached the defendant and his companion as they left the park.  The defendant and his companion walked with their hands out of their pockets.  Carr saw no bulges in their clothing suggesting the presence of weapons or contraband."", 'Carr was closer to the two males, approximately fifteen yards away.  When he uttered the words, ""Hey fellas,"" the defendant turned and ran up a hill back into the park.  His companion stood still.  Carr ordered the defendant to stop running.  After the command to stop, Carr observed the defendant clutching the right side of his pants, a motion Carr described as consistent with carrying a gun without a holster.', '', 'Ignoring the command to stop, the defendant continued to run and eventually turned onto Wakullah Street.  Carr lost sight of the defendant for a few seconds before catching up with him in the rear yard of a house on Wakullah Street.  Carr drew his firearm, pointed it at the defendant, and yelled several verbal commands for the defendant to show his hands and to ""get down, get down, get down.""  The defendant moved slowly, conduct that Carr interpreted as an intention not to comply with his commands.  After a brief struggle, Carr arrested and searched the defendant but found no contraband on his person.  Minutes after the arrest, police recovered a Walther .22 caliber firearm inside the front yard fence of the Wakullah Street house.  When asked if he had a license to carry a firearm, the defendant replied that he did not.', ""Discussion.  The defendant challenges the judge's denial of the motion to suppress, claiming error in the judge's ruling that at the time of the stop on Dale Street, the police had a sufficient factual basis for reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed the breaking and entering."", 'In sum, he argues that the police', 'Page 534', 'pursued him with the intent of questioning him, while lacking any basis for doing so.  Accordingly, he claims that any behavior observed during the pursuit and any contraband found thereafter must be suppressed.', '1.  Standard of review.

We apply these principles in deciding whether the seizure was justified by reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed the breaking and entering on Hutchings Street.  Commonwealth v. Scott,', ', 646 (2004).', '2.  Reasonable suspicion.  The judge ruled, and the Commonwealth concedes, that the seizure occurred when Officer Carr ordered the defendant to stop running and pursued him onto Wakullah Street.  If a seizure occurs, ""we ask whether the stop was based on an officer\'s reasonable suspicion that the person was committing, had committed, or was about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Martin,', ', 303 (2014).  ""That suspicion must be grounded in \'specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences [drawn] therefrom\' rather than on a hunch.""  Commonwealth v. DePeiza,', ', 371 (2007), quoting Scott, 440 Mass. at 646.  The essence of the reasonable suspicion inquiry is whether the police have an individualized suspicion that the person seized is the perpetrator of the suspected crime.  Commonwealth v. Depina,', ', 243 (2010) (stop is lawful only if ""information on which the dispatch was based had sufficient indicia of reliability, and . . . the description of the suspect conveyed by the dispatch had sufficient particularity that it was reasonable for the police to suspect a person matching that description"").', 'According to the judge\'s ruling, the following information established reasonable suspicion for the investigatory stop:  the defendant and his companion ""matched"" the description of two of', 'Page 535', 'the three individuals being sought by the police; they were stopped in close proximity in location (one mile) and time (approximately twenty-five minutes) to the crime; they were the only persons observed on the street on a cold winter night as police canvassed the area; and they evaded contact with the police, first when both men jogged away into the park, and later when the defendant fled from Carr after being approached on the other side of the park.', '', 'We review the judge\'s findings as a whole, bearing in mind that ""a combination of factors that are each innocent of themselves may, when taken together, amount to the requisite reasonable belief"" that a person has, is, or will commit a particular crime.  Commonwealth v. Feyenord,', ', 77 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006), quoting Commonwealth v. Fraser,', ', 545 (1991).  We are not persuaded that the information available to the police at the time of the seizure was sufficiently specific to establish reasonable suspicion that the defendant was connected to the breaking and entering under investigation.', 'a.  The description of the suspects.  First, and perhaps most important, because the victim had given a very general description of the perpetrator and his accomplices, the police did not know whom they were looking for that evening, except that the suspects were three black males:  two black males wearing the ubiquitous and nondescriptive ""dark clothing,"" and one black male wearing a ""red hoodie.""  Lacking any information about facial features, hairstyles, skin tone, height, weight, or other physical characteristics, the victim\'s description ""contribute[d] nothing to the officers\' ability to distinguish the defendant from any other black male"" wearing dark clothes and a ""hoodie"" in Roxbury.  Commonwealth v. Cheek,', ', 496 (1992) (insufficient detail in generalized description of suspect to justify stop where defendant was observed walking on street approximately one-half mile from scene of reported stabbing, without indication he was fleeing crime scene or had engaged in criminal activity).', 'With only this vague description, it was simply not possible for the police reasonably and rationally to target the defendant or any', 'Page 536', 'other black male wearing dark clothing as a suspect in the crime.  If anything, the victim\'s description tended to exclude the defendant as a suspect:  he was one of two men, not three; he was not wearing a red ""hoodie""; and, neither he nor his companion was carrying a backpack.', 'Based solely on this description, Anjos had nothing more than a hunch that the defendant might have been involved in the crime.  He acknowledged as much when he explained that the purpose of the stop was ""to figure out who they were and where they were coming from and possibly do an FIO.""  As noted, an FIO is a consensual encounter between an individual and a police officer.  Therefore, the defendant was not a ""suspect"" subject to the intrusion of a threshold inquiry.  Unless the police were able to fortify the bare-bones description of the perpetrators with other facts probative of reasonable suspicion, the defendant was entitled to proceed uninhibited as he walked through the streets of Roxbury that evening.', 'b.  Proximity.  We agree with the motion judge that proximity of the stop to the time and location of the crime is a relevant factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis.  Commonwealth v. Foster,', ', 672-673, 676 (2000) (reasonable suspicion established where police observed persons matching physical description on same street and headed in same direction as indicated by informant).  Proximity is accorded greater probative value in the reasonable suspicion calculus when the distance is short and the timing is close.  See Commonwealth v. Doocey,', "", 555 n.8 (2002), and cases cited.  Here, the defendant was stopped one mile from the scene of the crime approximately twenty-five minutes after the victim's telephone call to the police.  Several considerations, however, weigh against proximity as a factor supporting an individualized suspicion of the defendant as a suspect in the breaking and entering."", ""The location and timing of the stop were no more than random occurrences and not probative of individualized suspicion where the direction of the perpetrator's path of flight was mere conjecture.  Although the police appropriately began their investigation with the information available to them, this lack of detail made it less likely that a sighting of potential suspects could be elevated beyond the level of a hunch or speculation.  As noted by the dissenting Justices in the Appeals Court opinion, given the nearly"", 'Page 537', 'thirty-minute time period between the breaking and entering and the stop on Dale Street, the suspects could have traveled on foot within a two mile radius of the crime scene, a substantial geographic area comprising 12.57 square miles.', ""Warren, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 499 n. 1 (Rubin, J., dissenting).  See id. at 488-489 (Agnes, J., dissenting).  Other than the victim's report that the perpetrators fled toward Harold Street, the responding officers had nothing more than the information in the dispatch suggesting that the perpetrators could have fled toward Seaver Street or Walnut Avenue.  Depending on the direction taken, these paths of flight would lead to different Boston neighborhoods, Dorchester or Jamaica Plain, in different areas of the city."", 'In addition, Anjos testified to two important geographical facts that undermine the proximity factor.  He acknowledged that Dale Street is in the opposite direction from where either of the reported paths of flight might lead.  And, most important, Anjos also stated that if the perpetrators had headed in the direction of Dale Street, they likely would have reached that location well before his first encounter with the defendant and his companion.  Thus, where the timing and location of the stop lacked a rational relationship to each other, proximity lacks force as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.', 'c.  Lack of other pedestrians.  The judge considered in her analysis that the defendant and his companion were the only people observed on the street as Anjos canvassed the four to five block radius of the Hutchings Street address, traveling ""up and down Harold Street, Walnut Avenue and Holworthy Street"" before turning onto Martin Luther King Boulevard to return to the station.', 'This factor also is of questionable value in the analysis given the lapse of time and the narrow geographical scope of the', 'Page 538', ""search for suspicious persons.  Anjos spoke to the victim for approximately fifteen minutes and thereafter canvassed only four to five blocks surrounding the location of the breaking and entering.  The lapse of time between the victim's report and the canvassing suggests that the perpetrators could have fled the immediate area before Anjos began his search.  Thus, the defendant's presence on the street, some distance away from the crime, within a time frame inconsistent with having recently fled the scene, is hardly revelatory of an individualized suspicion of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime."", ""d.  Flight.  We recognize that the defendant's evasive conduct during his successive encounters with police is a factor properly considered in the reasonable suspicion analysis.  Commonwealth v. Stoute,"", "", 791 (1996) (failure to stop combined with accelerated pace contributed to officer's reasonable suspicion).  But evasive conduct in the absence of any other information tending toward an individualized suspicion that the defendant was involved in the crime is insufficient to support reasonable suspicion.  Commonwealth v. Mercado,"", ', 371 (1996) (""Neither evasive behavior, proximity to a crime scene, nor matching a general description is alone sufficient to support . . . reasonable suspicion""); Commonwealth v. Thibeau,', ', 764 (1981) (quick maneuver to avoid contact with police insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion).  ""Were the rule otherwise, the police could turn a hunch into a reasonable suspicion by inducing the [flight] justifying the suspicion.""  Stoute, supra at 789, quoting Thibeau, supra.  Although flight is relevant to the reasonable suspicion analysis in appropriate circumstances, we add two cautionary notes regarding the weight to be given this factor.', ""First, we perceive a factual irony in the consideration of flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.    Unless reasonable suspicion for a threshold inquiry already exists, our law guards a person's freedom to speak or not to speak to a police officer.  A person also may choose to walk away, avoiding altogether any contact with police.  Commonwealth v. Barros,"", ', 178 (2001) (breaking eye contact and refusing to answer officer\'s initial questions did not provide reasonable suspicion for detention or seizure as ""[i]t was the defendant\'s right to ignore the officer"").  Yet, because flight is viewed as inculpatory, we have endorsed it as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis.  See Commonwealth v. Sykes,', "", 315 (2007) (defendant's"", 'Page 539', 'abandonment of bicycle in ""effort to dodge further contact with the police was significant"" in determining reasonable suspicion); Commonwealth v. Grandison,', "", 139-140 (2001) (attempt to avoid contact with police may be considered with other factors in establishing reasonable suspicion).  Where a suspect is under no obligation to respond to a police officer's inquiry, we are of the view that flight to avoid that contact should be given little, if any, weight as a factor probative of reasonable suspicion.  Otherwise, our long-standing jurisprudence establishing the boundary between consensual and obligatory police encounters will be seriously undermined.  Thus, in the circumstances of this case, the flight from Anjos during the initial encounter added nothing to the reasonable suspicion calculus."", 'Second, as set out by one of the dissenting Justices in the Appeals court opinion, where the suspect is a black male stopped by the police on the streets of Boston, the analysis of flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus cannot be divorced from the findings in a recent Boston Police Department (department) report documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston. Warren, 87 Mass. App. Ct. at 495 n.18 (Agnes. J., dissenting), citing Boston Police Commissioner Announces Field Interrogation and Observation (FIO) Study Results, http://bpdnews.com/news/2014/10/8/boston-police-commissioner-announces-field-interrogation-and-observation-fio-study-results [https://perma.cc/H9RJ-RHNB].', 'According to the study, based on FIO data collected by the department,', 'black men in the city of Boston were more likely to be targeted for police-civilian encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations, and interrogations.', 'Black men were also disproportionally targeted for', 'Page 540', 'repeat police encounters.', ""We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop.  However, in such circumstances, flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt.  Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted for FIO encounters suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt.  Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity.

Through the family tree program, the police accessed a mailing label containing the name ""Sebastiano Passanisi,"" the victim\'s brother-in-law, with a Malden address, consistent with the return address on the package containing the bomb.

We reject each argument."", ""a.  Motion to suppress informant's testimony.  In his pretrial motion to suppress Dubis's testimony, the defendant argued that Dubis was a government agent who questioned the defendant in violation of his right to counsel -- which had attached at his arraignment -- in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights."", '""The court accepts the findings of fact from a suppression hearing absent clear error,"" but independently applies constitutional principles to determine whether an informant was a government agent.

We conclude that the judge properly denied the motion to suppress because Dubis was not the Commonwealth's agent when he spoke to the defendant.  See Commonwealth v. Tevlin,"", ', 320 (2001); Harmon, supra at 428-429.', ""In a written decision, the judge made the following findings related to Dubis's previous involvement as a government informant.  Dubis first acted as a government informant in 1988, while serving a sentence in a house of correction.  He also testified for the Commonwealth in two murder trials.  See Commonwealth v. Tevlin,"", '(2001); Commonwealth v. Bennett,', ""(1997).  Following Dubis's testimony in one of the cases, his attorney asked Plath for assistance in securing house of correction sentences for Dubis, rather than State prison sentences, out of concern for Dubis's safety.  Plath agreed to speak with law enforcement responsible for the relevant prosecutions.  In a separate matter, when Dubis was not in jail, Dubis provided information to Plath and received twenty-five dollars as reimbursement for gasoline."", 'The judge also found that no one, including Plath, promised Dubis any assistance in return for information he provided.  Between his 1998 sentencing and his testimony at the motion to suppress hearing in 2003, Dubis sought parole three times.  Dubis was denied parole on each occasion, and no law enforcement official spoke on his behalf at any parole hearing.', 'The Sixth Amendment and art. 12', 'prohibit the Commonwealth from ""deliberately elicit[ing]"" incriminating statements from an individual who has been charged with a crime, without the individual\'s counsel present.  Tevlin, 433 Mass. at 320, quoting United States v. Massiah, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964).  In addition to direct questioning, the government deliberately elicits statements by ""intentionally creating a situation likely to induce"" the', 'Page 282', 'charged individual to make incriminating statements in the absence of counsel.  United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 274 (1980); Harmon, 410 Mass. at 428, citing Massiah, supra at 206.  There is no dispute that Dubis intentionally elicited incriminating statements from the defendant to pass on to law enforcement for his own advantage.  The only question is whether Dubis was a government agent.', '""The United States Supreme Court has not clearly defined the point at which agency arises.""  Murphy, 448 Mass. at 460.  Yet, at a minimum, there must be some arrangement between the Commonwealth and the informant before the informant\'s actions can be attributed to the Commonwealth.  See id. at 463-464, 467 (articulated agreement between informant and Commonwealth containing specific benefit creates agency relationship [citation omitted]).  An inmate\'s ""unencouraged hope to curry favor"" by informing does not establish an agency relationship, even if the informant subsequently receives a benefit (citation omitted).  Harmon, 410 Mass. at 428.  See Commonwealth v. Rancourt,', ', 274 (1987).  See also Moulton, 474 U.S. at 176.  Nor does the fact that an informant provided information in the past establish an agency relationship.  Rancourt, supra at 272, 274.', 'No agency relationship exists in the absence of a prior arrangement between the Commonwealth and the informant.  For example, no agency relationship forms when the Commonwealth does not promise a benefit to an informant, even where -- as in this case -- the informant has provided information to a particular police officer on multiple prior occasions.  Harmon, 410 Mass. at 429-430  By contrast, in the Murphy case, an informant was a government agent, because an assistant United States attorney offered to file a motion to reduce the informant\'s sentence ""if he gave \'substantial assistance\' to the government.""  Murphy, 448 Mass. at 465, 467-468.  In the Henry case, the government paid an informant on a contingency fee basis for information, encouraging the informant to elicit incriminating information from other inmates.  Henry, 447 U.S. at 270-271, 274.  Even though the government instructed the informant not to question the defendant in the Henry case, the Supreme Court concluded that keeping the informant near Henry in prison and utilizing the contingency fee arrangement for information, tended to show that the government ""intentionally creat[ed] a situation likely to induce Henry to make incriminating statements.""  Id. at 266, 270-271, 274.  See United States v. Brink, 39 F.3d 419, 423-424  (3d Cir. 1994)', 'Page 283', '(intentional placement of known informant in cell may constitute deliberate effort to elicit incriminating information).', 'Based on the facts established at the motion to suppress hearing, Dubis was not an agent of the Commonwealth.  No evidence suggests that the Commonwealth put the defendant and Dubis in the same cell in order to elicit information from the defendant.  Nor does the evidence show that any law enforcement official involved in the defendant\'s case knew that Dubis and the defendant would be placed in the same cell or that their encounter was the result of anything but happenstance.  That Dubis had provided information to a particular officer on more than one occasion does not demonstrate that he was a government agent.  Harmon, 410 Mass. at 429.  Dubis is unlike the informant in the Harmon case, who had reached out to the officer after making first contact with the defendant.  Id. at 429.  The defendant in the Harmon case confessed his guilt to the informant only after the officer told the informant to ""keep his ears open.""  Id.  We concluded that the informant in the Harmon case was not a government agent, and the evidence suggesting Dubis was a government agent is even weaker.  See id. at 429-430.  Although Plath similarly told Dubis to ""keep his ears open,"" all of Dubis\'s contact with law enforcement regarding the defendant\'s case took place after Dubis\'s sole conversation with the defendant.', ""Dubis's conduct as an informant is also unlike the informants in Murphy, 448 Mass. at 457, and Henry, 447 U.S. at 271, 274, because each of them had in place, before eliciting incriminating information, an articulated agreement with the government, pursuant to which the informants received specific benefits."", 'As referenced above, the facts in this case do not even suggest that', 'Page 284', 'the Commonwealth planned for Dubis and the defendant to share a cell.

We disagree.', ""Prior consistent statements are generally inadmissible.  Mass. G. Evid. § 613(b)(1) (2016).

Defense counsel elicited that, until the week of the trial, Dubis had not seen the report generated by his initial interview with police regarding the defendant.  Defense counsel also suggested that Dubis was expecting assistance at upcoming parole hearings and that Dubis intended to ask the prosecution in this case to assist him with obtaining release from prison early and being placed on a bracelet.  Defense counsel then asked Dubis, ""So all of a sudden you were shown what they want you to say, isn\'t that right?""  This question suggested a recent contrivance, improper influence or bias, and the trial judge permitted the Commonwealth to rehabilitate Dubis using his initial statement.', 'The defendant argues that the rehabilitation was improper because Dubis had the same motive to fabricate (i.e., to ingratiate himself with law enforcement) at the time he made his prior statement.  Although that may be true, defense counsel indicated a particular event influenced Dubis\'s testimony by alleging the Commonwealth showed Dubis ""what they want[ed] [him] to say"" in the week leading up to trial.  The Commonwealth was entitled to rebut that suggestion.  See Rivera, 430 Mass. at 100; Zukoski, 370 Mass. at 27.

When McLean launched the program, it contained the victim's horoscope information.  McLean testified that the information was last accessed on January 19, 2000 -- the day before the victim's death.

Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found the following.  In the afternoon of June 5, 2011, the defendant was brought by ambulance and against his will to the emergency department of a hospital.  There he was involuntarily detained in a small room in the psychiatric area of the hospital's emergency department.  Although this detention was purportedly pursuant to G. L. c. 123, § 12 (a), which allows the temporary restraint and hospitalization of persons posing a serious risk of harm by reason of mental illness, according to the defendant, who testified at trial, he was shown no evidence of compliance with the procedures required by § 12 (a), nor was any such evidence produced at trial."", 'When told he would likely be held in the hospital for two or three days, the defendant began to shout.  Medical staff requested assistance from hospital security officers and, on their arrival, instructed the officers not to allow the defendant to leave.  At approximately 8 P.M., a security officer called for additional assistance; at least four other security responded.  At least one officer was armed with a baton and handcuffs in addition to the pepper spray that was carried by at least three officers.', 'The officers attempted to persuade the defendant to take medication that he told them he did not want.  Having heard the defendant repeatedly say, ""I don\'t want to take the medication.  I want to get out of here,"" the officers told him that if he refused to take the medication, he would be restrained, and later, that if he did not comply with orders he would be pepper sprayed.', 'In response to the officers\' orders, the defendant stated, ""I\'m not taking any medications.  You can\'t hold me here against my will""; ""I don\'t want to fuck anybody up, but I guarantee I\'m leaving one way or the other""; ""if anybody puts their hands on me, I\'m going to fuck them up""; and ""if anybody pepper sprays me I\'m going to beat the fuck out of them.""  Furthermore, when', 'Page 471', 'the officers first entered the room, the defendant had said, ""The first person in, I\'m going to break their arm.  And then the next person in, I\'m going to break theirs, and then the next, and then the next.""  Other patients were ""looking on""; as a precautionary measure, officers directed anyone in the hallway to an alternate route ""just in case something happened if [the confrontation] spilled out"" of the room.', 'The officers asked the defendant to calm down, and repeated their request that he accept medication.', 'The defendant took his shirt off,', 'and began pacing with clenched fists, hitting the open palm of one hand with the clenched fist of the other.  He repeated his desire to leave, insisted no one was going to stop him, and refused to sit on a stretcher to be restrained.  He then adopted a ""fighting"" stance.', '', 'After officers threatened the use of pepper spray and approached the defendant, the defendant ""put his hands out like he wanted to fight.""  At least three, and as many as six, officers then directed pepper spray at the defendant\'s head and face.', 'The defendant retreated into a corner of the room and subsequently agreed to sit on the stretcher, where he was handcuffed before the spray was rinsed off him.', 'b.

He moved for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case and again at the close of his case; the trial judge denied each motion.  The judge also refused the defendant's requested instructions as to his right to use self-defense against excessive force, unlawful detention, and forcible medication.  The jury acquitted the defendant of assault, but convicted him of disorderly conduct, and failed to agree on a verdict on the charge of threatening to commit a crime.  Consistent with § 53, the judge imposed a fine on the disorderly conduct conviction.  The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal, and this court allowed his application for direct appellate review."", '2.  Discussion.  a.  Sufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of disorderly conduct under G. L. c. 272, § 53.  Specifically, he argues the Commonwealth failed to prove either (1) his recklessness in creating a risk of ""public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm,"" or (2) the ""public"" character of any such risk.  In reviewing this claim, we consider the evidence introduced at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 676-677 (1979).', 'General Laws c. 272, § 53, provides that being a ""[d]isorderly person[] and disturber[] of the peace"" is a criminal offense punishable by a fine for the first offense.', 'In order to interpret the term and ensure its constitutionality, this court has ""engrafted the Model Penal Code definition of \'disorderly\' onto the separate § 53 offense"" of being a disorderly person.  Commonwealth v. Chou,', ', 231-232 (2001).  As so construed, the disorderly conduct provision in § 53 requires proof that a person, ""with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm,', 'Page 473', 'or recklessly creating a risk thereof,"" engage in ""fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior"" or create ""a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.""  Commonwealth v.

Feigenbaum,', ', 475 (1989), quoting Model Penal Code § 250.2(2)(c) (Official Draft and Revised Comments, 1985) (disorderly conduct conviction requires proof that defendant ""consciously disregard[ed] a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct"").', '""Conviction cannot be had merely on proof that an actor should have foreseen the risk of public annoyance or alarm.""  Model Penal Code § 250.2 comment 2, at 329 (1980).', 'Against this backdrop, the defendant argues there was insufficient evidence that he recklessly created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.  We agree.  The Commonwealth argues the evidence shows that the defendant\'s ""violent and tumultuous behavior"" was motivated by his desire to leave the room despite the officers\' contrary warnings and regardless of the consequences, causing public inconvenience, annoyance, and alarm and requiring that traffic be rerouted around his hospital room.  The totality of this causal relationship is doubtful, given that the rerouting of hospital traffic was initiated by the security officers as a prophylactic step and there was no evidence that it was actually needed.  But even assuming the validity of the', 'Page 474', 'Commonwealth\'s characterization of the scene, the fact that the defendant\'s behavior caused officers to reroute and inconvenience people does not mean that the defendant was aware that his behavior had this effect, and acted in conscious disregard of its occurrence.  No evidence was presented that the defendant ever went out of the room he was in; that he knew of the hospital pedestrian rerouting officers decided to institute; or that he saw any patients ""looking on"" through the window into the room.  Quoting Justice Holmes, the Commonwealth claims that recklessness ""in a moral sense"" signifies ""a certain state of consciousness with reference to the consequences of one\'s acts,"" Commonwealth v. Pierce,', ', 175 (1884), and that a failure to predict the consequences is immaterial if, ""under the circumstances known to [the defendant], the . . . jury . . . thought them obvious.""  Id. at 178.  This elegantly phrased observation seems contrary to the Model Penal Code\'s statement of the standard as set out in comment 2 to § 250.2, but even if Justice Holmes\'s statement did represent an appropriate articulation of the standard, by its terms, it depends on ""the circumstances', '"" (emphasis added).  Id.  It bears emphasis that at the time of this incident, according to the Commonwealth, the defendant had been brought to and was detained in the hospital\'s emergency department because he was thought to be dangerous to himself or to others by reason of mental illness.  See G. L. c. 123, § 12.  We do not decide that a person detained in such circumstances can never satisfy the intent element of the crime of disorderly conduct, but in the circumstances presented here, without any evidence showing or even suggesting that the defendant was at all aware that his conduct had any impact on anyone in the hospital outside his room, the Commonwealth has failed to prove that the defendant acted with the requisite conscious disregard of an ""unjustifiable risk"" of public annoyance or alarm created by his conduct.', 'Moreover, quite apart from the element of intent, in the context in which they took place, the defendant\'s actions do not amount to the sort of ""public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm"" that G. L. c. 272, § 53, targets.  See Instructing 7.160 of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2009).  Disorderly conduct embraces those activities which ""intentionally tend to disturb the public tranquility, or alarm or provoke others"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. A Juvenile,', ', 595-596 (1975).  See Commonwealth v. Mulvey,', ',', 'Page 475', '584 (2003) (characterizing ""tendency of the actor\'s conduct to provoke violence in others"" as foundational to theory behind criminalizing disorderly conduct).

In concluding that the defendant\'s outburst ""went far beyond the level of noise and commotion ordinarily encountered in court house hallways,"" the court considered relevant both the spectators who gathered', 'and ""the number of persons who abandoned their ordinary duties to respond to that noise and commotion.""  Id. at 729.  These included a court officer leaving a sitting judge to follow the defendant through the building; an assistant district attorney interrupting a meeting to check on the safety of the attorneys she supervised; and three police officers abandoning their posts to investigate the disturbance.

Id.', 'The same cannot be said of the defendant\'s conduct in this case.  His behavior in the emergency department did not attract the crowd of onlookers that typifies public disturbance under our law.  See note 10, supra.  All the evidence shows is that the behavior was witnessed and experienced by the hospital\'s treating staff attending the defendant and the security officers called in by the staff.  The evidence would permit a finding that unquantified ""other"" patients may have observed the defendant\'s loud and aggressive behavior in his room; ""other"" patients looking in on a patient arguably out of control in a small hospital room does not qualify as the kind of public disturbance that § 53 is intended to address.', 'Indeed, far from going ""way beyond"" a hospital\'s day-to-day ""hurly-burly,"" a patient\'s resistance to detention and medication would seem to be the kind of disruption a psychiatric area in the', 'Page 477', ""hospital's emergency department is designed to absorb."", 'The responding officers, moreover, were not leaving their posts, but carrying out an assignment that fit squarely within their job to provide security to the hospital community.', 'Where the inquiry is setting-specific, Sholley, 432 Mass. at 730 n.11, criminal charges of disorderly conduct in the context of mental health treatment in the emergency department of a large urban hospital, although not per se unavailable, should be rare.  To decide otherwise risks criminalizing mental illness in the very treatment centers where help must be available.', ""We do not minimize the challenges faced by staff in the psychiatric ward of a large hospital like the one here, including the hospital's security officers.  This would be a very different case if the defendant had actually struck a member of the hospital staff or had intentionally or recklessly caused a substantial disruption to other patients or hospital operations.  Here, however, the jury found the defendant not guilty of assault and reached no verdict on the charge of threatening to commit a crime.  The defendant's belligerent actions, given their context and location, do not rise to the level of disorderly conduct."", 'In sum, considering all the evidence in this case in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we conclude that it was not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant consciously disregarded a ""substantial and unjustifiable risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.""  The defendant\'s conviction of disorderly conduct must be reversed.', '', 'b.  Additional considerations.  The defendant argues in this case that his detention in the hospital and the forced administration of medication without his consent were unlawful, and that as a consequence, he was entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense in relation to all three of the criminal charges against him.  We', 'Page 478', 'need not reach this issue in light of the fact that the defendant was found guilty only of disorderly conduct, and we have concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support that conviction.', 'The defendant is correct, however, that as a general matter, the involuntary hospitalization and forcible medication of an individual on account of mental illness is not permitted unless there is compliance with the specific statutory requirements of G. L. c. 123, §§ 12 and 21.  It has long been the law that medical treatment of a competent patient without his consent is a battery, and is permitted only for incompetent patients where procedural protections are followed.  See, e.g., Matter of Spring,', "", 638 (1980), and cases cited.  See also Rogers v.

The parole board did not hold a hearing between 1994 and 2000 while the defendant was at liberty.  The defendant, therefore, took advantage of his interpretation of the plea agreement (adopted by the court) that he be allowed to withdraw his plea if he were required to go into custody as a condition of his parole hearing.

At trial, the jury heard about O'Malley's background and experience with Cape Verdean gangs.  The defendant contends that the judge abused her discretion in allowing this testimony, both because O'Malley was not qualified and because his testimony was based on inadmissible hearsay.  The Commonwealth argues that the evidence was properly admitted to prove motive, and was based on the qualified expert's personal knowledge.  There was no error."", 'Expert opinion testimony ""must rest on a proper basis, else inadmissible evidence might enter in the guise of expert opinion.""  Commonwealth v. Waite,', "", 803 (1996).

A Juvenile,"", "", 531 (1986).  Here, O'Malley's extensive experience"", 'Page 668', ""with Cape Verdean gangs generally, and with the victim and defendant specifically, qualified him as an expert and provided direct personal knowledge for the testimony he offered.  O'Malley served as lead investigator from the Boston police department in an approximately two-year joint investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Woodward Avenue gang members, which concluded in January, 2013.  Before that, he was a patrolman in the Dorchester section of Boston for seven years, and assigned to the youth violence strike force gang unit for another two.  In both capacities, O'Malley logged countless conversations with Cape Verdean residents -- including concerned citizens, cultivated informants, and admitted gang members -- and from these interactions, he made determinations of gang affiliation.  He testified to individual affiliations within the Woodward Avenue and Wendover Street gangs; to the territorial reach of each gang; and to the history of the gangs as aligned until about 2005, when a split gave rise to a feud active at the time of the victim's death.  O'Malley knew the victim since about 2005, and had observed him with Wendover Street gang associates and at the addresses of the gang's headquarters on several occasions.  He was similarly familiar with the defendant, whom he had observed wearing Woodward Avenue gang colors and in the presence of Woodward Avenue gang leaders on multiple occasions.  O'Malley also testified that the defendant had left the Wendover Street gang for the Woodward Avenue gang in 2006 and that, as a result, animosity remained between the defendant and a leader of the Wendover Street gang."", ""O'Malley's testimony, based on his personal knowledge, was admissible.

Smith,"", ', 399, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 893 (2008) (rejecting hearsay challenge to officer\'s gang opinion testimony based on ""use of informants, street sources of information, the school police, teachers, probation officers, enemies,"" where officer had personal familiarity with victim, defendant, and their respective gangs).', 'The Commonwealth\'s theory was that there was a joint venture motivated by this ongoing rivalry between the Woodward Avenue and Wendover Street gangs.  Evidence of the defendant\'s affiliation with the Woodward Avenue gang was probative of motive, and provided necessary context for the defendant\'s statement to the victim (""You don\'t belong here"").  See Commonwealth v. Correa,', ', 201 (2002) (""[W]here evidence of gang affiliation is relevant to the defendant\'s motive, it is within the', 'Page 669', 'discretion of the judge to weigh the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect"").', ""Moreover, the judge took precautions to minimize any prejudicial impact of the gang opinion testimony.  She conducted individual voir dire with each juror, using three agreed-upon questions to confirm the juror's capacity to consider the evidence only for its limited purpose.  Each time the evidence was introduced, it was accompanied by a thorough limiting instruction, which was repeated in the final charge.  Especially where the judge carefully cabined properly admitted testimony with limiting instructions, voir dire, and exclusion of any references to prior acts of gang-related violence, admitting that testimony in evidence was not an error.  See Smith, 450 Mass. at 400, and cases cited."", '3.  Prosecutor\'s opening statement and closing argument.  The defendant argues that the prosecutor\'s opening statement and closing argument, to which the defendant did not object, were improper.  ""Although not dispositive, we consider the fact that the defendant did not object to the statements at trial as \'some indication that the tone [and] manner . . . of the now challenged aspects of the prosecutor\'s argument were not unfairly prejudicial.\'""  Commonwealth v. Lyons,', ', 471 (1998), quoting Commonwealth v. Mello,', ', 380 (1995).  We conclude that there was no error.', '""The proper function of an opening is to outline in a general way the nature of the case which the counsel expects to be able to prove or support by evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Croken,', ', 268 (2000), quoting Commonwealth v. Fazio,', ', 454 (1978).  ""[A] claim of improper [opening statement] by the prosecutor must be judged in light of the entire [statement], the judge\'s instructions to the jury, and the evidence actually introduced at trial.""  Commonwealth v. Jones,', ', 260-261 (2003), quoting Commonwealth v. Thomas,', ', 158 (1999).  Here, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury\'s emotions by reminding them that they saw where the shooter emerged from the alley during the view of the crime scene, and by using phrases such as ""killing team"" and ""stalking and hunting,"" during his opening statement.  The prosecutor\'s statements were not improper, as they were merely ""enthusiastic rhetoric.""  See Commonwealth v. Simpson,', ', 586 (2001).  Moreover, ""to the degree the recitation of the evidence was inflammatory, that was inherent in', 'Page 670', 'the odious . . . nature of the crime[] committed"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Johnson,', ', 749 (1999).  The jury were properly instructed before the opening statements, and in the final charge, that the statements were not evidence.', 'Similarly, ""[c]losing arguments must be viewed \'in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\'s instruction to the jury, and the evidence at trial.\'""  Commonwealth v. Braley,', ', 328-329 (2007), quoting Commonwealth v. Colon-Cruz,', "", 553 (1990).  The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's emotions when he encouraged the jurors to use their recollections of the view to evaluate the evidence.  He also claims that the prosecutor used improper forceful rhetoric in describing the victim's murder and the defendant's actions and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he asked the jurors to hold the defendant accountable for his actions."", 'The prosecutor properly encouraged the jury to use their observations from the view to evaluate the evidence and aid in reaching their verdict.  See Commonwealth v. Corliss,', ', 448 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Gomes,', ', 199 (2011) (""[a]lthough what is seen on the view may be used by the jury in reaching their verdict, in a \'strict and narrow sense a view may be thought not to be evidence\'"").  Similarly, the prosecutor\'s forceful rhetoric was based on the evidence without focusing on any unnecessarily emotional or inflammatory aspects of the evidence.  See Lyons, 426 Mass. at 472.  Moreover, the prosecutor\'s description of the victim\'s murder was based on the evidence and was relevant to establish the nature of the crime.  See Commonwealth v. Sanchez,', ', 376 (1989), quoting Commonwealth v. Kozec,', ', 521 (1987) (""Although this line of argument may evoke sympathy for the victim[], the argument went to the issues in the case and was \'based on what the jury saw and heard\'"").  The judge instructed the jury prior to the arguments and in the final charge that closing statements were not evidence, and specifically instructed the jury to ""not decide this case in any way based on sympathy towards the victim or the victim\'s family or any sympathy towards the defendant.""  The prosecutor\'s statement reminding the jury that the victim\'s murder occurred nearly two years prior to the trial and that the time for the defendant\'s accountability is now, was not improper.  Although the statement regarding the defendant\'s accountability was better left unsaid, ""[t]he prosecutor\'s remarks', 'Page 671', 'were characteristic of \'enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole,\' and did not cross the line between fair and improper argument.""  Lyons, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Sanna,', ', 107 (1997).  Contrast Commonwealth v. Torres,', ', 464-465 (2002) (improper argument where prosecutor asked jury to ""answer the call for justice and hold [the defendant] accountable for what he did"").  The prosecutor\'s statement ""falls within the category of permissible rhetoric and . . . there was no error.""  Commonwealth v. Mejia,', ', 255 (2012).', ""The defendant claims that the prosecutor also improperly encouraged the jurors to use evidence that Montrond returned the rented Cadillac the day after the murder as evidence of the defendant's participation in the joint venture.  We do not agree.  The prosecutor was entitled to argue inferences from the evidence that are favorable to the Commonwealth's case.  See Lyons, 426 Mass. at 472.  The jury reasonably could infer that in order to cover up his participation in the joint venture, Montrond returned the Cadillac the day after the murder, before the end of his rental contract.  The jury could further infer the defendant's knowing participation based on his presence in the Cadillac that evening and the surveillance footage depicting the Cadillac following the defendant's vehicle on multiple occasions that evening.  See id."", 'Finally, the defendant\'s argument that the prosecutor improperly suggested that the jury\'s job was ""easier"" because they could find the defendant guilty of joint venture without determining whether he was the shooter or a coventurer is without merit.  The prosecutor correctly stated the law of joint venture and the Commonwealth\'s burden.  See Commonwealth v. Deane,', ', 50-51 (2010) (""the Commonwealth is not required to prove exactly how a joint venturer participated in the murder[], . . . or which of the [coventurers] did the actual killing"" [citation omitted]).', '4.  Evidentiary rulings.  The defendant argues that the judge committed reversible error in (1) allowing inadmissible statements that unfairly bolstered the Commonwealth\'s theory of gang retaliation and (2) allowing improper ""interpretive"" testimony from the lead homicide detective.  We address these arguments in turn.', 'a.  Statements by the victim\'s friends.  The defendant challenges the admission of statements from Rosa and one of the women who were with him that night describing their concern for the victim after the defendant\'s statement, ""You don\'t belong here.""', 'Page 672', 'The admission of the statements was not improper, as they were not admitted for their truth and, thus, not hearsay.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 801 (2017).  The judge noted that the witnesses\' statements were admissible ""to put in context"" the victim\'s statement of intent to go inside the bar and have a drink.  There was no error or abuse of discretion in admitting these statements.  See L.L. v. Commonwealth,', ', 185 n.27 (2014).', 'b.  Teixeira\'s statements.  The defendant challenges three of Teixeira\'s statements, made after she discovered that the victim had been murdered, admitted under the excited or spontaneous utterance hearsay exception through the testimony of a police officer.  As Teixeira was being transported to Boston police headquarters, she exclaimed, ""They\'re going to kill me for this.""  Thereafter, while she was waiting to be interviewed by homicide detectives, Teixeira stated, ""These people want to kill people because of the fucking street.""  And during her interview with homicide detectives, Teixeira said, ""I\'m going to die for this.""  There was no error.', 'A statement is ""[a] spontaneous utterance if (A) there is an occurrence or event sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer, and (B) the declarant\'s statement was a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.""  Mass. G. Evid. § 803(2) (2017).  See Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 623 (2002).  ""[T]here can be no definite and fixed time limit [between the incident and the statement].  Each case must depend upon its own circumstances.""  Mass. G. Evid. § 803(2) note, quoting Commonwealth v. McLaughlin,', ', 223 (1973).  ""[T]he nexus between the statement and the event that produced it is but one of many factors to consider in determining whether the declarant was, in fact, under the sway of the exciting event when she made the statement.""  Santiago, supra at 625.  A trial judge\'s determination that an utterance meets the test of admissibility should be given deference and ""only in clear cases . . . of an improper exercise of discretion should [the judge\'s] ruling be revised"" (citation omitted).  McLaughlin, supra.', ""Here, the Commonwealth used Teixeira's statements to support its theory that the victim's murder was motivated by the ongoing feud between the Wendover Street and Woodward Avenue gangs and by retaliation for the defendant's and Lopes's injuries from the December, 2011, altercation with a leader of the Wendover Street gang.  Her statements occurred after she discovered the"", 'Page 673', ""body of the victim, whom she had been seeing romantically, after he had been shot to death.  Teixeira was hysterical.  Prior to her first challenged statement, she was found by police lying on the sidewalk screaming and crying.  Officers had to physically restrain Teixeira from returning to the victim's body and hold her up so that she did not collapse, as she was unable to stand on her own.  Based on her behavior and body language, it was plain that her presence during the victim's shooting and the discovery of his body was a sufficiently startling event.  See Commonwealth v. Irene,"", ', 607, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 968 (2012) (""We have viewed the circumstances of being shot, or witnessing a shooting, as sufficiently startling to impede normal reflective thought processes"").  Additionally, just prior to Teixeira\'s statements at police headquarters, she was so emotional that she became physically ill.  Teixeira\'s emotional demeanor and physical illness shortly after the victim\'s murder and the discovery of his body are sufficient to demonstrate that Teixeira\'s statements were ""a spontaneous reaction to the [victim\'s murder] and not the result of reflective thought.""  Mass. G. Evid. § 803(2).  ""Because both criteria of the spontaneous utterance exception were satisfied, the testimony was admissible.""  Irene, supra.', 'c.  ""Interpretive"" testimony.  The defendant challenges the admission of the testimony of Detective Brian Black, one of the lead investigators on the case, on the ground that it was improper interpretive testimony that went beyond the bounds of proper lay witness testimony.  Because the defendant objected to Black\'s testimony, we review any error for prejudicial error.  See Commonwealth v. Canty,', ', 545 (2013).', ""Here, Black testified regarding the approximately four minute and thirty second time discrepancy between the bar's video surveillance footage and the defendant's GPS data.  The judge allowed Black to review a compilation of the video surveillance footage side-by-side with the GPS data to help explain the investigative significance of the evidence when the time discrepancy is accounted for.  Black testified that he had assisted in the creation of the compilation, discerned the extent of the time discrepancy between the video surveillance footage and the defendant's GPS data, and had detailed familiarity with the evidence.  His testimony properly assisted the jury in evaluating the evidence and understanding the time discrepancy.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 701 & note (2017).  Moreover, the defendant was not prejudiced by Black's testimony regarding the time discrepancy because the"", 'Page 674', ""defendant's own witness gave similar testimony, opining that the time discrepancy was approximately four minutes and thirty-five seconds.  The defendant's witness also attempted to resolve the time discrepancy by synchronizing the bar's surveillance footage and the defendant's GPS data.  There was no error."", '5.  Ineffective assistance of counsel.  The defendant argues that trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in failing to present evidence that would have countered the Commonwealth\'s theory of gang retaliation.  Specifically, the defendant asserts that trial counsel should have ""offered or directed the jury\'s attention to"" (1) a Boston police memorandum detailing the December 24, 2011, altercation, which included a nonexhaustive list of active Wendover Street gang and Woodward Avenue gang associates, and which failed to list the victim as a Wendover Street gang associate; (2) the voir dire testimony of the victim\'s sister that he was an ""associate,"" not a member, of the Wendover Street gang; and (3) the defendant\'s GPS data and cellular telephone evidence that would counter the Commonwealth\'s theory that the defendant had been stalking or searching for the victim.', '""Where, as here, the defendant has been convicted of murder in the first degree, we review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to determine whether the alleged lapse created a \'substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice,\' a standard more favorable to the defendant than the constitutional standard otherwise applied under Commonwealth v. Saferian,', ', 96 (1974).""  Commonwealth v. Fulgiam,', ', 29 (2017), quoting Wright, 411 Mass. at 681-682.  ""We focus more broadly on whether there was error and, if so, whether any such error \'was likely to have influenced the jury\'s conclusion.\'""  Fulgiam, supra, quoting Wright, supra.  ""The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that something inappropriate was likely to have unfairly influenced the jury\'s verdict.""  Commonwealth v. Painten,', ', 550 (1999).', ""Here, the defendant argues that counsel's failure to direct the jury's attention to the aforementioned pieces of evidence or seek their admission likely influenced the jury's verdict.  We disagree.  The defendant failed to establish how admission of the police memorandum and the testimony of the victim's sister that the victim was not a full-fledged member of the Wendover Street gang would have countered the Commonwealth's theory of gang retaliation.  See id.  The Commonwealth provided evidence that"", 'Page 675', 'the victim was an ""associate"" of the Wendover Street gang and that he had a friendship with a leader of that gang, who was involved in the December 24, 2011, altercation with the defendant, Lopes, and Montrond.  Similarly, evidence that the defendant traveled in the same area prior to seeing the victim at the bar does not counter the reasonable inference that after the defendant left the bar, having seen the victim, the defendant was searching the area for the victim as part of a joint venture to commit premeditated murder.  See id.  The defendant\'s assertion that trial counsel was ineffective is unavailing.', '6.  Motion to dismiss indictments.  The defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss indictments, pursuant to Commonwealth v. McCarthy,', "", 161-163 (1982), because the Commonwealth failed to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the victim's murder.  This argument has no merit."", '""Probable cause to sustain an indictment is a decidedly low standard.""  Commonwealth v. Hanright,', ', 311 (2013).  ""[A]t the very least the grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused, . . . and probable cause to arrest him"" (citation omitted).  McCarthy, 385 Mass. at 163.  ""Probable cause has been defined as \'reasonably trustworthy information . . . sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing an offense.\'""  Hanright, supra at 311-312, quoting Commonwealth v. Stevens, 362 Mass. 20 , 26 (1972).  ""Where, as here, the liability of a joint venturer is at issue, the Commonwealth must present the grand jury with evidence that the defendant both participated in, and shared the requisite mental state for, each crime charged.""  Hanright, supra at 312.  When reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment, the grand jury evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.  See Commonwealth v. Moran,', ', 885 (2009).', 'Here, the Commonwealth presented to the grand jury sufficient evidence to sustain an indictment for the murder in the first degree of the victim as part of a joint venture.  The evidence established that the defendant, Lopes, and Montrond were at the bar on the night of the murder.  Video surveillance footage from the bar established that the SUV driven by the defendant and the Cadillac driven by Montrond were circling the area of the bar that night.  Thirty minutes before the shooting, the defendant searched the bar.  Prior to the shooting, the defendant told the victim he', 'Page 676', 'should not be in the area before speeding off, which made some of the victim\'s friends concerned.  Despite Rosa\'s suggestion otherwise, the victim decided to go into the bar and have a drink.  The victim changed his mind after smoking a cigarette outside the bar and decided to leave.  The victim told Teixeira about the defendant\'s threat as they were walking toward the victim\'s vehicle and confirmed that the defendant was the person who made the threat.  Teixeira saw a man with braids, who she identified as the defendant, walking toward the vehicle and heard the victim say something like, ""You gonna do me like this, J?"" before the victim was shot.  Finally, the defendant\'s GPS data placed him within fifteen feet of the victim at or about the time of the shooting.  Based on the evidence presented to the grand jury, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was probable cause to believe that the defendant knowingly participated and shared in the intent to commit the premeditated murder of the victim.

Accordingly, we affirm the judge's order allowing in part the motion to dismiss."", ""Background.  The pertinent facts, taken from the record, are undisputed.  On January 24, 2016, a State police trooper stopped the defendant's vehicle after observing him commit several marked lane violations.  Several other troopers arrived to assist.  During the stop, the defendant was exhibiting signs of possible intoxication, including glassy or bloodshot eyes and slurred speech.  A number of field sobriety tests were conducted, which indicated that the defendant was intoxicated.  A breathalyzer test also was administered, which measured the defendant's alcohol level at 0.132 per cent.  The defendant was arrested and transported to the State police barracks, where he submitted to a blood alcohol test that registered his alcohol level to be 0.13 per cent.  The defendant was given a citation and, pursuant to § 24 (1) (f) (2), his license was revoked and his right to operate a motor vehicle was administratively suspended for thirty days.

When the trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, the defendant admitted that his license had been suspended.  The defendant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle after license suspension for OUI, in violation of § 23, third par."", 'The defendant moved to dismiss the charge of operating after a suspension for OUI.

Thus we reject the Commonwealth\'s contention that § 24 (1) (f) (2) is merely an administrative mechanism permitting police to suspend a license upon a violation of § 24 (1) (a), and that therefore § 23, third par., should be read to include § 24 (1) (f) (2).', 'We also disagree with the Commonwealth that the provisions of G.

There is a significant difference between § 24 (1) (f) (2), which requires police to suspend a license in the field immediately upon the failure of a breathalyzer test and § 24N, where confiscation occurs after a court proceeding.  Under the former, a defendant\'s license is summarily confiscated upon a determination made by the officer or officers who stop him or her, whereas ""[u]nder § 24N a judge makes the determination of intoxication in open court on the basis of an objective chemical analysis supported by substantial documentation.""  Commonwealth v. Crowell,', ', 385 (1988).  The process under § 24N affords a defendant more protections and provides him or her with the opportunity to refute evidence brought before an impartial decision maker.', 'Significantly, insofar as relevant here, the enumerated provisions in § 23, third par., clearly afford defendants the right to a court proceeding.  See notes 2-7, supra.  It is therefore eminently reasonable for the Legislature to have decided to treat defendants charged with driving with a suspended or revoked license differently depending upon whether the license was suspended by police under the field confiscation provision of § 24 (1) (f) (2), or by a judge under the in-court suspension provision of § 24N.', 'Finally, our interpretation of § 23, third par., is supported by its legislative history.

LaPalm and her child occupied the two bedrooms on the second floor of the apartment, and the victim occupied a bedroom in the basement.  The victim sold cocaine and marijuana, and she kept large sums of money in various denominations in a small keyed strongbox in the basement.', 'Sometime after 9 p.m. on March 22, 2010, LaPalm, the child, and the victim were in the kitchen of their apartment when a masked African-American man carrying a gun entered the home.  The intruder was dressed in black and wore a ski mask covering his face; he was approximately six feet tall and slim.', 'The victim pulled down the intruder\'s mask, exposing part of his face, and said,  ""What is this a joke?  We went to school together.""  In response, the intruder pointed the gun at LaPalm\'s child and said, ""This shit is serious.  Your [child]\'s right there.""  He then fired a', 'Page 802', 'bullet into the kitchen floor.', ""LaPalm immediately picked up her child and ran out the back door to her neighbor's apartment, where she telephoned 911.  As LaPalm ran, she looked back into her kitchen and saw the victim struggling with the intruder, who was dragging the victim toward the basement.  LaPalm also saw a second man standing at the foot of the stairs outside her apartment.  He was approximately five feet, six inches tall, was dressed in black, and was wearing a ski mask."", 'As LaPalm fled, a neighbor, Charles Brown, was arriving home.  He pulled into his driveway, saw LaPalm banging on his front door, and heard her ""screaming,"" ""There [are] two masked guys in my house.""  Moments later, Brown saw two men wearing masks and dressed in all black leave LaPalm\'s apartment.  One of the men was shorter than the other, approximately five feet, six inches tall; the other was over six feet tall and thin.  The two men ran past Brown\'s motor vehicle toward a light colored minivan.  One of the men was carrying a black box.  Although he was unable to see either perpetrator\'s face, Brown believed that he saw the hands of both men and concluded that they were African-American.', ""LaPalm also watched the masked men run through the parking lot.  She noticed that the taller intruder was carrying the victim's strongbox.  LaPalm then returned to her apartment, where she found the victim in the basement, curled up in a fetal position and moaning.  The victim had suffered two gunshot wounds, one to the front of her left thigh and one to the back of her head.  Gunshot residue indicated that the muzzle of the gun had been pressed near or against the victim's head when she was shot.  The murder weapon was not recovered."", 'Officers who responded to the scene that evening learned from college students who lived in a house next to the apartment complex that, at about 9:15 p.m., one of them saw two African-American men walking out of his backyard.  One of the men was about six feet, three inches tall and weighed over 200 pounds.  The other was approximately five feet, nine inches tall and skinny.  Both men appeared to be between eighteen and twenty-four years old and were wearing black hooded sweatshirts and black winter hats.  He asked the two men, ""What\'s going on?""  The taller man responded, ""We\'re hiding out in your backyard.""  The witness went back inside and told his two roommates what he had observed, and they all went outside.  From the front porch', 'Page 803', 'they observed two African-American men walking towards LaPalm\'s apartment complex.  When one of the students asked the two men what they were doing, the taller man responded, ""Do you have a problem?""  The three said, ""No,"" and went back inside their house.', ""In addition, an officer spoke with a woman and her young teenaged daughter, who lived in a house down the street from LaPalm's apartment complex.  The woman said that as she and her daughter left their house shortly after 9 p.m. to go grocery shopping, she noticed a gray minivan she did not recognize from the neighborhood parked directly in front of her driveway.  She also did not recognize either of the vehicle's two occupants, both of whom were wearing black hooded sweatshirts.  After she saw the two men leave the vehicle and run into her neighbor's backyard, the woman instructed her daughter to write down the vehicle's registration number on a piece of paper.  She also noticed white lettering on the top of the vehicle's windshield."", 'As a result, an officer issued a radio broadcast that police officers should be on the lookout for a minivan with the registration number that the woman had provided.

The witnesses were instructed that they were not to discuss the identification procedures or the results with other witnesses.  They were also instructed that it was just as important to clear an innocent person as it was to identify a guilty one, and that the individuals they were about to see may or may not be wearing the same clothing as they were wearing earlier that evening."", ""Each witness was then separately driven to where the minivan was parked and illuminated by the headlights of a police cruiser.  After each witness arrived, the defendant was escorted out from the back of a police cruiser and stood in front of the transport vehicle so that the vehicle's headlights would illuminate the defendant.  The defendant's hands were cuffed behind his back and an officer with a flashlight stood on either side of the defendant to illuminate his face.  The same process was repeated with the defendant's brother."", ""All three of the witnesses who had seen the perpetrators' vehicle earlier that evening -- Brown and the woman and her daughter -- positively identified the minivan that the defendant had been driving as the same vehicle they had seen earlier that evening, with the woman pointing out the lettering on the windshield she had seen earlier.

Defense counsel did not, however, notify the prosecutor that he had provided the incorrect booking videotape.  Instead, defense counsel made a strategic decision to offer the incorrect booking videotape at trial to reinforce his Bowden defense.  Specifically, defense counsel intended to play the recording to show that police had turned over the wrong videotape, that the defendant did not have blood on his T-shirt when he first arrived at the police"", 'Page 811', ""station, and that the victim's blood was transferred to the defendant's T-shirt through contact with the booking desk.

Id.', ""We assume, without deciding, that cases addressing lost or destroyed evidence apply here because the Commonwealth failed to provide a videotape it claimed to have provided before trial, and that the defendant satisfied his initial burden of establishing a reasonable possibility that access to the videotape recording would have produced favorable evidence.  We conclude that the Commonwealth exhibited no bad faith and, even if the Commonwealth had been negligent in failing to preserve the recording, the defendant was afforded a sufficient opportunity to remedy any prejudice.  The defendant was allowed, through cross-examination of police witnesses, to elicit testimony about the absence of visible blood stains on the defendant's T-shirt.  This was sufficient to remedy any prejudice to the defendant.  See Commonwealth v.

Although one-on-one showup identification', 'Page 812', 'procedures are ""generally disfavored as inherently suggestive,"" Commonwealth v. Dew,', ', 306 (2017), they only raise due process concerns if it is determined that the procedure was unnecessarily or impermissibly suggestive.  See Commonwealth v.

The crime involved an armed home invasion and homicide.  The police had not located the firearm and the perpetrators were still at large.  See Meas, 467 Mass. at 441 (""very good justification"" for showup where firearm not recovered at scene).  The showup took place within three hours of the shooting, see Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 218  (""good reason"" for showup two and one-half hours after shooting to determine whether shooter was still at large); Bowden, 379 Mass. at 479 (showup identification conducted two hours after murder admissible), and there were no ""special elements of unfairness, indicating a desire on the part of the police to \'stack the deck\' against the defendant,"" Dew, 478 Mass. at 307, quoting Commonwealth v.

Because defense counsel did not renew his objection at trial, it was not preserved."", '', ""At the suppression hearing, Brown testified that based on his observations of the perpetrators' hands, he believed the two men were African-American."", 'During his testimony before the grand jury, Brown testified, contrary to his testimony at the suppression hearing, that on the night he gave his statement to police, he was ""under a lot of . . . stress,"" and that he was no longer sure whether he had seen the shorter man\'s hands.', ""The defendant makes two arguments related to the admission of transcripts of Brown's testimony.  First, the defendant contends that Brown's testimony was not admissible because it does not fall within the prior recorded testimony exception to the rule against hearsay and that its introduction violated the defendant's confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Second, the defendant argues that suppression counsel rendered deficient performance by not impeaching"", 'Page 814', 'Brown with his prior grand jury testimony.', 'a.  Admissibility of Brown\'s prior recorded testimony.  ""We need not decide the admissibility of [Brown\'s] testimony as prior recorded testimony under our common law rule.  If the standards of the confrontation clause are met in the admission of [Brown\'s] testimony, the interests of justice test applied under G. L. c. 278, §?33E, is also met.""  Commonwealth v. Trigones,', ', 638 (1986).  As a result, ""we review the admission of the prior recorded testimony only to determine whether it offends the defendant\'s confrontation rights."" Caruso,', ', 293 (2017).', 'The admission of prior testimony does not violate the defendant\'s confrontation rights ""when the declarant is unavailable, as a matter of law, to testify and \'the defendant has had an adequate prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\'""  Caruso, 476 Mass. at 293, quoting Commonwealth v. Hurley,', ', 60 (2009).  An adequate prior opportunity means effective cross-examination at a prior proceeding addressed to ""substantially the same interests"" where the defendant had a ""similar motive"" to cross-examine the witness.  Caruso, supra.   It does not mean cross-examination that is ""effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.""  Id., quoting Hurley, supra at 62.  See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 57-59 (2004).

Commonwealth v. Sena,', ', 833 (2004).', ""Here, the issues at trial and the defendant's motive on cross-examination at the suppression hearing were sufficiently similar to satisfy the confrontation clause.  Brown's testimony at the suppression hearing dealt with the same underlying events -- Brown's observations of the perpetrators and the vehicle on the night of the killing -- and his testimony was admitted at the defendant's trial for that very same purpose.

Hudson, supra, quoting Fisher, supra.', ""Here, suppression counsel should have cross-examined Brown with inconsistencies between his testimony before the grand jury and at the suppression hearing.  We are confident, nonetheless, that suppression counsel's failure to do so had no bearing on the outcome of the case.  The inconsistencies were not material, because the record contains an abundance of evidence with identifications of both the defendant and the vehicle he was driving that night; these instances include identification of the vehicle the defendant had been driving by the mother and her daughter and, more importantly, the positive identification of the defendant by two of the college students at the showup."", ""5.  Motion for new trial.  The defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in a number of respects, and that the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, abused his discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial that raised these claims.  Specifically, the defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for (i) failing to consent to the nolle prosequi of the marijuana possession charge, and (ii) failing to call a blood spatter expert at trial.  The defendant also argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial because of newly discovered evidence of video technology that was not available at the time of the defendant's trial."", 'Because the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, ""[r]ather than evaluating an ineffective assistance claim under the traditional standard of Commonwealth v.

The defendant was indicted on charges of possession of a class D substance (marijuana) with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, § 32C (a).  Before trial, the Commonwealth sought to enter a nolle prosequi on that charge, but defense counsel refused.', ""Subsequently, trial counsel used the possession charge to explain the defendant's inculpatory statement to police, as well as his possession of marijuana, a scale, and $1,610 in various denominations.  The charge was nol prossed after the close of evidence, but before closing arguments."", 'The defendant now contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to consent to the nolle prosequi, failing to challenge the indictment on the grounds that Sonja Farak was the confirmatory chemist,', ""and putting evidence of the defendant's drug dealing activities before the jury."", ""The defendant has not shown that his trial counsel's tactical decision was manifestly unreasonable.  To the contrary, this situation presents a textbook example of a reasonable strategic concession.  Within minutes of apprehension, the defendant made a statement to police that seemingly implicated himself in the shooting.  Based on the defendant's statement to police, it was a reasonable strategy at trial to justify those statements by suggesting that the defendant was referring to another criminal offense that, when compared to those before the jury, was seemingly innocuous.  Moreover, this strategy provided the jury with a possible explanation -- apart from the inference that these items had been secured in the strongbox that had been stolen from the"", 'Page 817', ""victim's bedroom -- for the defendant's possession of marijuana, a digital scale, and $1,610 in various denominations.  The challenge trial counsel faced was not potential prejudice because the defendant may have sold marijuana, but overwhelming circumstantial evidence of guilt in the murder along with compelling DNA evidence and the defendant's inculpatory statement.  Although not entirely without risk, this strategy was not manifestly unreasonable.  See Commonwealth v. Vardinski,"", ', 455 (2003); Commonwealth v. White,', ', 277 (1991).  Accordingly, we discern no error.', 'ii.  Failure to call expert witness.  The defendant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to offer at trial the testimony of a blood spatter expert.  The defendant asserts that a blood spatter expert could have explained that the blood stain on the defendant\'s T-shirt was a transfer stain.  He further contends that an expert should have been called to explain the significance of the absence of gunshot residue on the defendant\'s hands.  Although the defendant offered the curriculum vitae of a blood spatter expert, the defendant has not submitted an affidavit from that expert describing the testimony that he would have offered if called to testify.  A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel ""for failure to call an expert witness is generally doomed where \'[t]he defendant\'s claim is not supported by any affidavits\' to disclose the content of the omitted expert testimony"" (citation omitted).  Alicea, 464 Mass. at 850-851.  Through cross-examination of the Commonwealth\'s experts, trial counsel elicited evidence that the bloodstains on the defendant\'s T-shirt could not be classified as spatter stains, thereby providing support for the defendant\'s theory that the bloodstains on the defendant\'s T-shirt were transfer stains.  See Commonwealth v. Seino,', ', 474 n.18 (2018) (ineffective assistance claim fails where defense counsel, through cross-examination of Commonwealth\'s experts, ""elicited evidence to support the defense\'s theory of how the defendant\'s blood was transferred to the victim"").

Finally, the defendant argues that we should exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, § 33E, to order a new trial or reduce the murder verdict for various reasons.  The defendant contends that he is entitled to relief based on (1) insufficient ""physical evidence"" connecting the defendant to the crime; (2) misconduct by members of the Springfield police department; (3) the judge\'s failure to apply the correct standard in ruling on the defendant\'s motion for a new trial; (4) credibility issues involving the Commonwealth\'s key witness; and (5) the exclusion of portions of the police audio recording in contravention of the doctrine of verbal completeness.', '""When we undertake review under [G.

For example, the defendant argues that he is entitled to relief because LaPalm, the Commonwealth\'s key witness, ""was a drug addict.""

See Commonwealth v. Rakes,"", ', 32 (2017) (""A conviction may rest exclusively on circumstantial evidence"").

The Commonwealth asserted that it was privileged not to disclose the information, see Commonwealth v. Bonnett,', ', 846-847 (2015), because disclosure would jeopardize the informant\'s safety.  It averred that the informant was not a percipient witness to the juvenile\'s arrest, and that the juvenile had not met his burden of demonstrating that disclosure was required.  After a hearing, the judge allowed the juvenile\'s motion.  The judge determined that the Commonwealth properly had asserted an informant privilege, and that the juvenile adequately had challenged the assertion of the privilege on the ground that it interfered with his right to present a defense.  See id. at 846.  The judge concluded that the ""informant\'s identity and concomitant information are sufficiently \'relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused\' that it must be disclosed.""

Bonnett, 472 Mass. at 846.  See Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 274 (1995).  The determination whether the information may remain confidential occurs in a two-stage process.  See Bonnett, supra.  At the preliminary stage, the trial judge first evaluates whether the Commonwealth properly invoked the privilege.  Id. at 846-847 (privilege may be asserted ""only where disclosure would endanger the informant or otherwise impede law enforcement efforts"").  According to the judge\'s findings in this case, when the juvenile was apprehended, he was in the company of another person.  Both the juvenile and the other person were identified as being involved with gang activity.  The other person had a ""long history of convictions,"" as well as a pending firearm case.  The Commonwealth alleged that disclosure of the identity of the informant would endanger that person.  On these facts, the judge was warranted in concluding that the Commonwealth properly invoked its privilege.  Bonnett, supra at 845.', 'Page 1006', ""The preliminary stage of the analysis has a second part, however.  As to that part, as well as at the second stage, the judge's analysis was flawed:  the judge failed to evaluate the juvenile's need for disclosure in the context of a preliminary hearing, as opposed to at the trial itself.  See Commonwealth v. Amral,"", ', 518 (1990).  With respect to the second part of the preliminary stage, a defendant is required to request that the Commonwealth\'s privilege be set aside, because it ""interferes with a fair defence.""  Bonnett, 472 Mass. at 847, quoting Commonwealth v. Johnson,', ', 544 (1974), S.C.,', '(1977).  We have characterized a defendant\'s obligation at this juncture as ""relatively undemanding,"" Bonnett, supra, but it does require the defendant to articulate a basis sufficient for the judge to ""assess the materiality and relevancy of the disclosure to the defense, if that relevancy is not apparent from the nature of the case.""  Id., quoting Commonwealth v. Kelsey,', ', 323 (2013).  Although the judge concluded that the juvenile had satisfied that standard, he failed to recognize that the standards of disclosure are more demanding where, as here, the disclosure is sought for pretrial purposes.  See Hernandez, 421 Mass. at 275; Commonwealth v. Lugo,', ', 574 (1990).', 'Likewise, at the second stage of the analysis, it was the judge\'s obligation to determine whether the ""informant\'s identity and concomitant information are sufficiently \'relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused\'"" to require disclosure (citation omitted).  Bonnett, 472 Mass. at 847.  Again, in making the determination that the Commonwealth\'s privilege should give way, the judge failed to distinguish between ""the need for disclosure at a pretrial suppression hearing and at the trial proper.""  Lugo, 406 Mass. at 570-571 (""nondisclosure is rather readily countenanced at pre-trial hearings, but not so at the trial itself"").  See Commonwealth v. Madigan,', ', 706 n.8 (2007), quoting Commonwealth v. Snyder,', ', 532 (1992) (""[n]ondisclosure of a source of information that bears on a preliminary question, such as the suppression of evidence, \'is more readily tolerated than the nondisclosure at trial of a source of evidence, where guilt or innocence is directly involved\'""); Snyder, supra (mere possibility that disclosure of informant identity might be helpful on preliminary question, such as suppression of evidence, not sufficient to require disclosure); Amral, 407 Mass. at 517-518.', 'The distinction between ""a demand for disclosure at a pretrial hearing, where the issue is probable cause for arrest or search, and a demand for disclosure at trial, where the issue is the defendant\'s ultimate guilt or innocence,"" is an important one that long has been maintained.  See Madigan, 449 Mass. at 706 n.8.  Because the judge\'s analysis conflated the two standards, and in light of the two important but distinct public policies at issue, the analytical error should not stand.  See Commonwealth v.

Although she did not witness the shooting, she testified that she observed a red Taurus motor vehicle ""skidding off"" from the scene immediately after the shooting.', 'The jury eventually returned guilty verdicts on all three charges, and the defendant was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  The defendant now appeals.\r\n\r\n\tDiscussion.  1.  Sufficiency of the evidence.  On appeal, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence proving that he was the shooter.  In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply the familiar Latimore standard.  See Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 677-678 (1979).  We consider whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id.  The evidence may be direct or circumstantial, and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Commonwealth.  Commonwealth v. Rakes,', ', 32 (2017).  A conviction cannot stand, however, if it is based entirely on conjecture or speculation.  Id.', 'At trial, the Commonwealth primarily relied on the eyewitness testimony of Perez to prove that the defendant was the shooter.  The defendant argues, however, that this testimony cannot be used to support his convictions because the jury were incapable of assessing its reliability.  The defendant\'s challenge centers on Perez\'s testimony that he was able to identify the defendant as the shooter because the muzzle flash from the gun ""illuminated"" the defendant\'s face.  The defendant argues that because the illuminating capability of a muzzle flash is not within the ordinary, common experience of a reasonable juror, the jury could not have found that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt, without speculation, that the defendant was the shooter.', 'Even assuming, as the defendant argues, that ordinary jurors are unfamiliar with the illuminating capability of muzzle flashes, there was independent evidence that would permit a rational juror to reasonably infer that the crime scene was sufficiently illuminated at the time of the shooting to provide Perez with the opportunity to identify the defendant as the shooter.', 'Page 52', 'Evidence at trial established that the shooting took place near a street light located on the sidewalk in front of the property adjacent to the house.', 'A police officer testified that the street lights near the location of the shooting and the exterior lights on a nearby building were illuminated when he arrived at the crime scene at approximately 4:30 a.m.', 'Although there was no evidence whether the specific street light near where the shooter was standing was on at the time of the shooting, a juror could reasonably have inferred that if the street lights in the area were on at 4:30 a.m., they would have also been on at the time of the shooting earlier in the morning.', 'Even if an ordinary, rational juror is unfamiliar with muzzle flashes, they are undoubtedly familiar with the illuminating capability of street lights.  This common knowledge would have allowed a rational juror to conclude that Perez had an adequate opportunity to identify the defendant as the shooter.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Stewart,', ', 28, 33 (2007) (evidence sufficient to prove defendant was shooter based, in part, on eyewitness seeing defendant shoot while standing in front of street light).', ""In addition to the presence of the street light, the jury received other evidence that would have allowed them to assess the reliability of Perez's identification.  For example, the jury heard testimony that Perez had observed the defendant for several minutes earlier in the morning while he was in the stairwell.  They also heard testimony that Perez recognized the defendant walking on the street from the second-floor porch after the defendant was kicked out of the party.  Additionally, evidence showed that Perez successfully identified the defendant from a photographic array at the police station after the shooting.  This evidence would further have provided a rational juror with an adequate basis to assess the reliability of Perez's identification of the defendant at the time of"", 'Page 53', 'the shooting.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Richardson,', "", 249-251 & n.3, 255 (2014) (evidence sufficient where eyewitness identified defendant fleeing from police from over 200 feet away, selected defendant's photograph from photographic array at police station, and had seen defendant on two prior occasions)."", 'The Commonwealth also presented circumstantial evidence linking the defendant to the shooting.  For example, prior to the shooting, the defendant arrived at the party and refused to be searched.  He was visibly upset that there was a party taking place at the house, and after being kicked out, he threatened to come back to the party and ""light th[e] place up.""  Soon after, he returned and kicked in the first-floor door with such force that he left a footprint on the door.  Additionally, the defendant was seen pacing around on the street in front of the house just a few minutes before Perez and Ramkissoon left the party and the shooting took place.  From this evidence, the jury could have reasonably inferred that the defendant did not want to be searched on the morning of June 10 because he was carrying a gun, that he was still near the house when the shooting occurred, and that his anger about the party motivated him to shoot Ramkissoon as he crossed the street.  This evidence, when taken together, ""formed a mosaic of evidence such that the jury could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was the shooter"" (quotation and citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Jones,', ', 317 (2017).  Cf. id. at 316-318 (sufficient evidence that defendant was shooter where evidence linking him to shooting was that he generally matched description of person seen fleeing crime scene, he was at park where crime occurred that day, he grew up in area and regularly visited park, and he lied to police about his whereabouts that day).', ""We therefore conclude that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and taken together with the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, was sufficient to support the jury's verdict that defendant was the one who shot and killed the victim.  See Latimore, 378 Mass. at 677-678."", ""2.  Dual sovereignty.  The defendant also argues that his due process rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights were violated by (i) the Commonwealth's failure to obtain and turn over discovery related to the sole defense witness's status as a confidential informant, and (ii) the judge's decisions declining to compel various State and Federal law"", 'Page 54', ""enforcement officers to testify to the defense witness's status as a confidential informant.  Because we conclude that the informant records and sought-after testimony were not in the possession or control of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth did not have the burden to secure the Federal government's cooperation with regard to the disclosure of this information, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying and quashing the defendant's various motions and subpoenas."", 'a.  Relevant facts.  Shortly before the trial was originally scheduled to begin in July 2008, the Commonwealth informed defense counsel that it had recently learned that a witness likely to be called by the defense, N.F., was a confidential informant for a Federal gang task force operating in Springfield.', 'As a result of this new information, the trial was continued several times until over one year later in August 2009.', ""The Commonwealth's disclosure resulted in multiple motions by the defendant to obtain Federal records detailing N.F.'s status as a confidential informant (informant records) and to compel the testimony of Federal agents regarding the same through State court proceedings."", ""The defendant argued that the information was material to his defense because it was necessary to demonstrate N.F.'s credibility as a witness, which the defendant contended was exculpatory information.  At various times, the defendant was informed that a successful pursuit of this information"", 'Page 55', 'would require that he comply with the procedure set forth by Federal regulations.  The federally mandated procedure required the defendant to submit a written request for information describing the informant records and the subject matter of the testimony sought.  Federal authorities would then review the sought-after information for privilege, confidentiality, and the likelihood that its disclosure would compromise ongoing investigations.  After this review, the Federal authorities would report back to the defendant and either disclose the requested information or explain why it was continuing to be withheld.  Despite being made aware of the Federal procedure, the defendant refused to comply and continued to unsuccessfully request that the trial court judge compel Federal authorities to disclose this information.', ""During the time period of the continuance, and while engaging in the pursuit of the federally held information, the defense had the opportunity to depose N.F.  At her deposition, N.F. testified to her status as a confidential informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), including the nature of her work and compensation.  She also testified to her observations on the morning of the shooting, which supported the defendant's theory that he was not present at the scene at the time of the shooting.  Specifically, N.F. testified that she witnessed the defendant driving away from the scene before the shooting took place, and instead implicated another individual whom she witnessed fleeing the scene.  The deposition also revealed that N.F. had telephoned a Federal agent on or about the morning of the shooting and described what had occurred."", ""On the eve of trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case based on the Commonwealth's failure to turn over N.F.'s informant records.  The motion was eventually denied.  The defendant then sought once again to compel the testimony of a member of the Federal gang task force, but the subpoena was quashed.  Subpoenas for several other law enforcement officers and an assistant United States attorney were similarly quashed.  After these subpoenas had been quashed and the trial was set to begin, at the suggestion of the trial judge, the defendant finally submitted a request to Federal authorities for the informant records in compliance with the governing Federal regulations described above.  Redacted copies of these records were disclosed to the defendant a few days later, before the defense had rested its case.  These records effectively confirmed N.F's status as a confidential Federal informant and included a summary of a statement"", 'Page 56', 'made by N.F. to a Federal law enforcement officer regarding the shooting.  The Federal government also authorized two law enforcement officers to testify on a limited basis.', 'b.  Analysis.  The due process clauses of the Federal Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights require that the Commonwealth disclose material, exculpatory evidence to the defendant.', 'Committee for Pub. Counsel Servs. v. Attorney Gen.,', ', 731 (2018).  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963); Commonwealth v. Donahue,', ', 596 (1986).  This obligation, however, is ""limited to that [information] in the possession of the prosecutor or police"" (citation omitted).  Donahue, supra (""The prosecutor cannot be said to suppress that which is not in his possession or subject to his control"").', ""The information related to N.F.'s status as a confidential informant was not in the Commonwealth's possession or control, but rather was in the possession and control of the Federal government.  There is no contention, nor is there any evidence, that any member of the Federal government or the Federal gang task force assisted in the investigation or prosecution of the defendant's case.  The records held by the task force therefore cannot be said to have been in the possession or control of the Commonwealth.  See Commonwealth v. Beal,"", ', 532 (1999).  The Commonwealth was therefore under no obligation to turn over this information.  See id. (""The prosecutor\'s duty does not extend beyond information held by agents of the prosecution team""); Donahue, 396 Mass. at 596-597.', 'Although we do not charge the Commonwealth with the obligation to disclose exculpatory information that it does not possess or control, we have recognized that issues of Federal and State sovereignty have the potential to prejudice a defendant being prosecuted in State court by stymying his or her ability to obtain exculpatory information held by Federal authorities.  Donahue, 396 Mass. at 598.  See Commonwealth v. Liebman,', ', 674 (1980), S.C.,', '(1983).  Accordingly, under', 'Page 57', 'certain circumstances we will require the Commonwealth to bear the burden of securing the cooperation of the Federal government with regard to the disclosure of exculpatory information.  Donahue, supra.  See Commonwealth v. Lykus,', ', 327 (2008); Liebman, supra at 675.  Imposing this burden serves to guard against any potential unfairness to a defendant that may arise due to the presence of two sovereigns.  See Lykus, supra at 328; Liebman, supra at 674.', 'A determination whether the Commonwealth bears this burden requires us to apply the four-factor analysis set forth in Donahue, 396 Mass. at 599.  We evaluate ""[(i)] the potential unfairness to the defendant; [(ii)] the defendant\'s lack of access to the evidence; [(iii)] the burden on the prosecutor of obtaining the evidence; and [(iv)] the degree of cooperation between State and Federal authorities, both in general and in the particular case.""  Id.  Applying the above analysis to this case, we conclude that each factor weighs against imposing the burden on the Commonwealth to secure the release of information related to N.F.\'s status as a confidential Federal informant.', ""Under the first Donahue factor, we discern no unfairness to the defendant as a result of not receiving this information.  Cf. Donahue, 396 Mass. at 599-600.  As a threshold matter, we note that N.F.'s status as an informant was not withheld or otherwise hidden from the defendant in any way.  The Commonwealth disclosed her status to the defendant, and defense counsel had the opportunity to depose N.F. to uncover the full nature of her relationship with the FBI.  The defendant sought the informant records and corroborative testimony from Federal officers, however, for the sole purpose of establishing N.F.'s credibility as a witness in front of the jury.  At trial, the judge permitted the defendant to admit N.F.'s status in evidence through her testimony.  That status was not in any way contested.  The judge ruled that he would not permit any additional evidence -- whether through documents or additional testimony -- detailing her work as an informant that would amount to vouching for her credibility.  See United States v. Piva, 870 F.2d 753, 760 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting inappropriateness of use of government officials to vouch for credibility of their informants because evaluation of informant's credibility is up to jury).  On direct examination, N.F. testified that she was indeed an informant and that she had worked as an informant for approximately two years and had been paid by Federal authorities on multiple occasions.  N.F. also testified"", 'Page 58', ""extensively about her observations on the morning of the shooting and forcefully denied any involvement by the defendant in the shooting.  Accordingly, the information the defense sought to use to establish N.F.'s status as an informant was cumulative of her uncontested testimony on this issue.\tThe cumulative nature of the information was confirmed on the last day of trial when a redacted copy of N.F.'s informant records was produced to the defendant.  The information contained in the unredacted portions of the records, at most, confirmed N.F.'s status as an informant and revealed a summary of the statement that she gave to a Federal agent concerning the shooting.  This information was fully developed during N.F.'s deposition and at trial.  Additionally, the officers whose testimony the defendant sought to compel were only authorized to testify on a limited basis and were not permitted to disclose the identities of confidential informants.  The only arguably new information contained in the disclosed records included a reference to a separate individual, whom she named, as the shooter.  This individual's alleged presence at the scene of the crime, however, was disclosed to the defense over one year earlier when the Commonwealth disclosed to the defendant that N.F. was an informant.  The potential involvement of a third party in the shooting was also revealed by N.F. during her deposition.  Despite this knowledge, defense counsel chose not to question N.F. about this individual's involvement during direct examination.  The remaining portions of the records were redacted pursuant to Federal guidelines.  To the extent that the defendant argues that he was entitled to the disclosure of the unredacted portions of the file, he is mistaken.  The defendant has not produced any evidence that the redacted portions of the file contained any relevant, let alone exculpatory, information.  See Commonwealth v. Healy,"", ', 679 (2003) (""To prevail on a claim that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, the defendant must first prove that the evidence was, in fact, exculpatory"").  The defendant was therefore not prejudiced by his inability to obtain this information before trial.  See Commonwealth v. Vieira,', ', 838 (1988) (no prejudice where substance of withheld evidence was cumulative of information already known to defendant).', ""On appeal, the defendant also argues that he was prejudiced by the failure to have this information at trial because it was needed to rehabilitate N.F.'s credibility after she contradicted her own testimony with regard to how long she was an informant."", 'Page 59', 'Specifically, after testifying on direct examination that she was an informant for at least two years and had been paid by the Federal government on multiple occasions, she testified on cross-examination that she had only been paid once.', ""This contradiction did not put her status as a confidential informant in doubt, however, just the length of time that she was an informant and on how many occasions she was paid by Federal authorities -- both issues tangential to the case.  We do not believe that the defendant's access to the Federal records and testimony on N.F.'s informant status was therefore necessary to rehabilitate her credibility for these purposes, and instead may have presented other problems for the defense.  Indeed, admitting additional evidence on the length of time that she was an informant after her testimony on cross-examination concluded may very well have further undermined her credibility.  The fairness concerns present in other cases involving issues of dual sovereignty are therefore not present here.  See, e.g., Donahue, 396 Mass. at 599-600."", ""The second Donahue factor considers the defendant's lack of access to the sought-after evidence.  Here, we conclude that this factor weighs heavily against imposing the burden on the Commonwealth to secure the disclosure of this information.  The defendant was given an opportunity to depose N.F prior to trial.  The record makes clear that the defendant also had ample time and opportunity to obtain the informant records and the substance of the sought-after testimony well before trial.  Approximately eleven months before trial took place, the defendant was advised that obtaining this information from Federal authorities would require that he pursue it in accordance with Federal regulations."", 'Page 60', 'Indeed, he was reminded of the federally mandated procedure described several times, including by this court.  See Ayala v. Commonwealth,', ', 1015 n.2 (2009) (noting that defendant ""may have other means at his disposal to obtain the information he seeks.  The Federal agencies have indicated that they would consider a request submitted by the defendant pursuant to [Federal regulations]"").  See also United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462, 468 (1951) (upholding Federal regulation restricting ability of Federal authorities to disclose subpoenaed information).  He did not, however, avail himself of the opportunity to obtain this information through the Federal procedure.  Instead, he engaged in a year-long campaign to compel this information through State proceedings.  The defendant had a full and fair opportunity to retrieve this evidence months before trial, but chose not to.  Indeed, when he finally did comply with the Federal procedures at the start of the trial, he received a redacted copy of N.F.\'s informant records and a notice authorizing the testimony of two Federal officers a few days later.', 'The third Donahue factor requires us to evaluate the burden on the prosecutor in obtaining the withheld information.  Under this factor, we consider whether the prosecutor has a means of access to the information held by Federal authorities that the defendant does not.  See Donahue, 396 Mass. at 600.  Here, the prosecutor would have been required to comply with the Federal procedure as well.', 'This case is therefore distinguishable from cases where the burden on the prosecution to retrieve the withheld information was minimal compared to the defendant.  See id. (noting that while exculpatory information could not be obtained by defendant, it ""may well have been available to the prosecutor on request"").  There is no evidence in this case that a request from the Commonwealth, rather than from the defendant, would have precipitated the disclosure of the evidence.  In fact, the record reveals the opposite.  In response to discovery requests issued by the defendant that sought to determine whether other individuals at the party were also Federal informants, the prosecutor submitted requests for information related to these individuals in compliance with the Federal regulations.  Rather than disclose this information, the FBI curtly informed the prosecutor that it ""decline[d] either to confirm or deny whether [an individual] is or', 'Page 61', 'was an informant for the FBI.""  The burden on the prosecution was thus comparable to that on the defendant.', 'The fourth and final Donahue factor considers the degree of cooperation between State and Federal authorities, both in general and in the particular case.  Where the cooperation between the two sovereigns is particularly strong, such as in a joint investigation of a defendant, we have determined that fairness dictates that the burden of securing the disclosure of the information held by Federal authorities falls squarely on the Commonwealth.  See Lykus, 451 Mass. at 328.  Here, however, there is no evidence of any cooperation between State and Federal authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the defendant\'s case.  Although there was evidence that several Springfield police officers were deputized as Federal officers for the purposes of operating within the Federal gang task force, there was nothing to suggest that these officers played any role in the defendant\'s case.  Because this case did not fall within the umbrella of matters under investigation by the task force, it cannot be said that the FBI ""functioned as [an] agent[]"" of the Commonwealth in this case.  Donahue, 396 Mass. at 599.', ""After weighing these factors, we conclude that the Commonwealth was not required to bear the burden of securing the release of the information concerning N.F.'s status as an informant from Federal authorities.  The defendant was not prejudiced by the nondisclosure, the defendant had ample opportunity to depose the informant and retrieve this information on his own, the Commonwealth would have been required to follow the same Federal procedures as the defendant to access the information, and the Federal government played no role in the investigation or prosecution of the defendant's case.  See Lykus, 451 Mass. at 328; Donahue, 396 Mass. at 598; Liebman, 379 Mass. at 675.  The trial judge therefore did not abuse his discretion in declining to require the Commonwealth to secure N.F.'s informant records from Federal authorities and in declining to compel the testimony of Federal law enforcement officers."", ""3.  Ineffective assistance of counsel.  Following his convictions, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that his trial counsel had been ineffective.  The motion advanced a litany of errors alleged to have been made by trial counsel.  Relevant to this appeal, the motion judge, who was not the trial judge, allowed an evidentiary hearing on trial counsel's failure to retain and call experts on eyewitness identification and ballistics.

Had an expert been called, the defendant argues, the jury would have heard evidence on the variables that affect eyewitness identifications and would have had ""further reason to doubt the reliability of Perez\'s identification.""  Specifically, the defendant claims that an eyewitness identification expert would have testified to the theory of ""transference,"" which suggests that Perez identified the defendant as the shooter only because of his earlier observations of the defendant during his altercation with the bouncers.  Additionally, the defendant contends that the expert would have testified to ""the negative effects on accuracy of heightened stress and post-identification feedback,"" the ""weak correlation of confidence to accuracy"" of the identification, and the ""chance of error by a single eyewitness.""', 'The decision to call, or not to call, an expert witness fits squarely within the realm of strategic or tactical decisions.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Facella,', ', 413 (2017) (decision not to call psychiatric expert reasonable strategic decision); Commonwealth v. Hensley,', ', 739 (2009) (decision not to call expert strategic).

At the evidentiary hearing, trial counsel testified that at the time of trial, he believed that N.F's testimony that the"", 'Page 64', 'defendant was not at the scene at the time of the shooting, the inconsistencies of Perez\'s eyewitness account, and Perez\'s mental health struggles would be sufficient to challenge the reliability of Perez\'s identification.  To that end, trial counsel attacked Perez\'s identification of the defendant as the shooter, both on cross-examination and during closing argument.  On cross-examination, trial counsel confronted Perez on his ability to accurately identify the shooter under the lighting conditions at the time of the shooting, his recollection of certain events that morning, and the discrepancies between Perez\'s statement to police on the morning of the shooting and his trial testimony regarding the defendant\'s height and clothing worn.  Additionally, the defense presented evidence that Perez suffered from PTSD as a result of his military service and bipolar disorder.  Specifically, trial counsel introduced evidence that Perez had sought counselling for his mental health struggles approximately 161 times over an eight-year period and that he began taking medication for these issues a few months after the shooting.  Finally, during closing argument, trial counsel argued that Perez\'s identification was unreliable.  He argued that in light of Perez\'s mental health struggles, the ""collective experience"" of the jurors could lead them to conclude that ""those are difficult illnesses and they may impact his ability to see and conceptualize what was actually happening.""  He also argued that Perez had made a mistaken identification.', ""The reliability of Perez's identification was vigorously challenged through this strategy."", 'Cf. Commonwealth v. Watson,', ', 257-259 (2009) (decision not to seek funds for expert on eyewitness identification not manifestly unreasonable where', 'Page 65', 'reliability of identification challenged on cross-examination and in closing argument).

Ballistics expert.  The defendant also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a ballistics expert who would testify that a muzzle flash fired from a semiautomatic handgun was unlikely to provide sufficient illumination to allow an individual to adequately see the face of the shooter.  We need not decide whether the decision not to call a ballistics expert was a manifestly unreasonable one because, even assuming that it was, we conclude that it was not likely to have influenced the jury's conclusion.  See Seino, 479 Mass. at 472-473."", 'As we discussed in depth supra, there was a significant amount of independent evidence establishing that the crime scene was illuminated at the time of the shooting.  For example, a police officer testified that the street lights near the location of the shooting and the exterior lights on a nearby building were illuminated when he arrived at the crime scene at approximately 4:30 a.m. -- only approximately one and one-half to two hours after the shooting occurred.  Additionally, the jury heard evidence that suggested the area in front of the home was illuminated enough to permit N.F. and Perez to independently identify the defendant from the porch on the second floor while the defendant was standing on the street outside.  Even assuming that an expert would have testified that Perez was unlikely to have been able to see the shooter solely from the muzzle flash, the jury were not likely to have been influenced by this testimony in light of the other evidence that the crime scene was lit at the time of the shooting.  Accordingly, we conclude that any error in failing to call a ballistics expert did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.', 'c.

Finally, the defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to notice that certain psychological records detailing', 'Page 66', 'Perez\'s history of mental health struggles and drug use mistakenly had been withheld despite a court order compelling their disclosure.  Without these records, the defendant argues, trial counsel was unable to explore the full extent of how Perez\'s mental health and drug use could have affected his ""ability to accurately perceive and identify the shooter.""  The motion judge denied the defendant\'s motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing on this argument.  He concluded that because these issues were sufficiently before the jury, the additional records would not have ""added to the information already at [trial counsel\'s] disposal and used in cross-examination at trial.""  We agree.', 'As discussed supra, Perez\'s PTSD and bipolar disorder diagnoses were both brought out on cross-examination at trial.  Specifically, Perez testified that he had been diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder, that he received counselling and medication to treat the diagnoses, and that he had had a counselling session on the day after the murder.  He further testified that over the period of approximately eight years following his discharge from the military, he had sought counselling for his PTSD 161 times and that he suffered from ""night terror[s]"" and sleeplessness as a result of his PTSD.', 'Additionally, he testified that he used marijuana to cope with the effects of his PTSD diagnosis.', 'Notably, there was no evidence -- either introduced at trial or contained within the missing records -- that suggests that Perez\'s mental health struggles or drug use affected his ability to perceive the defendant on the morning of the shooting.  For example, a defense expert\'s proffered testimony only acknowledged that Perez\'s mental health struggles ""had the potential to and may have interfered with Mr. Perez\'s abilities to accurately perceive or recollect the [shooting].""  Trial counsel argued this point specifically during closing, stating that Perez\'s diagnoses ""are difficult illnesses and they may impact his ability to see and conceptualize what was actually happening.""  Additionally, although the missing records suggested that Perez was more dependent on marijuana', 'Page 67', ""than his testimony let on, there was no evidence that he was under the influence of marijuana on the morning of the shooting.  The defendant's proffered expert on this point would not have materially added to the defense, as he was prepared only to testify that individuals have a reduced ability to accurately perceive reality and recall past events while under the influence of mind-altering substances.

In May, 2016, J.D. discovered a GPS device attached to the undercarriage of his wife's vehicle and reported the discovery to the Hingham police department.  J.D. was concerned because he could not think of anyone who would be monitoring his or his wife's location.  The police took the GPS device and advised J.D. to check his own vehicle for a similar device.  Upon returning home, J.D. discovered a second GPS device on his vehicle where the spare tire would be located."", 'The following day, police interviewed J.D. and J.H. at length, together and separately.  Police questioned the couple about their finances, careers, and potential infidelity.  No information, however, was gathered as to who attached the GPS devices to their vehicles.', ""The police contacted the manufacturer of the GPS device, Brickhouse Security (Brickhouse), but were unable to obtain the corresponding customer information.  Because J.D. was a member of the United States Coast Guard, he reported the event to Special Agent Jeremy Baldwin of the United States Coast Guard's investigative service.  Baldwin obtained a subpoena to gather information from Brickhouse.  Brickhouse informed him that the defendant was the owner of the GPS devices and that the GPS devices were shipped to the defendant in December 2015."", 'Baldwin and the police then interviewed the defendant.  At first,', 'Page 148', 'he denied any knowledge of who placed the GPS devices on J.D. and J.H.\'s vehicles.

The defendant refused to provide the name of the person he alleged was having sexual relations with J.D.', ""Eventually, the defendant admitted that he had an account with Brickhouse and that he was monitoring the movements of the couple's vehicles using the GPS devices, which he accessed with his Apple iPhone"", 'and laptop computer.', ""Police searched the defendant's iPhone pursuant to a warrant and created a forensic extraction report.  The defendant's Internet history included visits to Brickhouse's online log-in page, J.D.'s Twitter social media page, and fifty-three Internet mapping program searches of various latitude and longitude coordinates gathered from the GPS devices.  Baldwin subpoenaed the Brickhouse account information and received a full history report for each device.  The history reports provided detailed location information about each device."", ""Baldwin also discovered that the defendant purchased a third GPS device in April, approximately one month before J.D. discovered the two GPS devices.  Using the forensic data from the defendant's iPhone, the police confirmed seventeen separate instances in which the defendant researched the locations of the vehicles over the course of ten days in May 2016."", ""After interviewing the defendant, the police and Coast Guard interviewed J.D. again and informed him of the defendant's"", 'Page 149', 'accusations that he was having an affair.

We are in as good a position as a motion judge to assess the evidence submitted in support of the application for a criminal complaint, and we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth without deference to the motion judge's factual findings or legal conclusions.  Commonwealth v. Silva,"", ', 526 (2009).', '3.  Discussion.  To support the complaint for criminal harassment, the Commonwealth must show that there is probable cause that ""(1) the defendant engaged in a knowing pattern of conduct', 'Page 150', 'or speech, or series of acts, on at least three separate occasions; (2) the defendant intended to target the victim with the harassing conduct . . . on each occasion; (3) the conduct . . . [was] of such a nature that [it] seriously alarmed the victim; (4) the conduct . . . [was] of such a nature that [it] would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress; and (5) the defendant committed the conduct . . . \'willfully and maliciously.\'""  Commonwealth v. McDonald,', ', 240 (2012), quoting Commonwealth v. Kulesa,', ', 452 (2009).  See G. L. c. 265, § 43A.  The Commonwealth argues that the complaint overcomes the low threshold required to show that there was probable cause that the defendant committed two counts of criminal harassment.  The defendant maintains that there is no probable cause to support four of the five elements of criminal harassment:  (1) the complaint does not allege three qualifying acts; (2) he did not intend to target J.D. or J.H. with harassing conduct; (3) the conduct would not cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress; and (4) the conduct was not committed willfully and maliciously.', ""a.  Three acts targeted at J.D. and J.H.  According to the defendant, the complaint does not establish three qualifying acts of criminal harassment against either J.D. or J.H.  We conclude that there was probable cause that the defendant committed at least three separate acts targeted at J.D. and J.H. when he concealed the GPS device on J.D.'s vehicle, concealed the GPS device on J.H.'s vehicle, and then tracked the movements of the GPS devices from his iPhone."", 'The defendant contends that placing GPS tracking devices on the couple\'s vehicles does not qualify as an ""act"" under § 43A because there is no law that criminalizes such conduct by a private person.  The defendant\'s argument is unavailing.  A defendant\'s otherwise legal conduct may qualify as an act of harassment when considered with other evidence.  See McDonald, 462 Mass. at 245.  In addition to concealing the GPS devices, the defendant commented to the police that J.D. was ""stepping out"" on his wife and that the defendant was ""guarding the hen house.""  Making matters worse, the defendant admits that he had never had any interaction with either J.D. or J.H. before.  Viewing the evidence in this context and in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we conclude that the act of concealing a GPS device on an individual\'s vehicle qualifies as an ""act"" within § 43A.', 'Page 151', 'The defendant maintains, however, that even if placing the GPS devices does qualify as an ""act"" within § 43A, it is only one act against J.D., placing the GPS on his car, and one act against J.H., placing the GPS on her car.  The defendant correctly points out that G. L. c. 265, § 43A (a), ""requires that the Commonwealth prove three or more predicate acts of harassment that were \'directed at a specific person.\'""  Commonwealth v. Johnson,', ', 312 (2014), quoting McDonald, 462 Mass. at 240.  He claims that the complaint does not provide evidence that his attention was directed specifically at J.D. or J.H.  We disagree.', ""The information in the complaint is enough to warrant a reasonable person to conclude that the defendant's harassing conduct was targeted at J.D. and J.H.  See generally Johnson, 470 Mass. at 312\x96313 (acts of harassment can be directed simultaneously at more than one person).  Contrast Commonwealth v. Welch,"", "", 92 (2005), abrogated on another ground, O'Brien v. Borowski,"", ""(2012) (Commonwealth did not establish that defendant's use of homophobic slurs once when talking in normal tones outside apartment building where she and alleged victims lived and again when yelling inside her own apartment was intended to be heard by victims or that she should have known that slurs would be heard by them); Demayo v. Quinn,"", ', 116, 118 (2015) (evidence was insufficient to show that defendant\'s conduct -- entering plaintiff\'s horse barn, removing or rearranging items, and throwing items into horse\'s stall -- was aimed at plaintiff).  In response to the police\'s questioning, it was evident that the defendant harbored an animus toward J.D.  Cf. Demayo, supra at 118.  The defendant made a number of statements aimed at the couple regarding J.D.\'s fidelity to J.H.  The defendant stated that he believed J.D. was ""stepping out"" of J.D.\'s marriage and that he wanted to make sure his ""backyard was clear.""  He suggested that J.H. ""might want to start checking [J.D.\'s] phone.""  The defendant stated that he was ""guarding the hen house"" and that his ""only stake in all this [was] to make sure somebody was not in the place that [he was] in all the time.""  When he eventually admitted that he had an account with Brickhouse, he confessed that he was monitoring the movements of J.D. and J.H.  Moreover, the forensic extraction data from the defendant\'s phone showed that he was visiting J.D.\'s Twitter social media page.  The defendant\'s peculiar behavior is exacerbated by the fact that he had never met the couple.', ""Although the defendant's statements during the investigation"", 'Page 152', ""suggest he was monitoring J.D. to protect J.H. from J.D.'s alleged infidelity, the defendant placed GPS devices on both J.D. and J.H.'s vehicles.  The complaint provides no indication that the defendant knew which vehicle J.D. or J.H. drove.  It is a reasonable inference that the defendant targeted both individuals when he attached a device to both vehicles, rather than just one, to ensure that all of J.D.'s potential movements were tracked.  In determining whether acts of harassment are directed at a person, we look not only to statements and conduct of the defendant but to the nature of the act and the natural consequence of the act.  See Johnson, 470 Mass. at 312.  Here, a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have known that placing the GPS devices on both vehicles would alarm both individuals if and when they learned of it.  Because the complaint provides reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to warrant a reasonable person in believing that the defendant targeted both J.D. and J.H., we conclude that the concealment of the two devices on the couple's vehicles constitutes two acts of harassment against J.D. and two acts of harassment against J.H."", 'The Commonwealth argues that the defendant committed at least one act against J.D. and J.H. when he tracked the GPS devices seventeen times over the course of ten days.  The defendant argues that his act of gathering the GPS information and mapping the devices\' coordinates online does not qualify as an ""act"" because neither J.D. nor J.H. was aware that they were being tracked.', 'Neither J.D. nor J.H. had to be aware that they were being tracked for the defendant\'s conduct to qualify as at least one act of harassment against each of them.  The complaint must show that there is probable cause that the ""cumulative effect of the defendant\'s pattern of conduct \'seriously alarm[ed]\' [them] -- not that each individual incident was alarming.""  Commonwealth v. Walters,', ', 699 (2015), S.C.,', '(2018), quoting Johnson, 470 Mass. at 314.  See Johnson, supra (criminal harassment ""statute\'s wording ties the requirement to the over-all pattern of conduct"").  J.D. and J.H. may not have been aware that they were being tracked, but, as the defendant concedes, once they discovered the devices they were seriously alarmed.', 'Adding an awareness element to § 43A would frustrate the purpose of the law.  ""The criminal harassment law was passed in response to a perceived loophole in the stalking statute.  The', 'Page 153', 'stalking statute expressly included within its reach \'threatening\' conduct or acts, but left without remedy those victims plagued by harassment that, although potentially dangerous, did not include an overt \'threat\' and thus was not actionable under existing law"" (citation omitted).  McDonald, 462 Mass. at 241. With advancements in technology it is becoming easier for people to do exactly what the defendant did here.  Once J.D. discovered the GPS devices, it is logical that the defendant\'s tactics used to monitor the couple\'s movements would qualify as acts to satisfy the criminal harassment statute.  Therefore, the couple did not have to know in real time that they were being tracked for the defendant\'s conduct of mapping their locations to constitute at least one act.', ""We recognize that the defendant's conduct of entering the GPS devices' coordinates into an Internet mapping program seventeen times over a ten-day span may be construed as more than one act.  The police report shows that the defendant mapped the GPS coordinates at different times -- sometimes closer in time than others -- on different days.  We count the tracking of the devices as at least one act for purposes of reaching the requisite three acts in § 43A.  We determine, however, that it is unnecessary in this case to conduct a temporal analysis of each time the defendant checked the GPS devices to deconstruct each individual act because we already have identified the three acts to satisfy the statute."", '', 'b.  Substantial emotional distress.  After learning that they were being tracked, the couple suffered substantial emotional distress.  J.D. expressed concern for his safety, changed his work schedule, installed security cameras at his house, and feared retaliation from the defendant for informing the police.  J.H. also was concerned for her safety, was afraid to be home alone at night, and had difficulty sleeping.  The defendant concedes that there was sufficient evidence that the couple was seriously alarmed by his conduct.  He argues, however, that a reasonable person in their', 'Page 154', 'position would not suffer substantial emotional distress.', 'Contrary to the defendant\'s argument, the evidence in the complaint was sufficient to establish probable cause that a reasonable person in J.D. and J.H.\'s positions would have suffered substantial emotional distress.  J.D. found two GPS tracking devices under his and his wife\'s cars that were placed by the defendant -- someone that the couple had never met.  The couple also learned that the defendant had tracked the GPS device\'s location seventeen times over the course of ten days.  Moreover, the defendant made a number of distressing statements regarding J.D.\'s fidelity toward J.H.  There was probable cause that J.D. and J.H. were seriously alarmed, and ""any reasonable person would be greatly alarmed and experience severe emotional distress if subjected to such similar circumstances.""  Commonwealth v. O\'Neil,', ', 294 (2006).', 'c.  Willful and malicious conduct.  The defendant argues that he did not commit the requisite three acts willfully or maliciously as the statute requires.  See G. L. c. 265, § 43A.  ""Wilful conduct is that which is \'intentional rather than accidental\'; it requires no evil intent, ill will, or malevolence.""  McDonald, 462 Mass. at 242, quoting Commonwealth v. Luna,', ', 753 (1994).  Malicious conduct is an ""intentional, wrongful act done willfully or intentionally against another without legal justification or excuse.""  McDonald, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Paton,', ', 219 (2005).', ""As discussed above, the defendant committed at least three acts against J.D. and J.H. when he placed the GPS devices on each of their vehicles and then tracked the GPS devices locations by using his iPhone.  The acts were willful because he intentionally placed the GPS devices and intentionally tracked the locations.  Likewise, the defendant's actions were malicious because he had no justification for his conduct.  See O'Neil, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 293.  It was also reasonably foreseeable that J.D. and J.H. would be alarmed when they learned that they were being tracked.  See McDonald, 462 Mass. at 242, quoting Commonwealth v. Schuchardt,"", ', 352 (1990) (""Conduct is wilful when the actor intends both the conduct and its harmful consequences [and] may be wilful and malicious although its harmful consequences are neither substantial nor highly likely"").', '4.  Conclusion.  Probable cause must be determined from the totality of the circumstances.  \r\n\r\nCommonwealth v. Hernandez,', 'Page 155', '', ', 715 (2007).  It is a concept guided by ""factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent [people], not legal technicians, act.""  Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175 (1949).  The Commonwealth has made the requisite showing.  There was probable cause that the defendant committed three separate acts of intentional harassment when he placed the GPS device on J.D.\'s car, placed the GPS device on J.H.\'s car, and then tracked the movements of the devices.  The acts were done willfully and maliciously, seriously alarmed J.D. and J.H., and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.', 'As technology has advanced, the tools that people can use to harass victims have increased.  See Fraser, Olsen, Lee, Southworth, and Tucker, The New Age of Stalking:  Technological Implications for Stalking, 61 Juv. & Fam. Ct. J. 39, 40-41 (Fall 2010).

The Legislature may wish to explore whether the conduct of a private person electronically monitoring the movements of another private person should be criminalized, regardless of whether it would constitute criminal harassment.', ""In these circumstances, the defendant's behavior satisfied the three acts necessary for the criminal harassment statute, but there may be occasions where the"", 'Page 156', ""facts might not be sufficient for the statute to encompass a defendant's conduct."", '', 'Order allowing motion to dismiss reversed.']"

The victim's motor vehicle thereafter proceeded a short way down the street, left the roadway, knocked down a fence, and crashed into a couple motor vehicles parked in a nearby lot.  Neighbors found the victim breathing but unable to respond to questions.  He died soon after from a gunshot wound to the chest."", 'In the meantime, after the shooting, the defendant hid the firearm in a tree stump located in the backyard of a neighboring home and then contacted a friend, Miguel Sierra, who retrieved (and later sold) the firearm and provided the defendant with travel arrangements to Connecticut the next day.

The defendant argues that the judge improperly curtailed his cross-examination of Sierra, thereby denying him the ability to demonstrate to the jury the witness\'s true motivation for testifying against the defendant, i.e., that in exchange Sierra would receive a ""deal"" on then-pending charges.  Contrary to his assertion, the defendant had ample opportunity to explore fully Sierra\'s motivation to cooperate with the government through both cross- and recross-examination.', 'On direct examination, Sierra acknowledged that he was cooperating with the Commonwealth in exchange for a ""deal"" on two drug charges.  During cross-examination, trial counsel explored thoroughly the particulars of the cooperation agreement -- that is, in exchange for testifying, Sierra received a prison sentence of from two and one-half to three years on a drug charge from 2008 and expected to receive a probation sentence of five years on a pending drug charge from 2009.', 'Sierra also conceded on cross-examination that he came forward to cooperate only after he had been charged in a second drug case, and that he expected to receive immunity for the assistance he gave the defendant after the shooting.  The initial cross-examination began and ended with Sierra acknowledging all of the particulars of the ""deal.""', 'On redirect examination, the Commonwealth sought to minimize the significance of the benefits Sierra was to receive by asking if there were other reasons why he was testifying at trial.  Sierra responded:  ""The only reason I\'m testifying is because I want his family to know what really happened to this kid, because I don\'t think they know what really happened . . . .""', '', 'Page 193', 'On recross-examination the defendant sought to reemphasize the ""deal"" in an attempt to establish it as the ""real reason"" Sierra was testifying.  Although the defendant contends that, during his recross-examination, the judge improperly precluded him from demonstrating Sierra\'s bias by sustaining the Commonwealth\'s objections, we are hard pressed to understand the concerns he raises.  The Commonwealth\'s first two objections were to questions that had been asked and answered previously and had nothing to do with Sierra\'s motivation to cooperate with the government.', 'The judge was well within his discretion to limit repetitive questions.

Porreca grew up in Medford and was friends with each of the defendants.  Porreca introduced the defendants to each other in 1994 or 1995, after which the defendants became ""close.""  Porreca was also friends with Giangrande, an area bookmaker and drug dealer; William Angelesco, a friend of Giangrande\'s who was known to be connected with organized crime; and McCormack, the victim.  Porreca was a former professional boxer and collected debts owed to Giangrande, who would pay him in cash or with Percocet pills.  Porreca had a lengthy criminal history.  The jury also heard evidence of Porreca\'s substance abuse.  He admitted to being addicted to opiates and having consumed two or three Percocet pills on the morning of the shooting.', 'At the time of the murder, Porreca was under Federal investigation for his involvement in the kidnapping of an area drug dealer that took place in 1995 (kidnapping).  Allegedly, Porreca and another man, in an attempt to determine the location of a shipment of marijuana from Mexico, kidnapped the drug dealer and brought him to a house in Medford.  The man was tied up, sprayed with lighter fluid, and questioned as Porreca held a gun', 'Page 392', 'and another man held a lighter.  After approximately one hour, Porreca and the other man released the kidnapped party.  In early April 1999, Porreca received a summons to appear before a Federal grand jury, and met with several members of law enforcement to discuss the likely charges against him.  Porreca left that meeting believing that he was facing fifteen or more years in prison if he did not cooperate with law enforcement; and if he did, his likely sentence would be reduced to approximately five years.', '3.  Additional trial evidence.  The jury also heard testimony of the police investigation into the shooting.  Porreca was interviewed by police at the hospital and was initially uncooperative.  He first said that ""two white guys"" whom he knew had conducted the shooting, but later stated that it was actually ""two black guys.""  Eventually, Porreca told a State police trooper investigating the shooting that he would identify the shooters in exchange for a promise that he would not go to prison for his involvement in the kidnapping.  Porreca received such an assurance from the United States Attorney\'s office, agreed to cooperate, and identified the defendants to the police.', ""Pursuant to search warrants, police searched Cahill's residence in Randolph and recovered an ammunition can with a sticker from an army-navy style surplus store in Malden with a large pair of Hatch-brand leather gloves.  A search of Barry's apartment in Melrose also yielded two Nomex hoods"", ""and an extra-large pair of Hatch gloves in a box with two bulletproof vests.  The owner of the surplus store testified that two young men loosely matching the defendants' descriptions had purchased two pairs of Hatch gloves (one large and one extra-large), two Nomex hoods, and a can of .30 caliber ammunition one week before the shooting.  A DNA expert testified that a saliva sample found on one of the Nomex hoods found in Barry's apartment matched Cahill's DNA."", ""A medical examiner testified about the autopsy he performed on McCormack.  Detailing McCormack's injuries, he first described the gunshot wound to McCormack's head and offered his opinion that that wound alone was lethal.

First motion for a new trial.  In 2002, approximately two years after trial, the defendants filed their first motion for a new trial.', 'After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the motion was denied.', ""The primary arguments in the first motion centered on evidence discovered after trial that the defendants contended would have assisted their attack on Porreca's credibility.  They also presented evidence that suggested that Giangrande and Angelesco had admitted to others that they, rather than the defendants, were the shooters."", 'The defendants maintained that the Commonwealth intentionally withheld evidence that Porreca was brought by police to Saints Memorial Hospital in Lowell on April 21, 1999, four days after the shooting, where he complained that he was in heroin withdrawal.  In those records, medical staff noted that Porreca stated to them to be ""drug sick"" and that one of the police officers accompanying him indicated that he had been vomiting for most of the previous night.  At the evidentiary hearing, two doctors opined about Porreca\'s medical records.  One of the doctors described the effects of opiate withdrawal and indicated that Porreca\'s behavior at the hospital was consistent with being in withdrawal, and that Porreca\'s actions immediately after the shooting were consistent with being intoxicated at the time.  In contrast, the doctor who treated Porreca testified that, although he did not remember treating Porreca, he also did not document any symptoms of withdrawal.  The treating doctor also testified that the records suggested that Porreca was not in withdrawal during the visit.  The judge who heard the first motion for a new trial (first motion judge) credited the testimony of the doctor who had treated Porreca.', 'The defendants contended that the Commonwealth withheld these medical records in violation of Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, which requires that the Commonwealth disclose to defendants all exculpatory evidence in its control.  The first motion judge ultimately', 'Page 394', 'held that, although the medical records were exculpatory and were in the Commonwealth\'s possession, the defendants were not prejudiced by the Commonwealth\'s failure to produce the records because they were cumulative of other evidence presented at trial and did not ""carry a measure of strength in support of the defendant.""  Commonwealth v. Bregoli,', ', 272 (2000), quoting Commonwealth v. Tucceri,', ', 414 (1992).', '5.  Second motion for a new trial.  The defendants filed a second motion for a new trial in November 2014, raising several issues, including an argument that the Commonwealth withheld newly discovered pieces of exculpatory evidence.  The motion was denied following a nonevidentiary hearing, the judge (second motion judge)', 'having deemed an evidentiary hearing unnecessary because the defendants did not raise a serious question under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in  435 Mass. 1501  (2001), and the briefs, transcripts, and supporting documents were sufficient to allow the second motion judge to make an informed decision.', 'The defendants maintained that police reports discovered after trial constituted Brady violations, and that six pieces of newly discovered evidence cast doubt on the convictions and warranted a new trial.  As the defendants now assert error in the denial of this motion for each of these pieces of evidence, we briefly detail each piece in turn.', 'a.  Orlando reports.  The defendants discovered two reports authored after the trial by Sergeant Nunzio Orlando of the State police (Orlando reports), one dated July 17, 2001, and the other dated July 25, 2001.  The July 17 report was heavily redacted and described information gleaned from a confidential informant, who stated in part that ""Angelesco \'got straightened out\' because he shot and killed \'Mucka\' McCormack in Malden.""  The July 25 report indicated that Angelesco had become a ""made member"" in the Boston mafia and that he had ""\'earned his bones\' by killing \'Mucka\' McCormack.""  The informant also stated that ""Anthony Barry was not the shooter in the McCormack murder.  Barry was behind the scenes as far as orchestrating McCormack\'s assassination, but Angelesco and Cahill were the actual shooters.  In addition, Gene Giangrande allegedly drove the getaway vehicle.""  The second motion judge analyzed these two reports under Brady', 'Page 395', ""and determined that they were not possessed by the Commonwealth, were not exculpatory because they would not have been admissible at trial, and were not prejudicial because they would not have had an impact on the jury's conclusion."", 'b.  Montana report.  A report written by Sergeant David Montana of the Medford police department (Montana report) relayed a conversation he had with an individual who implicated a third party, Robert Rennell, as the shooter in McCormack\'s murder.  This individual further stated that ""there was no way that Anthony Barry"" was the shooter, and that Porreca had contacted him indicating that he was willing to alter his testimony in exchange for $100,000.  The second motion judge concluded that the Montana report had not been possessed by the prosecution, was inculpatory despite appearing exculpatory on its face because of the fruits of subsequent police investigation, and was not prejudicial because it was unlikely to have had an impact on the jury\'s conclusion.', ""c.  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives report.  The final asserted Brady violation raised in the second motion for a new trial concerned an unredacted version of a report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF report) detailing an interview of Porreca conducted on April 21, 1999.  In the redacted version of the report, which the defense possessed at the time of trial, Porreca stated that he had spoken to a friend of McCormack, Johnnie Decologero, at the bar on the night of the shooting and that Barry did not get along with Decologero's brother, Paul.  The unredacted version indicated, among other things, that Paul Decologero had initiated the 1995 kidnapping for which Porreca was under Federal investigation in 1999."", 'The second motion judge determined that neither version of the ATF report was exculpatory, particularly because even the redacted version named the defendants as the shooters.  He further concluded that the defendants had not established that the unredacted version of the report, created by a Federal agency, was ever in the possession of the Commonwealth.  Finally, the judge determined that the defendants did not establish that they were prejudiced by not possessing the unredacted ATF report.', ""d.  Newly discovered evidence.  The second motion judge also considered the defendants' argument that six pieces of newly discovered evidence would have had an impact on the jury's verdicts.  Those pieces of evidence include a third report authored by"", 'Page 396', 'Orlando on July 26, 2001,', ""additional evidence of Porreca's drug use, an affidavit from Whitson, an affidavit from Brittany Cahill, evidence that Angelesco had committed a different murder, and evidence that police intimidated potential witnesses prior to the hearing on the first motion for a new trial.  The motion was denied, and the judge reached the following conclusions:  (1) the absence of the July 26 Orlando report did not undermine the denial of the first motion for a new trial; (2) the evidence regarding Porreca's drug use was cumulative, not newly discovered, and insufficient to warrant a new trial as it went merely to credibility; (3) Whitson's affidavit, which contradicted Porreca's testimony that he had cursed Barry's and Cahill's names to Whitson after retreating into the bar following the shooting, was reasonably discoverable at the time of trial and cumulative of other testimony undercutting Porreca's recollection; (4) Brittany Cahill's affidavit, in which she recanted portions of her testimony against her brother, was inconsequential to the jury's verdicts; (5)  evidence that Angelesco was indicted for and acquitted of a different murder with loose factual similarities to McCormack's death would not have been admissible at the defendants' trial as evidence of a third-party culprit; and (6) the defendants' argument that law enforcement targeted potential witnesses with search and arrest warrants to discourage them from testifying at the hearing on the first motion for a new trial was meritless because the actions of the police were the result of a long investigation."", ""e.  DNA expert.  The defendants' second motion for a new trial also challenged the DNA testimony at trial, asserting that their constitutional right to confrontation had been violated because the DNA expert had not conducted the testing.  The second motion judge determined that the expert, who was the director of the laboratory where the DNA was analyzed, discussed his laboratory's procedures and then opined that the DNA found in saliva on the Nomex hood was a near certain match to Cahill's DNA.  The judge held that, because the expert was referring to his own conclusions based on a report that he was involved in creating, he was not a substitute expert and the defendants' right to confrontation"", 'Page 397', ""was not implicated.  The judge further concluded that the defendants' challenge to the reliability of the DNA testing itself, which was based on testing of only eight DNA loci, was unfounded.  The judge noted the expert's testimony that using eight loci was an accepted method in the scientific community and observed that the defendants failed to establish that the method was unreliable."", ""f.  Court room closure.  The defendants asserted that the trial judge's practice of conducting a hardship inquiry of jurors outside the presence of the defendants and their counsel, as well as the exclusion of members of the defendants' families during jury selection, constituted constitutional violations warranting a new trial.  The second motion judge concluded that the hardship inquiry was not a critical stage of the proceedings and therefore did not implicate the defendants' constitutional rights.  Additionally, the judge found that the argument regarding the exclusion of family members from jury selection was waived because it had neither been preserved at trial nor raised in the first motion for a new trial, and that the defendants failed to establish that it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice."", 'Discussion.  The defendants\' appeals from the denial of their motions for a new trial have been consolidated with their direct appeals from their convictions of murder in the first degree.  We review both under G.

The medical examiner noted McCormack\'s cause of death as ""multiple gunshot wounds.""  The two gunshots were fired from two different weapons.  The gunshot to the head was from a .40 caliber firearm.  The gunshot to the back was from a different firearm of an undetermined caliber.  The witness described the two defendants as the only two shooters.', 'We find support in several past decisions of this court.  The Maynard case and Commonwealth v. Perry,', '(2000), involved a victim who was subjected to numerous blunt force injuries and starvation over several months by the respective defendants.  Maynard, 436 Mass. at 559-561.  Perry, 432 Mass. at 215-219.  In those cases, which each considered the same murder, the medical examiner testified that he could not determine which act was fatal, but that ""the cumulative effect of the beatings and starvation led to the victim\'s death.""  Perry, supra at 220-221.  See Maynard, supra at 563.  We concluded that there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendants under both principal and joint venture theories of liability.  Id. at 565.  Perry, supra at 221.  In this case, the evidence that the defendants caused McCormack\'s death is much stronger than it was in the Perry and Maynard cases.  The judge\'s denial of the defendants\' motion for a required finding of not guilty was proper.', 'Page 399', ""2.  First motion for a new trial.  The defendants maintain that the Commonwealth intentionally withheld hospital records from a visit Porreca made to Saints Memorial Hospital on April 21, 1999.  Porreca complained that he was in heroin withdrawal and requested methadone, and the defendants argue that the temporal proximity of this withdrawal to the shooting would have undermined Porreca's testimony that he was not influenced by drugs at the time of the shooting.  This, the defendants contend, prejudiced their defense in such a way that their first motion for a new trial should have been allowed."", '""Evidence is exculpatory if it \'provides some significant aid to the defendant\'s case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant\'s story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution\'s version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.\'""  Commonwealth v. Watkins,', ', 231 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Daniels,', ', 401-402 (2005).  ""To obtain a new trial on the basis of nondisclosed exculpatory evidence, a defendant must establish (1) that \'the evidence [was] in the possession, custody, or control of the prosecutor or a person subject to the prosecutor\'s control\'; (2) \'that the evidence is exculpatory\'; and (3) \'prejudice.\'""  Commonwealth v. Sullivan,', ', 380 (2017), quoting Commonwealth v. Murray,', "", 19, 21 (2011).  The first motion judge determined, and we agree, that the defense did not make a specific discovery request that encompassed Porreca's medical records."", 'Where no specific request for a particular piece of evidence is made, we', 'Page 400', 'determine prejudice using the same standard ""used to assess the impact of newly discovered evidence, that is, \'whether there is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion if the evidence had been admitted at trial.\'""  Murray, supra at 21, quoting Commonwealth v. Tucceri,', ', 413 (1992).  ""Newly discovered evidence that tends merely to impeach the credibility of a witness will not ordinarily be the basis of a new trial.""  Sullivan, supra at 383, quoting Commonwealth v. Lo,', ', 53 (1998).', 'Because we agree with the first motion judge that there is no substantial risk of an impact on the verdicts had evidence of Porreca\'s trip to Saints Memorial Hospital been before the jury, we need not address the other two factors underlying a new trial motion on the basis of nondisclosed exculpatory evidence.  See Sullivan, 478 Mass. at 380.  Porreca was extensively cross-examined over the course of two days, during which he admitted that he was addicted to opiates, had often been paid in Percocet pills by Giangrande, had consumed two or three Percocet pills on the day of the shooting, and had consumed five or six beers while at the bar immediately before the shooting.  He denied having been under the influence, at the time of the shooting, of the Percocet pills that he had consumed earlier in the day, reasoning that he had consumed only two or three pills and that he would have needed to consume approximately five pills to feel any effect ""because [his] system had been used to them.""  Porreca also testified that he had been given Percocet while in the hospital after the shooting, and was prescribed an additional ten Percocet pills on his discharge from the hospital on April 19.', ""Given this testimony, the exculpatory nature of the evidence of Porreca's complaint of heroin withdrawal four days after the shooting was cumulative of evidence already before the jury, and we are not persuaded that it would have had an impact on the jury's verdicts.  Porreca's drug use was well established, and he admitted that he consumed Percocet pills and drank several beers on the day of the shooting.  His credibility was called into question extensively on cross-examination on several grounds, not limited to his drug use, and the jury nonetheless convicted the defendants.  See Commonwealth v. Dubois,"", ', 28 (2008) (""The weight and credibility of the evidence is the province of the jury"").  The Saints Memorial Hospital records, at most, would have provided additional grounds to impeach Porreca on the truthfulness of his testimony regarding his sobriety on the night of the', 'Page 401', 'shooting.  Commonwealth v. Lykus,', ', 326 (2008) (evidence cumulative of that ""admitted at the trial will carry little weight"").  See Sullivan, 478 Mass. at 380.  Had those records been available to the defense, there would not have been an impact on the jury\'s verdicts.', '3.  Second motion for a new trial.  The defendants raise several arguments stemming from the denial of their second motion for a new trial.  We address each in turn.', 'a.  Decision not to hold evidentiary hearing.  We first address the defendants\' contention that the second motion judge\'s decision to proceed without an evidentiary hearing was error.  We disagree.  Under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3), as appearing in  435 Mass. 1501  (2001), a judge must determine whether the defendants\' motion presents a ""substantial issue"" in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary.  Commonwealth v. Denis,', ', 628 (2004).  ""Although the motions and supporting materials filed by a defendant need not prove the issue raised therein, they must at least contain sufficient credible information to cast doubt on the issue"" in order to create a substantial issue.  Id. at 629.  In determining whether a substantial issue exists, ""a judge considers the seriousness of the issues raised and the adequacy of the defendant\'s showing on those issues.""  Commonwealth v. Torres,', "", 402-403 (2014).  Whether to hold an evidentiary hearing is a decision squarely within the judge's discretion, and we review the decision for an abuse of discretion.  Denis, supra at 628."", ""The second motion judge determined that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary because the defendants did not raise a serious question and because the briefs, supporting documents, and trial transcripts were sufficient to allow him to reach an informed decision.  We conclude that the record before the judge and the contents of the reports and affidavits that formed the basis for the legal arguments raised in the second motion for a new trial did not require an evidentiary hearing, and that the judge's decision that an evidentiary hearing was not warranted was a proper exercise of his discretion.  See Commonwealth v. McWilliams,"", ', 622-623 (2016).', ""b.  Police reports.  We next address the defendants' argument that the judge erred in declining to find a Brady violation.  The defendants, having discovered additional law enforcement reports after their first motion for a new trial had been decided, presented three claimed new Brady violations based on those reports.  The"", 'Page 402', 'judge did not err in concluding that there were no Brady violations.', 'i.  Montana report.  The Montana report detailed an interview conducted by a member of the Medford police department during which an individual implicated a third party as the shooter in McCormack\'s murder, indicated that ""there was no way"" that Barry was the shooter, and stated that Porreca had told the individual that he was willing to change his testimony in exchange for $100,000.  As there was no specific discovery request that encompassed this report, we analyze any error to determine ""whether there is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion if the evidence had been admitted at trial.""  Murray, 461 Mass. at 21, quoting Tucceri, 412 Mass. at 413.  Assuming without deciding that the Montana report satisfies the first two prongs of Brady, we conclude that there was no prejudice because the defendants cannot establish that the Montana report creates a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had it been admitted.  See Murray, supra at 19-21.', 'The Montana report implicates a potential third-party culprit who had not otherwise been considered in the investigation.  However, the report does not indicate the basis for the statement that Barry could not have been the shooter.  See Tucceri, 412 Mass. at 414 (if evidence ""does not carry a measure of strength in support of the defendant, the failure to disclose that evidence does not warrant the granting of a new trial"").  Finally, to the extent that evidence of Porreca\'s willingness to alter his testimony in exchange for money could have been used to impeach his credibility, ""evidence that tends merely to impeach the credibility of a witness will not ordinarily be the basis of a new trial.""  Sullivan, 478 Mass. at 383, quoting Lo, 428 Mass. at 53.  Moreover, any additional impeachment evidence, unsupported by details and uncorroborated by additional evidence, would not have influenced the jury\'s conclusion because Porreca\'s credibility was already very much called into question on cross-examination.  We therefore conclude that there was no prejudice.', 'We further note that the individual who provided the information in the Montana report wrote an affidavit that undermines the exculpatory nature of the Montana report and led to an investigation that further inculpates the defendants.  That person stated that he did not remember telling Sergeant Montana that Rennell shot McCormack or that Porreca stated that he was willing to', 'Page 403', 'change his story and that neither of those things is true.  He further discussed his relationship with an area drug dealer who had tried to sell him stolen guns from New Hampshire, and eventually sold Barry a .40 caliber pistol.  The pistol left at the scene of the shooting that was used to shoot McCormack in the head was confirmed to be a gun that had been stolen from a person in Derry, New Hampshire.', 'A motion for a new trial may be granted ""if it appears that justice may not have been done.""  Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b).  The exculpatory nature of the Montana report has since been recanted and prompted police investigation that directly tied Barry to one of the murder weapons.  As we are considering whether substantial justice was done, we see no reason that we cannot consider additional evidence that stemmed from that police investigation.', 'With the fruits of that investigation in mind, any argument that this report would warrant a new trial in the interests of justice is disingenuous.', 'ii.  ATF report.  The defendants\' asserted Brady violation stemming from the unredacted ATF report also fails, because the ATF report was not exculpatory.  The report\'s only mention of McCormack\'s murder is that Porreca stated, ""Anthony Barry, one of the shooters along with Brian Cahill, didn\'t get along with Paul A. Decologero.""  The defendants, however, maintain that Porreca\'s cooperation with law enforcement and the ATF report\'s discussion of the involvement of Decologero in the kidnapping provide for the possibility of a third-party defense, because the ATF report could arguably indicate that Decologero had motive to kill Porreca.  But the ATF report inculpates the defendants by saying that they were the shooters.  Any motive that could be gleaned from the ATF report would not be a significant enough aid to the defense to be deemed exculpatory.', 'iii.  Orlando reports.  Lastly, we address the three Orlando reports.  Although the second motion judge treated the July 26, 2001, Orlando report as newly discovered evidence and reviewed', 'Page 404', 'the July 17 and July 25 reports under Brady, we review all three Orlando reports as newly discovered evidence because they were all created after trial.  ""A defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish both that the evidence is newly discovered and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.""  Commonwealth v. Grace,', ', 305 (1986).  As a threshold matter, newly discovered evidence ""must be material and credible.""  Id.  We conclude that the contents of the Orlando reports are not credible and therefore cast no doubt on the convictions.', 'The confidential informant in the Orlando reports told Trooper Orlando that he did not have firsthand knowledge of who the shooters were, that he was not present at the time of the murder, and that his information that Angelesco was the shooter and Giangrande the getaway driver was based on ""word on the street.""  ""\'[W]ord on the street\' carries no indicia of reliability by itself, and defense counsel did not bolster it by showing that the \'word\' came from a percipient witness to the shooting.""  Commonwealth v. Silva-Santiago,', ', 804-805 (2009).', 'Because unsubstantiated rumors pointing to Angelesco and Giangrande as the true culprits do not cast doubt on the justice of the convictions, the existence of the Orlando reports does not require a new trial.', ""c.  Additional newly discovered evidence.  In their second motion for a new trial, the defendants also relied on five additional pieces of purportedly newly discovered evidence:  (1) additional evidence of Porreca's drug use"", '; (2) an affidavit from Whitson; (3) an affidavit from Brittany Cahill; (4) evidence that Angelesco had committed a different murder; and (5) evidence of intimidation of potential witnesses before the hearing on the first motion for a new trial.  Evidence is newly discovered if it was ""unknown to the defendant or his counsel and not reasonably discoverable by them at the time of trial (or at the time of the presentation of an earlier motion for a new trial).""  Grace, 397 Mass. at 306.  Newly discovered evidence ""must [also] carry a measure of strength in', 'Page 405', 'support of the defendant\'s position,"" and will carry less weight if it ""is cumulative of evidence admitted at the trial.""  Id. at 305-306.', 'i.  Whitson affidavit.  Whitson\'s affidavit indicates that he was inside the bar when the shooting took place outside, that he spoke to Porreca after Porreca had been shot, and that Porreca ""did not mention the names of Anthony Barry and Brian Cahill"" to him.  Whitson\'s affidavit directly contradicts a key portion of Porreca\'s testimony at trial, where Porreca stated that he ran into the bar after being shot and said ""Fuck\'n Barry and Cahill"" to Whitson.  However, the defendants have failed to establish that the contents of Whitson\'s affidavit were unknown to their counsel at the time of trial.  When Porreca was about to testify that he had implicated the defendants to Whitson after being shot, Barry\'s counsel was heard at a sidebar conference.  Counsel told the trial judge that ""Whitson was interviewed by the grand jury and by police, he has denied that this statement was made . . . by Porreca to him.""  Because defense counsel knew before trial that Whitson had said Porreca never implicated the defendants, Whitson\'s affidavit is not ""newly discovered.""  See Grace, 397 Mass. at 306.', 'ii.  Brittany Cahill affidavit.  Brittany Cahill testified against her brother and Barry at trial when she was fourteen years old.  Her testimony indicated that Cahill and Barry planned to be together the night of the shooting, that Cahill laughed when reading a newspaper article about the shooting, that Cahill talked to himself while laughing as he drove by the bar three days after the shooting, that Cahill was counting $900 in cash three days after the shooting at a time in which he was unemployed, and that Cahill told her, in a telephone call from jail several weeks after the shooting, not to give information to the police.', 'Her 2009 affidavit recanted portions of her testimony, in particular denying that Cahill had laughed while reading the newspaper, that he had laughed and talked to himself while driving past the bar, or that he had stated that the $900 he was counting was from ""doing his business.""  She further indicated that her false testimony was the result of pressure from Trooper Manning, whom she claims said to her, among other things, that she would get in trouble if she did not testify against her brother.  Assuming without deciding that Brittany Cahill\'s affidavit constitutes newly discovered evidence, her recantation is ultimately inconsequential to the outcome of the trial.  There was significant evidence pointing to the defendants as the shooters, and although Brittany Cahill\'s testimony did have some corroborative value to the', 'Page 406', 'Commonwealth\'s case, ""the absence of [her recanted] testimony at trial would not have changed the verdict[s].""  Commonwealth v. Spray,', ', 472 (2014).  See Grace, 397 Mass. at 306 (""The strength of the case against a criminal defendant . . . may weaken the effect of [newly discovered] evidence"").', 'iii.  Evidence that Angelesco committed a different murder.  The defendants next contend that they were entitled to a new trial because of evidence that Angelesco was indicted for a different murder that had similar facts to McCormack\'s murder.  In that unrelated murder, of which Angelesco was acquitted, a gun was left at the scene, as was the case in McCormack\'s murder.  Evidence of this separate murder is irrelevant to any third-party culprit defense the defendants may have raised at trial and would not have been admissible.  ""[I]n order to be admitted, third-party culprit evidence \'must have a rational tendency to prove the issue the defense raises, and [it] cannot be too remote or speculative.\'""  Commonwealth v. Scott,', ', 327 (2014), quoting Silva-Santiago, 453 Mass. at 801.  See Commonwealth v. Brusgulis,', ', 506 (1990) (modus operandi evidence only admissible if there is ""a uniqueness of technique, a distinctiveness, or a particularly distinguishing pattern of conduct common to the current and former incidents"").  This evidence does not warrant a new trial.', 'iv.  Witness intimidation.  The defendants\' final argument from their second motion for a new trial stems from their first motion for a new trial, as they allege that members of the State police intimidated five witnesses the defendants intended to call at the hearing on the first motion by executing search and arrest warrants against them.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that those warrants were illegitimate, and the arrest reports note that they were the product of a ""lengthy investigation.""  The criminal complaints against these five potential witnesses detail ongoing narcotics activity, and the defendants have provided no evidence to support their claims that law enforcement used these arrests as a means to dissuade the potential witnesses from testifying at the hearing on the first motion for a new trial.', 'The burden was on the defendants to prove the facts underlying their motion; as they failed to do so regarding their witness intimidation claim, their argument regarding the second motion for a new trial fails.  See', 'Page 407', 'Commonwealth v. Marinho,', ', 123 (2013) (""A defendant bears the burden of proof on a motion for new trial"").', ""v.  Court room closure.  Cahill maintains that his right to a public trial was violated when the trial judge conducted the hardship voir dire in the jury room without counsel or defendants present, and when the defendants' family members were excluded from the court room during jury selection.  Because Cahill failed to object to either alleged error at trial, the claims are procedurally waived.  See Commonwealth v. Robinson,"", ', 152 (2018) (""where a defendant fails to contemporaneously object to an improper court room closure at trial, we have steadfastly held that the defendant\'s claim is procedurally waived"").', ""Therefore, we review any error for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and having found nothing that calls into question the legitimacy of the jury's verdicts, we conclude that the defendants' motion for a new trial was properly denied on these grounds.  See id. at 154-155."", ""vi.  DNA.  The defendants challenge the second motion judge's determination that the DNA expert who testified at trial was not a substitute expert and that their claim that the method of testing was unreliable was unfounded.  The defendants did not object to the DNA expert's testimony at trial, so we review their claim to determine whether there was error in allowing him to testify and, if so, whether that error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  We conclude that there was no error."", 'The expert was the director and vice-president of the laboratory where the testing took place, he detailed the procedure that would have taken place to test the samples, and he testified that, after reviewing the DNA samples, he had determined that the DNA found on the Nomex hood matched Cahill\'s DNA profile.  He observed that ""the probability of drawing at random a DNA pattern like that of Mr. Cahill\'s is one in [181] billion [among', 'Page 408', 'Caucasians].""', '""The critical issue with respect to an expert, including in particular a DNA analyst, is whether the defendant is able to cross-examine the expert in a meaningful way regarding possible flaws relating to the underlying data that forms the basis of his or her opinion.""  Commonwealth v. Chappell,', ', 201 (2015).  The defendants\' rights were protected in this case, because the DNA expert participated in the analysis of the samples and testified about a report detailing his conclusions that he personally submitted to the prosecution.  He was not a substitute expert, and his testimony did not implicate the confrontation clause.  See Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647, 652 (2011) (""The accused\'s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification . . ."").  Cf. Commonwealth v. Tassone,', ', 399 (2014) (""our common law of evidence requires that the defendant have a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the expert about her opinion and the reliability of the facts or data that underlie her opinion"").  Even if he were considered a substitute expert, his testimony would have been admissible because there is no requirement that the person who physically tested DNA samples testify, and it is well established that an expert can testify to his own opinions after interpreting data and reaching his own conclusions.  See Commonwealth v. Sanchez,', ', 733 (2017); Commonwealth v. Greineder,', ', 601-602, cert. denied, 571 U.S. 865 (2013); Commonwealth v. Barbosa,', ', 791 (2010), cert. denied, 563 U.S. 990 (2011).  Cf. Chappell, supra at 202 (""under Massachusetts law, an expert witness is not permitted to testify on direct examination to facts or data that another, nontestifying expert has generated, or to the nontestifying expert\'s own opinion, even though this information may be an important part of the basis of the testifying expert\'s opinion"").', 'The defendants further assert that the DNA testing, which compared Cahill\'s blood sample and the DNA sample from the Nomex hood using eight loci, was unreliable when considered in light of subsequent scientific advancements.  The defendants contend that because testing involving thirteen loci would ""offer[] a material improvement in accuracy,"" there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  See Commonwealth v. Donald,', ', 45-46 (2014) (analysis using thirteen loci reduced probability of random match to one in several trillion or quadrillion).  However, the defendants have not called into question the', 'Page 409', ""legitimacy of the expert's conclusion that the probability of a random match was one in 181 billion.  That another method of testing may have yielded an even more reliable result does not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice."", ""vii.  Pretrial disclosure and the confrontation clause.  The defendants asserted in their second motion for a new trial that the failure to turn over medical evidence regarding Porreca's drug use violated their right to confrontation.  The second motion judge gave little credence to this argument, because it is well established that the right to confrontation is a trial right and is inapplicable to pretrial discovery under both art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See Commonwealth v. Figueroa,"", ', 400 (2011), quoting Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 53 (1987).  The defendants now ask us to depart from precedent and extend the right to confrontation.  We decline to do so.', '""[T]he principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.""  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50 (2004).  ""A witness\'s testimony against a defendant is thus inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.""  Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 309 (2009), citing Crawford, supra at 54.  The right to confrontation, under both art. 12 and the Sixth Amendment, has been considered to be a trial right.  Figueroa, 79 Mass. App. Ct. at 400.  There was no error in the second motion judge\'s treatment of the right to confrontation as such, and we conclude that there is no reason to depart from that interpretation.', '4.  Identity of confidential informant.  In December 2015, the defendants filed a discovery motion seeking, in part, the disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant discussed in the Orlando reports.  The motion was denied.  The second motion judge determined that the Commonwealth had established that disclosing the informant\'s identity would endanger the informant, and that the defendant failed to show that the ""informant privilege"" interfered with a fair defense.  The defendants now contend that the judge erred in denying the motion.  We conclude that there was no error.', 'The defendants contend that the Orlando reports indicate that the confidential informant had firsthand knowledge that Angelesco,', 'Page 410', 'not the defendants, murdered McCormack, and that Giangrande ""drove the getaway vehicle.""  As discussed supra, the Commonwealth filed an affidavit by Sergeant Orlando clarifying that the confidential informant did not have firsthand knowledge, was not a percipient witness, and did not hear the information from Angelesco or Giangrande, but rather learned it through ""word on the street.""  The Commonwealth withheld the confidential informant\'s identity under the ""informant privilege.""  The informant privilege ""may be asserted where the Commonwealth otherwise would be required to provide an informant\'s identity to a defendant as part of its discovery obligations.""', 'Commonwealth v. Bonnett,', ', 846 (2015).  The privilege\'s rationale ""is the need to encourage \'citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials.\'""  Id., quoting Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957).', 'Determining whether an informant\'s identity was properly withheld requires a two-step inquiry.  In the first stage, we must determine ""(a) whether the Commonwealth has properly asserted an informant privilege, and (b) whether the defendant has adequately challenged the assertion of the privilege as an impermissible interference with his or her right to present a defense.""  Bonnett, 472 Mass. at 846.  The Commonwealth may assert the privilege only where ""disclosure would endanger the informant or otherwise impede law enforcement efforts.""  Id. at 847.  If the Commonwealth has properly asserted the privilege, ""the defendant may request that the privilege be set aside on the grounds that it \'interferes with a fair defence.\'""  Id., quoting Commonwealth v. Johnson,', ', 544 (1974).  In so requesting, a defendant must ""present \'some offering so that the trial judge may assess the materiality and relevancy of the disclosure to the defense,\'"" but only if it ""is not apparent from the nature of the case and the defense offered thereto.""  Bonnett, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Kelsey,', ', 323 (2013).', 'If the Commonwealth properly invoked the privilege and the defendants adequately challenged the assertion of the privilege, then we move to the second step and balance ""the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the [defendant]\'s right to prepare his defense.""  Commonwealth v. Dias,', ',', 'Page 411', '468 (2008).  In doing so, we consider ""the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the [privileged] testimony, and other relevant factors.""  Id. at 468-469, quoting Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 62.', 'We agree with the second motion judge that the Commonwealth properly invoked the informant privilege.  As the Commonwealth noted, the individuals identified in the Orlando reports have a history of violent crimes, including against witnesses in this case.', ""The threat of violence against witnesses posed by these individuals has been so great that a single justice of this court ordered the deposition of Porreca before trial, out of concern that he would be killed before testifying.  Porreca remained in hiding for at least eighteen months before the defendants' trial, in part out of fear of retribution by Angelesco and Giangrande."", 'We also agree with the second motion judge that the defendants failed to challenge adequately the assertion of the privilege.  While the confidential informant\'s identity and the information that might be gained from the informant was certainly relevant to the defendants\' theory, the defendants failed to establish its materiality.  The confidential informant provided no details ""beyond a threadbare rumor"" to support his allegation that Angelesco and Giangrande committed the murder.  Bonnett, 472 Mass. at 849.  The confidential informant was also not a percipient witness and had not learned the information from a percipient witness or the alleged killers.  Contrast id. (""At a minimum, the question whether the informant was a percipient witness to the shooting, or whether he had spoken to a percipient witness, should have been explored"").  Rather, the confidential informant was merely relaying inadmissible, immaterial ""word on the street"" information about the killing.  We conclude that the judge properly denied the defendants\' motion for disclosure of the confidential informant\'s identity.', '', '5.  Review under G. L. c. 278, § 33E.

The caller stated that ""they . . . had a hat on,"" and were wearing ""a jacket and a coat,"" one of which ""was gr[a]y and the other was black.""  The caller ""heard . . . one of them load the gun,"" and saw the men enter the building.  The caller said that ""there\'s always a little movement in that building,"" and acknowledged that she was ""not really sure what\'s going on.""  In addition, the caller stated that she was new to the neighborhood, and that she had not seen the men previously.  She provided the dispatcher with her home address, and the dispatcher indicated to the caller that he was aware of the caller\'s telephone number.', 'Page 606', 'A dispatcher subsequently issued the following report:  ""Any detective or any available north car [near the specified address], caller said she saw two Hispanic males enter a house, one in a gray jacket, one in a black jacket, the male was loading gun, was loading a cli[p] to a handgun.""', '', 'The motion judge credited that, during the general period in which the 911 call was made, the Lawrence police department was investigating a ""rash"" of ""home invasions"" believed to be the work of a ""crew"" from New York.  The judge noted, however, that the evidence did not indicate ""how recently or where"" the home invasions had occurred, or if any home invasion had ""occurred in the immediate vicinity or neighbor[hood] of"" the particular street.', 'Multiple police officers responded to the dispatch.  The address given was one of two numbers associated with a four-unit apartment building.  The building had a single front door, marked with the number ""5"" on the right side of the door and the number ""7"" on the left side of the door.  The building contained two apartments on the ground floor, numbered ""5A"" and ""7A,"" and two apartments on the upper floor, numbered ""5B"" and ""7B.""  At the rear of the building, there was a porch with two entrances.', 'Sergeant Michael Simard of the Lawrence police department was the supervising patrol sergeant that evening.  He arrived at the scene in a marked cruiser and was wearing a uniform.  Simard saw no one outside the building.  He and a number of other officers monitored the front entrance.', ""Sergeant Joseph Cerullo of the Lawrence police department's special operations division arrived at the scene in a marked cruiser; he, too, was wearing a uniform and a badge."", ""Cerullo and four other officers, including two members of the canine unit of the Essex County sheriff's department, moved to the rear of the building."", 'At the front of the building, Simard spoke to residents of unit 7A, the first-floor apartment located across the hall from unit 5A.  The residents of unit 7A denied seeing or hearing anything out of the ordinary, and said that they did not know who lived in unit 5A.

Simard commented that the residents of unit 7A were scared because of', 'Page 607', 'the ""[fifteen] police officers with their guns drawn.""  Simard also stated that, except for the residents of unit 7A, no residents of the building appeared to be at home.', 'After obtaining the telephone number of the 911 caller, Simard spoke with her by telephone.', 'The caller told Simard that she had seen three males whom she did not recognize talking on the front step of the building located at ""5-7"" on that street.  The caller stated that she had heard the sound of a ""rack"" being pulled back on a semiautomatic handgun,', 'a sound she recognized because she was ""from Lawrence.""

The man had facial hair and was ""wearing a black and gray sweater.""  He was identified at the evidentiary hearing as ""Wascar Bievenido Guerrero Diaz.""', 'With his firearm drawn, Cerullo shouted, ""Lawrence Police.  Show me your hands.""  From the front of the building, Simard was able to hear Cerullo.  Diaz appeared ""shocked"" and ""quickly went back inside"" the building, ""closing the door behind him.""  Cerullo and another officer attempted to enter the building through the door Diaz had used, but, as the judge determined, they ""found it locked.""', 'According to Cerullo, the door was associated with apartment ""number 5.""  Cerullo did not specify whether he was referring to apartment 5A, 5B, or both.', 'Cerullo moved to the front of the building to discuss the situation with Simard, while four officers remained at the rear of the building.  Focusing their attention on unit 5A, Cerullo and Simard made the decision to enter that unit without a warrant.', '', 'Within approximately three to eight minutes after police arrived at the scene, Cerullo ""entered the front door forcefully,"" and then led a number of officers through the front door of the building and into unit 5A.  Conducting a ""protective sweep"" for any injured persons and the Hispanic male he had seen earlier at the rear of the building, Cerullo moved through the living room toward the rear of the building.  Other officers searched different areas of the apartment.  They did not find any people, but they did observe in plain view what appeared to be illegal narcotics, a scale, and plastic bags strewn on the floor.  The officers did not seize anything at that point.', 'At the rear of the apartment, Cerullo encountered a door leading to a hallway outside unit 5A.  In the hallway, he saw another door.', 'Page 609', 'The officers believed that this was the door that Diaz had used minutes earlier.  Cerullo also saw a stairway leading up to unit 5B and down to a basement; a light was on in the basement.  After confirming the absence of any people inside unit 5A, Cerullo, other officers, and several canine unit dogs searched the basement; they found and arrested three individuals.  They did not search anywhere else in the building for the suspected home invaders.', 'Based on observations made during the warrantless search of unit 5A, officers obtained a search warrant.  Pursuant to the warrant, they searched unit 5A again and seized items from the apartment.', 'b.  Procedural history.

See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 213.  Second, after the entry, the conduct of the officers must be reasonable under the circumstances, id. at 216; in other words, the search must not exceed the scope of the emergency.  See Peters, supra.  ""Where these two conditions have been satisfied, warrantless entry into a home is permissible.""  Duncan, 467 Mass. at 751.  The ""burden rests with the Commonwealth to demonstrate that a warrantless search . . . fits within the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement.""  Entwistle, supra at 215, quoting Peters, supra.  See Snell, 428 Mass. at 774-775.', 'i.  Objectively reasonable belief.  To meet its burden, the Commonwealth first must demonstrate objectively reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed at the time of entry.  See Peters, 453 Mass. at 823.  See also Hill v.

In addition, because the entry is made ""to prevent harm stemming from a dangerous condition, not to investigate criminal activity,"" a reviewing court ""does not require that police have probable cause that a crime has been committed.""  Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585.  See Duncan, 467 Mass. at 750; Hill, 884 F.3d at 23.  It is sufficient where the totality of the circumstances demonstrates objectively reasonable grounds to believe that emergency assistance is needed to prevent imminent physical harm, to provide assistance to one who is injured, or to protect life or, in some circumstances, property.', 'See, e.g., Entwistle, supra at 214, 216.', 'ii.  Reasonableness of police conduct inside the dwelling.  To rely upon the emergency aid doctrine, the Commonwealth also must', 'Page 612', 'demonstrate that the conduct of the officers after they entered the premises was reasonable under the circumstances.  See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 216.  To be reasonable, the warrantless conduct of the officers inside the dwelling must be ""strictly circumscribed"" by the circumstances of the emergency that justified entry.  See Commonwealth v. Lewin (No. 1),', ', 622 (1990), quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 393 (1978).  Thus, a protective sweep made pursuant to the emergency aid exception ""must be limited in scope to its purpose,"" Peters, 453 Mass. at 823, e.g., to preventing imminent harm, protecting life or property,', 'or providing aid to one who is injured.', 'In addition, to be reasonable under the emergency aid doctrine, the officers\' conduct after entry ""may not be expanded into a general search for evidence of criminal activity.""

Therefore, if, after entry, officers no longer have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency exists, it is unreasonable to continue searching.  See Mincey, 437 U.S. at 393 (warrantless search was unreasonable when conducted after officers had located all persons in dwelling during prior protective sweep); Commonwealth v. Kaeppeler,', ', 403 (2015) (""continued police presence in the defendant\'s home without his consent after he was transported to the hospital for medical treatment and the subsequent seizure of [evidence in plain view] was unreasonable,"" because emergency concerning ""the defendant\'s well-being had ended,"" and evidence was seized for ""an investigative purpose""); Peters, 453 Mass. at 820 (warrantless search of dwelling was unconstitutional after protective sweep eliminated objectively reasonable basis to believe that emergency existed).', 'After completing a protective sweep, however, if officers continue to have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency exists, a subsequent sweep that is limited to the scope of the emergency may be justified.  See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 215-219 (two instances of law enforcement entry coupled with protective sweeps were justified under emergency aid exception, because each was supported by objectively reasonable bases to believe that emergency existed, and officers\' conduct during each sweep was reasonably limited to scope of emergency at hand); Peters, 453 Mass. at 825 (""We do not declare a \'one sweep rule\'"" . . .).', 'Page 613', 'Undoubtedly, when officers have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency exists, and they reasonably circumscribe the scope of their conduct after entry, ""[e]vidence observed in plain view may be seized,"" Peters, 453 Mass. at 823, provided that the officers ""have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made,"" King, 563 U.S. at 463; the ""incriminating character"" of the evidence is ""immediately apparent"" (citation omitted), Kaeppeler, 473 Mass. at 405; and the evidence actually is in plain view.  See, e.g., Hicks, 480 U.S. at 324-325, 328 (""a truly cursory inspection -- one that involves merely looking at what is already exposed to view, without disturbing it -- is not a \'search\' for Fourth Amendment purposes,"" but disturbing or moving objects in plain view constitutes ""a \'search\'"" for which warrant is required); Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 217 (observation of content of printed bill fell within scope of emergency aid exception where ""[t]he officer did not open a bill still in its envelope or search for it in a file or drawer; he merely read what was in plain view from an already opened bill that lay on the kitchen table"").', 'With these considerations in mind, we turn to the search at issue.', 'iii.  Initial search of unit 5A and basement.  The defendant maintains that the officers who entered unit 5A and the basement without a warrant lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed.  The Commonwealth, for its part, acknowledges an ""absence of precedent"" justifying the officers\' warrantless entry under the emergency aid doctrine.', 'As the motion judge noted, the ""Commonwealth\'s claim that the officers had reason for concern that an armed man was present inside the apartment building is not completely without merit.""  ""[P]olice need not wait for screams from within in order to fear for the safety of occupants or themselves.""  United States v. Lenoir, 318 F.3d 725, 730 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 841 (2003).  Entry into unit 5A pursuant to the emergency aid exception, however, required an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency existed.  See, e.g., Fisher, 558 U.S. at 47; Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585.  The totality of the circumstances at the time of the entry into unit 5A did not support such a basis.', 'When the officers arrived at the scene in response to the 911 call, they saw and heard no signs of disturbance, and detected no signs of forced entry.  To the contrary, they observed that the doors to the building, and to unit 5A, were closed and intact.  Moreover, when Simard spoke with the 911 caller, she said that the men had', 'Page 614', 'entered the building ""easily,"" because they likely had a key.  The officers interviewed residents of unit 7A and learned that the residents, too, had seen and heard nothing suspicious or out of the ordinary.  No one else informed the officers of any commotion, noises, or sounds coming from unit 5A.  As the motion judge found, the officers had no knowledge of any residents or victims inside unit 5A, and the only residents of any unit the officers knew were present were the unharmed residents of unit 7A.', 'The fact that Diaz was observed at the back of the building does not transform the situation into an emergency.  There was no indication that he was injured, in need of emergency assistance, armed, or about to harm others, or that he had harmed others.', 'Regardless of whether the officers had sincerely held beliefs as to the existence of an armed home invasion or hostage situation, their subjective beliefs at the scene cannot justify a search under the emergency aid exception.  See, e.g., Stuart, 547 U.S. at 404; Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 214.  The totality of the circumstances at the time of entry here did not establish a reasonable basis to believe that an emergency existed in unit 5A.', 'See Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585-587.  Therefore, the warrantless search was not justified under the emergency aid exception.', 'Our analysis does not end there, however.  We turn to consider whether the entry was justified for some other reason, i.e., under the probable cause and exigent circumstances exception.', 'b.  Probable cause and exigent circumstances exception.  The judge concluded that, under the exigent circumstances doctrine, the facts confronting the officers did not establish the existence of an exigency, or probable cause of an armed home invasion or hostage situation in progress.', 'Pursuant to both art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment, the exigent circumstances doctrine establishes another ""well-recognized,"" King, 563 U.S. at 460, yet ""narrow"" exception to the warrant requirement, see Tyree, 455 Mass. at 691.  See also Commonwealth v. Young,', ', 456 (1981) (""Exigencies which may justify a procedure', 'Page 615', 'without warrant are a narrow category and must be established by the Commonwealth . . .""); Commonwealth v. Forde,', ', 800 (1975) (""the standards as to exigency are strict"").', '""In the absence of a warrant, two conditions must be met in order for a nonconsensual entry to be valid"" under the exigent circumstances doctrine:  (1) ""there must be probable cause"" and (2) ""there must be exigent circumstances.""  Commonwealth v. DeJesus,', ', 619 (2003).  See Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 211-212.  In this way, ""[t]he exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement may be more appropriately denominated the exception for probable cause', 'exigent circumstances"" (emphasis in original).

Louisiana, 536 U.S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (""police officers need either a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances in order to make a lawful entry into a home"").  Put differently, when probable cause exists to believe that a crime has occurred, is occurring, or will occur imminently, warrantless entry is justified only if exigent circumstances also are present.  See Figueroa, supra at 213.  Conversely, without probable cause, the existence of an exigency is insufficient to permit warrantless entry into a dwelling.  See id.', 'The Commonwealth ""bears the burden of proof"" to establish that a warrantless search was proper.  See Young, 382 Mass. at 456.  See also Tyree, 455 Mass. at 684 (""Given the high value that our Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions assign to the warrant requirement, particularly in relation to a dwelling, we impose a heavy burden on the Commonwealth to justify every warrantless search:  in the absence of consent, the Commonwealth must prove both probable cause to enter the dwelling and the existence of exigent circumstances"" [footnote omitted]).', 'When entry is lawful under the exigent circumstances doctrine, ""the police, in accordance with the rule of \'plain view,\' [may] take into their possession material having apparent evidential connection to the criminal activity they were in course of investigating"" (footnote omitted).

Washington,', ', 485 (2007).', 'In the circumstances here, for the same reasons that the officers lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe that residents of unit 5A were in danger, pursuant to the emergency aid doctrine, the officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe that they or others were at risk of imminent harm, pursuant to the exigent circumstances doctrine.  See Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 213.  At the scene, officers encountered no indications of violence or forced entry.  They were unaware of any resident or victim inside unit 5A.  Indeed, the only residents known to officers, those of unit 7A, were unharmed, and had neither seen nor heard anything suspicious.  In addition, when Diaz was seen at the rear of the building, there was no indication that he, the police, or anyone else was at risk of imminent injury.  We therefore agree with the motion judge', 'Page 617', 'that there was ""nothing indicative of an imminent threat of danger to persons inside the building or to the officers.""', ""In addition, because the building was surrounded by officers, there was little risk of a suspect's flight from within.

Thus, the 911 caller claimed to have seen and heard what could have been criminal activity.', 'The more difficult question, however, is whether the officers had an adequate basis to conclude that the 911 caller\'s tip was reliable.  In this regard, the caller provided details adverse to a determination of probable cause.  She commented that the men talked calmly before entering the building, which they entered ""easily"" because they likely had a key.

Turning first to the evidence concerning Koester\'s failed proficiency tests, the parties dispute whether this evidence was known to the Commonwealth before the March 2012 trial.  The defendant relies on an affidavit submitted by his DNA expert, and maintains that ""an accredited forensic laboratory"" would have known before trial that Koester had failed the proficiency tests.  According to the expert, laboratories typically evaluate tests before the results are finalized and reported to the forensic scientist.  He opined that ""the information regarding the failed . . .  proficiency tests was available to the [State] laboratory by the beginning of 2012, well before the March 2012 trial.""  Thus, the defendant argues, he is entitled to a new trial because the Commonwealth failed to provide exculpatory evidence in its possession prior to the time of trial.', ""The Commonwealth contends that the information concerning Koester's test results was not in its possession or control at the time of trial, because the information did not come into existence until after the defendant's trial.  The Commonwealth argues accordingly that, at most, the information regarding Koester should be considered newly discovered evidence.  See Commonwealth v. Clemente,"", ', 312 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1181 (2009) (""obligation to disclose exculpatory information is limited to that in the possession of the prosecutor or police"" [citation omitted]).  Although Koester was required to complete the tests in 2010 and 2011, the Commonwealth argues, the tests were not graded until May 2012, a few months after the trial from March 15 through March 30, 2012.', 'In ""March of 2012, [however, Koester] became the subject of an ongoing corrective action by Lab Management, due to deficiencies', 'Page 650', 'identified during the annual proficiency testing program.""', 'That the State police took ""corrective action"" against Koester in March of 2012 appears to indicate that the Commonwealth, through the State police, was aware of his deficient performance at least before the end of the defendant\'s trial.  Regardless of whether the prosecutor was aware of the test results at any point during the trial, the defendant is unable to establish a reasonable possibility that the evidence would have made a difference in the jury\'s verdict.  See Commonwealth v.

The judge's finding that Koester played a relatively minor role in the criminal investigation against the defendant is supported by the trial record.  Koester responded to the crime scene, marked the location of evidence, and performed a bloodstain pattern analysis that was not central to the case.  Later that day, Koester swabbed the defendant's hands at the police station.  The swabs were submitted to another scientist for DNA testing.  Although Koester officially supervised the two criminalists who searched the defendant's apartment, Koester was not present when they recovered the defendant's sneakers, and he did not test the sneakers for the presence of blood or DNA.

We turn to the defendant's contention that he is entitled to a new trial because the crime lab has revised the method it uses to calculate the probability of random matches in cases involving both STR and Y-STR results."", 'At trial, the DNA analyst testified that the STR profile obtained from the fingernail clippings of the victim\'s right hand was a mixture of at least two individuals, and that the victim\'s DNA matched the major profile.  The defendant was included as a potential contributor to the minor profile.  The analyst testified further that the Y-STR results revealed DNA from at least three males.  The defendant\'s DNA (and that of his paternal relatives) matched the major profile of the Y-STR profile, and Oliver\'s DNA (and that of his paternal relatives) matched the minor profile.  The analyst then explained that she had calculated the probabilities of the STR and Y-STR profiles found on the victim\'s right fingernails by ""tak[ing] the statistic for the STR results . . . multiplied by the statistic for the Y-STR results. . . .""  Based on this method, the analyst testified, the probability of a randomly selected unrelated individual having the same STR and Y-STR profile was one in 326,900 of the Caucasian population, one in 423,000 of the African-American population, and one in 118,900 of the Hispanic population.', 'After trial, the crime lab issued a ""Corrected DNA STR/Y-STR Report"" that eliminated the original ""combined STR and Y-STR', 'Page 652', 'frequency data (i.e. combined statistic)"" from the report.  According to the revised calculation, the probability of a randomly selected individual having contributed to the STR DNA mixture found on the fingernail cuttings from the victim\'s right hand was one in 307 of the Caucasian population, one in 452 of the African-American population, and one in 212 of the Hispanic population.  The Y-STR DNA from the same sample matched the defendant (and his paternal relatives) with a ratio of one in 1,065 for the Caucasian population, one in 936 for the African-American population, and one in 561 for the Hispanic population.', 'We agree with the defendant\'s DNA expert that the difference between the original and corrected match probabilities is ""statistically significant.""  In the circumstances of this case, however, the revised probability calculations do not cast doubt on the justice of the conviction.  The newly reported STR and Y-STR statistics were less damaging, but not exculpatory.  Contrast Commonwealth v. Cameron,', ', 104-110 (2015) (newly discovered DNA evidence bolstered argument that DNA test results presented at trial were erroneous); Commonwealth v. Cowels,', "", 620 (2015) (outcome of trial might have been different because new DNA testing contradicted evidence that Commonwealth used to corroborate key witness).  Moreover, the value of the revised statistics must be considered in light of the other DNA evidence introduced at trial connecting the defendant to the crime.  This evidence includes a blood stain found on the defendant's left sneaker which matched the victim's DNA profile, with probabilities of one in 14.96 quintillion of the Caucasian population, one in 3.26 septillion of the African-American population, and one in 9.443 quintillion of the Hispanic population."", ""b.  Sufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the murder conviction.  He argues that the evidence, at best, established that he had had a prior relationship with the victim.  According to the defendant, in denying his motion for a directed verdict, the judge failed to take into account several pieces of exculpatory evidence including that the defendant's roommates did not hear him leave the apartment the night of the stabbing; the police searched his apartment and vehicles and did not recover the murder weapon; he and the victim had ended their relationship amicably; and others had a motive to kill the victim, such as Oliver or an unknown strip club patron."", 'We rely on the familiar Latimore standard in determining whether the Commonwealth met its burden to establish each element of the', 'Page 653', 'offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.

After a two-day evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant's motion to suppress.

In attempting to locate Dorisca, Detective Kenneth Williams of the Brockton police department spoke with Dorisca's best friend, Cassio Vertil."", 'Cassio admitted that he had spoken with Dorisca within a day of the homicide.  After Cassio gave his cellular telephone number to the police, Williams examined records connected to the telephone, which confirmed that calls had indeed been made after the shooting to a cellular telephone belonging to Dorisca.', 'Williams recognized Cassio from a videotape recorded months before the homicide that showed Cassio and another person discussing the movement of drugs from Florida to Massachusetts.  Williams testified that ""the tape clearly displays [Cassio] . . . engaged in what seems to be very lucrative drug dealings . . .  And bragging and boasting of going to Florida to obtain more drugs.  And they\'re flashing tens of thousands of dollars on this tape.""', ""On July 2, 2008, Williams spoke with Cassio's brother, Kennel,"", 'Page 73', 'who said that Cassio was now using a different cellular telephone and provided Williams with the new telephone number.  Kennel also stated that Cassio was traveling to New York in a brown Toyota RAV-4 motor vehicle with individuals nicknamed ""Paco"" and ""Paquito.""  Williams knew that Paco was the defendant in this case and that Paquito was Stephen Allonce.  State troopers also learned from a confidential informant that Cassio was traveling to Florida in the brown Toyota to purchase narcotics.  There was little information offered at the hearings regarding the reliability or veracity of this confidential informant.  State police Trooper Eric Telford testified that he had not used this informant in the past, but Williams characterized the informant as ""reliable,"" without explaining the basis of this characterization.', 'That same day, July 2, the Commonwealth sought and obtained a court order, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) (2006), to require the cellular service provider to produce records for the cellular telephone that Cassio was now using.  Under § 2703(d), a court may order a telephone company to produce records, including CSLI records, ""if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the . . . records or other information sought . . . are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.""  In addition to subscriber information, the court order required, for the period from July 1 through July 6 (later extended to July 8), the production of records of cell sites utilized for telephone calls, toll records for calls made or received, and ""updates on the phone\'s location every fifteen . . . minutes.""', 'On July 2, the cellular service provider furnished Williams with records showing that the defendant was the subscriber for this cellular telephone, and that the defendant resided in an apartment in Brockton (residence).  The cellular service provider used ""ping"" technology to send radio signals to the cellular phone and record the approximate location of the cell sites or cell towers with which the telephone communicated, and sent the resulting CSLI records by e-mail to Williams.  Those records indicated that the telephone had traveled south from Randolph and eventually had come to a stop in Sunrise, Florida.', 'Williams then requested the assistance of the local police in Florida, who used the CSLI data to track down the brown Toyota vehicle and observed Cassio, the defendant, and Allonce staying together at a motel.  The local police did not identify any of the men as Dorisca.', 'Page 74', ""On July 7, 2008, the CSLI records indicated that the cellular telephone was traveling north toward Massachusetts.  In response, the police began surveillance at the defendant's residence and also at Cassio's home in Randolph.  At approximately 2:15 p.m. on July 8, the police observed the brown Toyota vehicle parked at the defendant's residence and saw Cassio standing outside with another person who appeared to match the description of Dorisca.  Cassio then drove away in the vehicle with Allonce as a passenger.  Two State police troopers followed them and stopped the vehicle after it had traveled a few blocks; they observed that the vehicle contained clothing, luggage, and a cooler.  Cassio told the troopers that he had just left Paco's house and was heading to the police station in Brockton to meet with Williams regarding the homicide.  Cassio and Allonce then drove to the Brockton police station; the last report of the cellular service provider regarding the cellular telephone's location at approximately 3:47 p.m. that day indicated that the telephone was located inside the vehicle at the Brockton police station."", 'The State police troopers returned to the residence to look for Dorisca and speak to the defendant.  After approaching the building, they encountered two residents of the first-floor apartment.  The troopers stated that they were looking for a homicide suspect, and the residents consented to a search of their unit.  After the troopers looked through the unit, they left through a back door into a rear entry area and walked up the stairs to the second floor.  The resident of that unit also consented to a search of her unit.  The troopers then continued up the rear stairway to the third floor, which led to an open landing area with several doors that led to two bedrooms, a storage area, and a crawl space.  All but one of the doors were open.', 'The troopers knocked on the closed door and the defendant answered, identifying himself as ""Paco.""  He stated that he resided in one of the third-floor bedrooms and paid $400 per month in rent to use that space.  Trooper Francis Walls informed the defendant that police were investigating a homicide and that the murder suspect might be in the building.  He also said that the investigation involved illegal narcotics.', 'Telford advised the defendant of his Miranda rights and explained that they were looking for a homicide suspect, and had information that the defendant ""had just gone down to Florida and purchased a large amount of narcotics and . . . [was] possibly storing it there.""  The defendant said that he had just driven back', 'Page 75', 'from Florida with some friends, denied possessing drugs, and signed a form giving his consent for a search.  During that search, the police found $2,200 in cash in the defendant\'s bedroom and, after the arrival of a narcotics-trained dog, a pillowcase in the attic crawl space across from the defendant\'s bedroom containing two ""bricks"" of cocaine.  After the defendant was indicted, he moved to suppress the fruits of the search.', 'The third motion judge determined that the defendant had standing to challenge the CSLI tracking of the cellular telephone because, although the telephone was used by Cassio, the police knew that the defendant was traveling with Cassio, and ""[t]hey intended to track the movements of all three occupants of the vehicle because they had information that the purpose of the trip was to obtain cocaine for distribution in Massachusetts.""  The judge also concluded that the cocaine seized during the search of the defendant\'s residence ""was found as a result of the unlawful electronic tracking,"" and ""[t]he search and seizure was not attenuated from the unlawful tracking by lapse of time, intervening circumstances or by another legitimate police purpose in conducting the search.""  The judge therefore ruled that the evidence obtained during the search must be suppressed as ""fruit of the poisonous tree.""', ""A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth's motion for an interlocutory appeal and reported the appeal to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in  422 Mass. 1501  (1996).  The Appeals Court agreed with the motion judge's conclusions on both standing and attenuation, but ultimately held that the warrantless search of the crawl space where the cocaine was found was permissible because the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in that area.  Fredericq, 93 Mass. App. Ct. at 30-31.  On this ground alone, the Appeals Court reversed the allowance of the motion to suppress with respect to the cocaine, and affirmed it in all other respects.

In reviewing a judge\'s decision on a motion to suppress, we ""make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\'s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.""

Ct. 2206, 2220 (2018) (government acquisition of CSLI records constitutes ""a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution]"").  The Commonwealth concedes that the CSLI tracking of the cellular telephone in this case was unlawful because it was not authorized by a search warrant.  But the Commonwealth argues that the motion to suppress should nonetheless have been denied because (1) the defendant had no standing to challenge the tracking of a cellular telephone that was registered in his name, but used solely by Cassio; (2) as the Appeals Court concluded, the cocaine was not seized during a constitutional search because the defendant lacked any expectation of privacy in the crawl space where it was found; and (3) the evidence obtained during the search was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal tracking because of the defendant\'s consent to the search, thus ""purging"" the search of its taint.  We will discuss these issues in turn.', '1.  Standing.  A defendant has standing to challenge a search and seizure under art. 14 if he or she ""has a possessory interest in the place searched or in the property seized or if [he or she] was present when the search occurred.""  Commonwealth v. Williams,', ', 208 (2009).  Here, the defendant was the subscriber of the cellular telephone, but the third motion judge found that Cassio was the person who was using that telephone.  The defendant claims that he has standing on three separate and distinct grounds:  first, because he was a passenger in the vehicle whose location was being tracked through the CSLI monitoring of the cellular telephone; second, because he was the registered owner of the telephone, and therefore had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location of that telephone; and third, because he had a property interest in the telephone that was interfered with when the police pinged the telephone, thereby drawing power from its battery.  We need not address whether the second and third grounds independently would suffice to grant standing,', 'Page 77', 'because we conclude that the defendant has standing as a passenger of the vehicle whose location was effectively being continually tracked through CSLI monitoring of the target telephone.', 'In Commonwealth v. Rousseau,', ', 382 (2013), we declared that ""under art. 14, a person may reasonably expect not to be subjected to extended [global positioning system (GPS)] electronic surveillance by the government, targeted at his movements, without judicial oversight and a showing of probable cause.""  We thus held that a passenger with no possessory interest in a vehicle has standing to challenge the extended GPS surveillance of the vehicle as an invasion of his or her own reasonable expectation of privacy.  Id.  See United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 415-416 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (""GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\'s public movements . . . [and] evades the ordinary checks that constrain abusive law enforcement practices.""); Commonwealth v. Connolly,', ', 833 (2009) (Gants, J., concurring) (""the appropriate constitutional concern is not the protection of property but rather the protection of the reasonable expectation of privacy"").', ""With respect to the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy, the CSLI tracking of the cellular telephone in this case implicates the same constitutional concerns as the GPS surveillance of the vehicle in Rousseau.  See Augustine, 467 Mass. at 254.  Indeed, in Augustine, we noted that the type of prospective CSLI tracking that largely took place here -- as opposed to historical CSLI tracking -- is even more closely akin to direct GPS surveillance."", 'Id. at 254 n.36.  The CSLI search was ""targeted at [the defendant\'s] movements,"" much as the GPS search was targeted at the passenger defendant in Rousseau, because the police knew when they obtained the § 2703(d) order that the defendant was traveling out of State with Cassio in the same vehicle.  Rousseau, 465 Mass. at 382.  They then sought and obtained updates on the vehicle\'s location every fifteen minutes for at least six consecutive days.  For all practical purposes, the CSLI monitoring', 'Page 78', ""of the cellular telephone tracked the defendant's location when he was in the vehicle in much the same way as would GPS tracking of that vehicle.  Accordingly, the defendant here has standing to challenge the CSLI search and any resulting fruits of that search."", '2.  The search of the crawl space as fruit of the poisonous tree.  Under what has become known as the ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" doctrine, the exclusionary rule bars the use of evidence derived from an unconstitutional search or seizure.  See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963) (defining ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" as evidence that ""has been come at by exploitation of"" unlawful search or seizure); Commonwealth v. Damiano,', ', 453 (2005).  In determining whether evidence derived from an illegal search or seizure must be suppressed, ""the issue is not whether \'but for\' the prior illegality the evidence would not have been obtained, but \'whether . . . the evidence . . . has been come at by exploitation of [that] illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\'""  Id., quoting Commonwealth v. Bradshaw,', ', 258 (1982).  ""It is the Commonwealth\'s burden to establish that the evidence it has obtained and intends to use is sufficiently attenuated from the underlying illegality so as to be purged from its taint.""  Damiano, supra at 454.  ""[T]he attenuation doctrine is not an exception to the exclusionary rule, but rather a test of its limits.""  R.G. Stearns, Massachusetts Criminal Law:  A District Court Prosecutor\'s Guide 172 (38th ed. 2018).', 'The Commonwealth contends, and the Appeals Court concluded, see Fredericq, 93 Mass. App. Ct. at 30-31, that the cocaine found in the crawl space should not be suppressed even if it has failed to meet its burden of proving attenuation because the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the crawl space.  We disagree.  Evidence may be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree even if it is found in a place where the defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy.  This principle is as old as the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine itself.  In Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 474, 486-487, the defendant made statements to the police indicating that a codefendant had drugs at his home.  The United States Supreme Court held that those statements should have been', 'Page 79', 'suppressed because they arose out of an unlawful arrest and that their admission would thus violate the defendant\'s Fourth Amendment rights.  Id. at 484, 486-487.  The Court further concluded that the drugs found at the codefendant\'s home should have been suppressed, even though the defendant did not suggest that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the codefendant\'s home, because the drugs were the fruit of a poisonous tree -- the unlawful arrest.  Id. at 487-488.  The only relevant factor that the Court considered was whether the police ""exploit[ed]"" the ""illegality"" of the unlawful arrest; that alone was sufficient to require the suppression of the drugs.  Id. at 488.  See id. at 487 (""The prosecutor candidly told the trial court that \'we wouldn\'t have found those drugs except that [the defendant] helped us to\'"").', 'Other courts interpreting the Fourth Amendment have arrived at the same conclusion.  See United States v. Olivares-Rangel, 458 F.3d 1104, 1117-1118 (10th Cir. 2006) (""the law imposes no separate standing requirement regarding the evidence which constitutes the fruit of [the] poisonous tree""); United States v. Green, 275 F.3d 694, 699 (8th Cir. 2001) (although defendant lacked possessory or property interest in searched motor vehicle, ""he may still . . . seek to suppress evidence as the fruit of his illegal detention""); Jones v. United States, 168 A.3d 703, 722-723 (D.C. 2017) (defendant\'s expectation of privacy in another person\'s purse ""not a material consideration in the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree analysis"").  See generally 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure:  A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 11.4, at 325-326 (5th ed. 2012) (LaFave) (""If the defendant does have standing with respect to the poisonous tree, that alone suffices"" to challenge admissibility of its fruits).', 'Nor is the exclusionary rule under art. 14 limited in scope to contraband or evidence seized in a place where the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy; art. 14\'s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures forbids the introduction of all evidence ""sufficiently intimate"" with those unlawful acts.  See Damiano, 444 Mass. at 453-454, quoting Commonwealth v. Sylvia,', ', 183 (1980).  For that reason, we have repeatedly held that persons subjected to an illegal seizure were entitled to suppress the fruits of that seizure even where the evidence was discovered in places where it is indisputable that the person in question did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  See Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 587 (2010) (concluding that even though ""[n]o one has a reasonable expectation of privacy in items retrieved from the ground on a public park,"" evidence of drugs dropped in park could nonetheless be ""suppressed as the fruit of an unconstitutional seizure . . . if [a] stop', 'Page 80', 'were not supported by reasonable suspicion"").  See also Commonwealth v. Warren,', "", 533, 540 (2016) (vacating denial of motion to suppress where firearm found in yard following unlawful seizure of defendant nearby without reasonable suspicion); Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin,"", ', 998-1000 (1988) (reversing denial of motion to suppress where defendant abandoned jacket containing narcotics in parking garage while being pursued by police without reasonable suspicion for stop).', 'We conclude, therefore, that to spare the cocaine from suppression, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving attenuation even if the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the crawl space of his residence where the cocaine was found.', '', '3.  Attenuation.  The Commonwealth contends that it has met its burden to establish sufficient attenuation because the causal chain between the illegal CSLI search -- the ""poisonous tree"" -- and the subsequent discovery of the cocaine -- the ""fruits"" -- was broken by the defendant\'s consent to the search of his residence.  We agree that, under certain circumstances, a defendant\'s voluntary consent to a search of his residence may be an intervening event that constitutes adequate attenuation, thus allowing the evidence found during the search to be admitted in evidence.  For instance, in Damiano, 444 Mass. at 456, 459, where the defendant voluntarily consented to a search of his home after he learned that the police had secured the premises with his wife and child present and that the police intended to obtain a search warrant, we concluded that the consent was an intervening event that sufficed to prove adequate attenuation from the illegal interception of the defendant\'s communications by a private citizen.', 'But a defendant\'s consent to search, like a defendant\'s consent to waive his or her right to silence after being given Miranda warnings, does not automatically attenuate the taint of an illegality.  See Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 602-603 (1975) (""If Miranda', 'Page 81', 'warnings, by themselves, were held to attenuate the taint of an unconstitutional arrest, . . . the effect of the exclusionary rule would be substantially diluted"").  A defendant\'s consent to a search cannot constitute adequate attenuation where the consent itself is tainted by the illegality because it was obtained through exploitation of the fruits of the illegal search.  See Commonwealth v. Midi,', ', 595 (1999) (""When consent to search is obtained through exploitation of a prior illegality, particularly very close in time following the prior illegality, the . . . compromised consent has been thought to be tainted and inadmissible"").  See also Brown, supra at 603 (where defendant made admissions after unlawful arrest, attenuation depends on whether defendant ""act[ed] of [his or her] free will unaffected by the initial illegality""); Estabrook, 472 Mass. at 864-865 (where defendant was confronted with evidence obtained from CSLI in close proximity to illegality, statements made in direct response must be suppressed); Commonwealth v. Fielding,', ', 113 (1976) (defendant\'s statements may be ""fatally infected"" where ""the connection between the illegality and the making of the statements is sufficiently intimate"").', ""In determining whether the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving that the defendant's consent was not tainted by evidence obtained from the illegal CSLI search, we consider three factors:  (1) the amount of time that elapsed between the defendant being confronted with the illegally obtained CSLI evidence and his grant of consent; (2) the presence of any intervening circumstances during that time period;"", 'and (3) ""the purpose and', 'Page 82', 'flagrancy of the official misconduct.""  See Damiano, 444 Mass. at 455, citing Kaupp v. Texas, 538 U.S. 626, 633 (2003) (per curiam).  See also Commonwealth v. Tuschall,', ', 589 (2017); United States v. Shetler, 665 F.3d 1150, 1159 (9th Cir. 2011).', 'As to the first and second factors, the defendant\'s consent was obtained immediately after Telford informed him that the police knew he ""had', 'gone down to Florida and purchased a large amount of narcotics and . . . [was] possibly storing it there"" (emphasis added), information that was intimately intertwined with the information gleaned from the unlawful CSLI tracking.  The temporal proximity between the trooper confronting the defendant with information obtained through the illegal CSLI tracking and the defendant\'s grant of consent to search, and the absence of intervening events between that confrontation and his consent, weigh heavily in favor of the motion judge\'s conclusion that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proving that it did not exploit the illegally obtained information in obtaining the consent to search.  See Estabrook, 472 Mass. at 865 (finding no attenuation between illegal CSLI search and defendant\'s statement because ""there were no intervening circumstances between the police questions based on the CSLI and [defendant\'s] responses thereto""); Shetler, 665 F.3d at 1159 (concluding that there was ""causal connection between the illegal searches and [defendant\'s] statements, particularly because [government] agents may have confronted [defendant] with illegally seized evidence during the interview"").  Although we can never know the reason why the defendant consented to the search, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the grant of consent was influenced by the information Telford had just told him, which might have caused him to believe that the refusal to consent would be futile because it would simply trigger an application for a search warrant of his home.  See Shetler, supra at 1158 (""the answers the suspect gives to officials questioning him may be influenced by his knowledge that the officials had already seized certain evidence"").  See generally LaFave, supra at § 11.4(c), at 401 (""Confronting', 'Page 83', 'a suspect with illegally seized evidence tends to induce a confession by demonstrating the futility of remaining silent"" [citation omitted]).', ""The Commonwealth argues that the defendant's consent was not influenced by the fruits of the illegal CSLI search because the police had independently learned -- apart from the CSLI tracking -- that the defendant lived at the residence and that he had just returned from a drug deal in Florida.  It contends that the police knew from Kennel that the defendant was going to New York in the brown Toyota vehicle with Cassio, knew from a confidential informant that Cassio was traveling to Florida to purchase drugs, knew from stopping the vehicle after the defendant had just been dropped off at his residence that they had just returned from an extended trip, and knew from the defendant that he had been in Florida."", 'But nothing about Kennel\'s statement to the police suggested that the defendant was going beyond New York.  And the confidential informant\'s tip did not mention the defendant and gave the police no information about when Cassio would return.  The police began to monitor the defendant\'s residence only when they learned from the CSLI that the vehicle in which he was riding was about to enter Massachusetts.  They stopped the vehicle only because the physical surveillance -- triggered by what the police learned from the CSLI -- spotted Cassio and a person they thought might be Dorisca leaving the residence.  And the police entered the multiunit house and sought the defendant\'s consent to search his residence only because they knew from the CSLI that Cassio and the defendant had just returned from Florida and that the defendant might be in possession of the drugs that he and Cassio were believed to have purchased.  See United States v. Finucan, 708 F.2d 838, 843 (1st Cir. 1983) (government ""impermissibly exploited illegally seized material"" when it ""relied upon information obtained from the seized documents in guiding [its] investigation"").  Therefore, we conclude that Telford\'s statement to the defendant that the police knew he ""had just gone down to Florida and purchased a large amount of narcotics and . . . [was] possibly storing it there"" was derived from the poisonous CSLI tree and was not independently derived information.', 'As to the third factor -- ""the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct"" -- we recognize that the illegal police misconduct here was neither purposeful nor flagrant.  The police obtained judicial approval for the CSLI search pursuant to 18 U.S.C.', 'Page 84', '§ 2703(d) in 2008, six years before our decision in Augustine declared that CSLI could be obtained only through a search warrant supported by probable cause.  We declared in Augustine, 467 Mass. at 257, that ""this opinion clearly announces a new rule,"" noting that ""neither the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), nor our cases have previously suggested that police must obtain a search warrant in addition to a § 2703(d) order before obtaining an individual\'s CSLI from his or her cellular service provider.""', 'Although this factor favors the Commonwealth, it is not dispositive.  See Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 589 (concluding that ""[t]he balance of the [attenuation] factors . . . favors the defendant"" in suppression analysis even though ""there was no misconduct"" by police).  We do not recognize a ""good faith"" exception to either the exclusionary rule or the attenuation doctrine.', 'See Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 533 (2010) (""We have not adopted the \'good faith\' exception [to exclusionary rule]', 'Page 85', 'for purposes of art. 14 . . .""); Commonwealth v. Upton,', ', 370 & n.5 (1985) (G. L. c. 276, §§ 1, 2A, and 2B, ""bar any judicial consideration of admitting evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant issued without a showing of probable cause, even if the officer executing the warrant was proceeding in objectively reasonable reliance on the warrant"").  In Estabrook, 472 Mass. at 854, 864-865, where the CSLI also was obtained before our Augustine decision, we suppressed a defendant\'s statements to police where the statements were made ""in close proximity to the illegality, and there were no intervening circumstances between the police questions based on the CSLI and [the defendant\'s] responses thereto.""  The facts of this case compel the same result.  Contrast Damiano, 444 Mass. at 458 (where illegal interception was done by private citizen rather than police in violation of Federal wiretap statute, ""the complete lack of police involvement in the underlying illegal interception is not an insignificant fact in assessing the necessary reach of the exclusionary rule and the adequacy of the attenuating circumstances"").', ""In sum, we agree with the motion judge that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proving that it did not exploit the illegally obtained CSLI in obtaining the defendant's consent to search, where that consent was intimately intertwined -- both temporally and causally -- with the information gleaned from the unlawful CSLI tracking and was obtained immediately after Telford confronted the defendant with that information."", ""Conclusion.  The order of the Superior Court judge granting the defendant's motion to suppress is affirmed."", 'So ordered.', '', 'While the court\'s outcome is legally correct under present law, I appreciate the call, in Justice Cypher\'s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, for Massachusetts to recognize a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  As Justice Cypher\'s opinion emphasizes, ""The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future police misconduct by barring, in a current prosecution, the admission of evidence that the police have obtained in violation of rights protected by the Federal and State Constitutions.""  Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 578 (2015).  See Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 236-237 (2011); United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 909', 'Page 86', '(1984).  There is no deterrent value in suppressing evidence ""when the police act with an objectively \'reasonable good-faith belief\' that their conduct is lawful.""  Davis, supra at 238, quoting Leon, supra.  On the other hand, there is value in the certainty that a constitutional violation will have consequences.', 'However, since Massachusetts has never recognized the ""good faith"" exception, Commonwealth v. Valerio,', ', 569 (2007), adopting this exception to the exclusionary rule would be a significant departure from our present jurisprudence.  Such a departure, in my opinion, should not be made in a situation where neither party raised the issue, either below or before this court.  So although I recognize the potential benefits to adopting a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in the Commonwealth, such a major question would be best answered after both sides to the argument are presented to the court and we determine whether to adopt or reject such a change after due consideration.', '', ""The Commonwealth concedes that the cell site location information (CSLI) tracking of Cassio Vertil's (Cassio's) cellular telephone (cell phone) was unlawful because it was not authorized by a search warrant.  It argues, however, that the defendant did not have standing to challenge the unlawful tracking.  I agree with the court that under Commonwealth v. Rousseau,"", "", 382 (2013), the defendant has standing to challenge the search of Cassio's cell phone because his movements were tracked for six days."", 'Because the electronic tracking of the cell phone was', 'Page 87', ""ongoing while police searched the defendant's apartment and there was no temporal break between the unlawful police activity and the search of the defendant's apartment, I also agree that the defendant's consent to search his apartment was not attenuated from the police's illegal conduct.  See Commonwealth v. Gentile,"", ', 831 (2014).  And I agree, albeit not based on the Massachusetts support cited by the court, that the fruits of that search -- the cocaine -- must be suppressed, even though the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the crawl space.', 'See Jones v. United States, 168 A.3d 703, 722-723 (D.C.', 'Page 88', '2017).  See generally 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure:  A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 11.4, at 325-326 (5th ed. 2012) (""If the defendant does have standing with respect to the poisonous tree, that alone suffices"" to challenge admissibility of its fruits).', 'I dissent because I think that it is time that we adopt a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in circumstances, such as here, where at the time the police sought judicial permission to track the cell phone, they were properly complying with the law, namely, the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) (2006) (SCA).', '1.  Reasonable expectation of privacy in the crawl space.  I start by briefly highlighting that we have never articulated that any fruit, even those fruits in areas where the defendant does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, must be suppressed if its discovery flows from an illegal search.  The court concludes that the tracking of Cassio\'s CSLI was illegal, the defendant\'s consent to search his apartment did not remove the taint of the initial illegality, and therefore all evidence against the defendant must be suppressed.  The court determines that we need not address whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the crawl space where the cocaine was found because ""we have repeatedly held that persons subjected to an illegal seizure were entitled to suppress the fruits of that seizure even where the evidence was discovered in places where it is indisputable that the person in question did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.""  See ante at 79.  To support this proposition, the court cites three cases.  See Commonwealth v. Warren,', ', 533, 540 (2016); Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', "", 587 (2010); Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin,"", ',', 'Page 89', '998-999 (1988).  These three cases all are inapposite to the facts and circumstances of the present case and do not fully support the broad proposition that any fruit, even those fruits in areas where the defendant does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, must be suppressed if its discovery flows from an illegal search.', '', 'The court does point to Federal law, however, in support of its position.  See United States v. Olivares-Rangel, 458 F.3d 1104, 1117 (10th Cir. 2006) (""While the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applies only when the defendant has standing regarding the Fourth Amendment violation which constitutes the poisonous tree, . . . the law imposes no separate standing requirement regarding the evidence which constitutes the fruit of that poisonous tree""); United States v. Green, 275 F.3d 694, 699 (8th Cir. 2001).  Historically, we have often granted greater protections to defendants under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights than the protections provided under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See Commonwealth v. Alexis,', ', 98-99 (2018), and cases cited.  For this reason, I am inclined to think that although we have never specifically stated it, we would come to the same conclusion as the Federal courts and declare that fruits, such as the cocaine here, should be suppressed.', '2.  The exclusionary rule.  The Commonwealth obtained CSLI from Cassio\'s cell phone in 2008 pursuant to an SCA order that the Commonwealth properly sought and obtained.  Under the SCA, a court may order a telephone company to produce records, including CSLI records, ""if the governmental entity offers specific', 'Page 90', 'and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the . . . records or other information sought . . . are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.""  18 U.S.C. § 2703(d).  In 2014, six years after the Commonwealth lawfully obtained the CSLI, we held that the government must secure a warrant before accessing CSLI records.  Commonwealth v. Augustine,', ', 254-255 (2014), S.C.,', 'and', '(2015).  Four years after Augustine, the United States Supreme Court held that the government acquisition of CSLI records constitutes ""a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.""', 'Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2220 (2018).', 'In any consideration of police conduct, we must be cognizant that ""[r]easonableness [is] the \'touchstone\'"" of art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment.  Commonwealth v. Roland R.,', ', 281 (2007), quoting Commonwealth v. Gaynor,', ', 256 (2005).  The contours of reasonableness are drawn by a consideration of the nature of the intrusion into the privacy interest at play, Commonwealth v. Feyenord,', ', 86 (2005) (Greaney, J., concurring), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006), and the nature of the law enforcement interest at stake.  ""The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future police misconduct by barring, in a current prosecution, the admission of evidence that the police have obtained in violation of rights protected by the Federal and State Constitutions.""  Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 578 (2015).  ""[W]here \'the exclusionary rule does not result in appreciable deterrence, then, clearly, its use . . . is unwarranted.\'""  Commonwealth v. Wilkerson,', ', 142 (2002), quoting United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 454 (1976).  Another consideration is the protection of judicial integrity through the dissociation of the courts from unlawful conduct.  See Commonwealth v. Ford,', ', 433 (1985) (Lynch, J., dissenting).  Where those purposes are not furthered, rigid adherence to a rule of exclusion can only frustrate the public interest in the admission of evidence of', 'Page 91', 'criminal activity.  Commonwealth v. Brown,', ', 715 (2010).', 'The Supreme Court recognizes a ""good faith"" exception to the exclusionary rule where the government ""act[s] with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful"" (quotation and citation omitted).  Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 238 (2011).  We have not adopted the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, yet we have never specifically articulated why art. 14 might prohibit us from doing so.  Instead, where the good faith exception has been addressed and not reflexively dismissed, our cases have focused on whether the violations are substantial and prejudicial.  See ante at 85.  See Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 533 (2010); Commonwealth v. Rutkowski,', ', 677 (1990).  We have said that ""the mere fact that an unlawful search and seizure has occurred should not automatically result in the exclusion of any illegally seized evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Gomes,', ', 46 (1990).  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Holley,', ', 525 (2017) (warrant did not comply with particularity requirement or limit scope of search, but defendant ""suffered no prejudice""); Hernandez, supra; Commonwealth v. Beldotti,', ', 559 (1991).', 'Using the standard that has been articulated to determine whether to exclude evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search or seizure, we balance (1) the degree to which the violation undermined the principles underlying the governing rule of law, and (2) the extent to which exclusion will tend to deter such violations from being repeated in the future.  Gomes, 408 Mass. 46.  See Hernandez, 456 Mass. at 532 (exclusion is deterrent to abuse of official power based on application of State legal principles); Wilkerson, 436 Mass. at 142; Commonwealth v. Benoit,', ', 216 (1981), S.C.,', '(1983) (exceptions to strict application of exclusionary rule are justified when deterrence rationale is outweighed by competing societal interest in convicting guilty).  Where we have allowed the introduction at trial of evidence that was obtained through an illegality, it has usually turned on whether there was a technical error in procuring a warrant, not whether the police conduct was legal at the time the warrant was procured.  See Holley, 478 Mass. at 525-526; Rutkowski, 406 Mass. at 677.', 'With the touchstone of art. 14 in mind, I think that it is time we adopt the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in circumstances, such as here, where the police had an objectively', 'Page 92', 'reasonable good faith belief that their conduct was lawful at the time they applied for the SCA order.  See Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 350 (1987) (""Penalizing the officer for the [legislature\'s] error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations"" [citation omitted]).', 'Here, police fully complied with the terms of § 2703(d), which authorized the release of CSLI.  Police acted in good faith in seeking the SCA order and in relying on what they (and the judge issuing the order) reasonably understood was the existing law at the time.  In 2008, no precedent -- whether Federal or in the Commonwealth -- indicated that the use of § 2703(d) to obtain CSLI was unconstitutional.  There was nothing to suggest to the government that it reasonably could not rely on the statutory scheme set forth in § 2703(d).  Therefore, I would hold that the fact that Augustine subsequently invalidated any means of obtaining CSLI without probable cause and a warrant does not require suppression of CSLI obtained six years earlier in 2008.  See Brown, 456 Mass. at 715 (""Judicial integrity . . . is hardly threatened when evidence properly obtained under Federal law, in a federally run investigation, is admitted as evidence in State courts.  To apply the exclusionary rule in these circumstances . . . would plainly frustrate the public interest disproportionately to any incremental protection it might afford"").  See also United States v.

We recite certain facts the jury could have found, reserving other details for later discussion.  In July 2010, the fifteen year old daughter of the murder victim (victim or mother) was dating the defendant, who was nineteen.  The daughter lived in Hampden with her sister, her stepfather, and her mother.  The daughter awoke in her bedroom on July 21 to a gloved hand over her mouth.  There was a knife against her throat and a masked face staring at her.  The daughter knew from the assailant\'s voice and clothing that he was the defendant, and she later recognized him when he took off his mask.  The defendant tried to pull the daughter\'s shorts off multiple times but never entirely removed them.  He eventually put the knife down and explained to the daughter, ""I was trying to see what you would do in that situation. . . .  I was trying to show you the world wasn\'t safe.""', 'The daughter then told her mother the defendant was in her room.  They went into the room and found the defendant hiding in a closet.

She started locking the doors at night.  The victim also told her daughter that the victim would not let anything bad happen to her, and that if the defendant came back he would have to get through the victim.', ""At night on July 29, the daughter sent a text message to the defendant stating that their relationship was over.  In the morning on July 30, the family dog started barking in the victim's house.  The stepfather investigated and noticed the cellar door was open.  He closed it, and then went into the kitchen to find the victim"", 'Page 410', 'running toward him.  The victim said the defendant was in the daughter\'s room.  According to the stepfather\'s testimony, ""Before she finished saying it, [the defendant] came storming out towards us"" with a knife.  The defendant sliced the stepfather\'s throat and cut him above the eye.  The stepfather went to the door leading outside but could not open it, so he turned around and saw the defendant ""standing over"" the victim with the knife.  Although the victim was hidden behind a counter, the stepfather heard the victim making sounds similar to ""somebody getting punched.""  As the stepfather escaped outside through the door, the defendant stabbed him in the back multiple times.', ""The victim's daughter left her bedroom when she heard her stepfather's screams.  She saw the defendant stabbing her mother.  When the daughter tried to escape, the defendant dragged her into the kitchen by her hair.  The daughter saw the defendant slice her mother's throat, and then she escaped outside."", 'At trial, defense counsel admitted in the opening statement that the defendant killed the victim, and then stated that the evidence would show the defendant was guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.  After the judge declined to instruct the jury on manslaughter, defense counsel argued in closing that the defendant was not guilty of murder because he did not act with malice, but rather in response to the victim confronting him with a knife.  The defendant presented one witness:  an expert who testified about, among other things, brain development of teenagers.', 'A jury convicted the defendant of various crimes, including murder in the first degree on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty.

Constitutionality of sentence.  The defendant argues, as he did at trial, that mandatory sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional as applied to defendants who committed murder in the first degree when they were teenagers or in their early twenties.  See G. L. c. 265, § 2.  Because the defendant was nineteen years old at the time of his crimes, he contends that his sentence violates the prohibition on ""cruel and unusual punishments"" under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the prohibition on ""cruel or unusual punishments"" under art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  On this record, we decline to hold the defendant\'s sentence unconstitutional.', 'In Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 465, 470 (2012), the United States Supreme Court held that mandatory sentences of life without parole violate the Eighth Amendment when imposed on those who are under the age of eighteen when they commit homicide.  In Diatchenko v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist.,', ', 673 (2013), S.C.,', '(2015), we decided that sentences of life without parole, whether mandatory or discretionary, violate art. 26 where imposed on individuals who are under the age of eighteen when they commit murder in the first degree.  See Commonwealth v. Lugo,', ', 98-101 (2019) (describing Miller and Diatchenko).  The rulings in Miller and Diatchenko do not apply to the defendant here, who committed his crimes at the age of nineteen.', 'We recognize that ""[s]cientific and social science research on adolescent brain development . . . continues.""  Commonwealth v. Okoro,', ', 59-60 (2015).  ""For example, researchers continue to study the age range at which most individuals reach adult neurobiological maturity, with evidence that although some brain systems have fully matured in most individuals by around age fifteen, other brain functions are not likely to be fully matured until around age twenty-two.""  Id. at 60 n.14.  Indeed, the defendant\'s', 'Page 413', 'expert testified that certain parts of the brain, the frontal lobes, take over twenty years to ""finish developing.""  According to the expert, these portions of the brain regulate important functions such as ""controlling impulses, . . . inhibition of unwanted behaviors, [and] decision-making.""', 'Although this testimony and similar research may relate to the constitutionality of sentences of life without parole for individuals other than juveniles,', '""we appear to deal here with a rapidly changing field of study and knowledge.""  Id. at 60.  The minimal record on brain development in this case, consisting of one expert\'s testimony presented during trial rather than at sentencing, does not allow us to reach an informed conclusion on whether individuals in their late teens or early twenties should be given the same constitutional protections as juveniles for purposes of the Eighth Amendment and art. 26.  We decline on this record to extend beyond juveniles the decisions in Miller and Diatchenko.  Cf. Commonwealth v.

The judge conferred with the parties, and the juror then was brought before the court for a colloquy.', 'When the judge asked the juror why she would not go back into the deliberation room, she told the judge that ""a couple people [were] being argumentative,"" that another juror accused her of ""putting words in [his] mouth,"" and that ""it was just enough to upset [her].""  She acknowledged, however, that she did not feel threatened.  The judge spoke with the parties outside the juror\'s presence and indicated that, based on her responses, it appeared that the juror\'s distress stemmed from her views on the case.', '', 'When the juror returned, the judge made further inquiry.  He noted that the juror was ""emotional,"" and asked her about it.  The juror responded by listing several family members and the health issues each was experiencing, including her father who had dementia, her sister\'s husband who had Alzheimer\'s disease, her husband who had undergone hip surgery one month prior, and her daughter\'s father-in-law who was recovering from open-heart surgery.  She stated that she ""[felt] like [she] should be with family.""', 'Page 488', 'The two then had the following exchange:', 'The judge:  ""So if I could summarize, you\'ve got a lot on your plate separate and apart from your jury service; is that right?""', 'The juror:  ""Yes.""', 'The judge:  ""And the process of being put in a deliberation room and going back and forth was something that emotionally kind of tipped the balance for you?""', 'The juror:  ""Yes.""', 'The judge:  ""And all of your life experiences and the loads of life, if you will, has reached a tipping point for you.  Is that fair?""', 'The juror:  ""Yes.""', 'The judge:  ""All right.  I don\'t want to put words in your mouth.  If what I\'ve said isn\'t -- ""', 'The juror:  ""No; I just -- I didn\'t think we would be here this long.  I feel like I should be with my family; and the people in there -- it\'s just arguing, and I\'m uncomfortable.""', 'Ultimately, the judge concluded that there was ""good cause"" to discharge the juror, finding at that time that she had ""a personal issue,"" that ""the burdens in her life"" were ""significant,"" that ""her personal emotional state . . . ha[d] overwhelmed her,"" and that ""she no longer [had] an ability to participate as a juror in this case.""  The defendant requested that the judge inquire of the other jurors to ensure that they were not ""bullying"" the juror for her views.  The judge disagreed, stating that such an inquiry would impermissibly reveal the substance of the deliberations.  Over the defendant\'s objection, the judge discharged the juror and replaced her with an alternate juror.', 'The judge instructed the remaining jurors to ""begin deliberations anew"" with the alternate juror.  At some point during the renewed deliberations, the court belatedly received a note generated at 11:35 a.m. -- that is, after the jury had received their supplementary instruction that all verdicts had to be unanimous but before juror no. 44 was dismissed.  This note indicated that, despite the judge\'s supplementary instruction, the jury had remained deadlocked for the remainder of the morning.', 'Approximately ninety minutes after the alternate juror joined the jury, they returned guilty verdicts on all charges before them.', 'Page 489', 'Discussion.  1.

Tennison,"", ', 560 (2003).', 'b.  Application.  Here, the judge properly held a hearing to question the juror in the presence of both parties to find out why the juror would not continue to deliberate and to determine whether removal of the juror was warranted.  During the colloquy, the juror told the judge that she did not want to return to deliberate because members of the jury were ""being argumentative,"" that another juror accused her of ""putting words in [his] mouth,"" and that it ""upset"" her.  Although the judge initially concluded that the juror\'s problem stemmed from her ""views on the case"" rather than a ""personal problem,"" after the juror additionally expressed concern about her family members, the judge concluded that there was ""good cause"" to discharge her.', '', 'Because the juror stated during the colloquy that her distress was based not on personal issues alone, but also on events that took place in the jury room with her fellow jurors, it was error to discharge her.  See Connor, 392 Mass. at 844-845.  The Commonwealth points to Swafford,', ', and Commonwealth v. Leftwich,', '(2000), two cases in which we upheld the discharge of a deliberating juror, arguing that the circumstances here were comparable.  We disagree.', 'In Leftwich, 430 Mass. at 873-874, we concluded that the juror was discharged properly where the judge based the decision to discharge on ""the juror\'s statement that she could not continue to deliberate in a fair manner and because of the physical manifestations of stress that the judge had observed.""  The judge found that ""the juror was very emotionally distraught, was shaking \'from head to toe,\' and was clearly under extraordinary stress.""  Id. at 873.  Although the juror\'s ""extreme emotional distress"" was connected, in part, to deliberations, we concluded that ""[i]f a deliberating juror', 'Page 491', 'is determined to be experiencing severe emotional or mental distress, well beyond that level of distress that often accompanies deliberations, it is within the trial judge\'s discretion to discharge that juror after consideration of all the circumstances,"" because ""[w]e do not . . . require jurors to serve at their peril.""  Id. at 874.  In contrast, here, the judge noted that the juror was ""visibly upset"" and ""emotional,"" but there was no finding that the juror was incapacitated by ""extreme emotional distress.""  See id. at 872-874 (deliberating juror was ""having difficulty breathing,"" among other issues, due to stress of deliberations).', 'Nor are the circumstances in this case akin to those in Swafford, 441 Mass. at 337, where we held that a judge properly discharged a juror who ""physically separated herself from the jury, took leave from participation in their deliberations, and told the judge four times that she could no longer be fair and impartial.""  We concluded that although the juror\'s behavior appeared to stem from a perceived slight by another juror, ""the judge\'s finding that the juror\'s reclusive and abdicatory behavior was a problem personal to her, and not in any normal sense the product of her relationship to her fellow jurors, was not clearly erroneous.""  See id.  Here, the juror did not tell the judge that she could not be fair, nor was there any indication that the juror\'s behavior was aberrant in any way.', 'We also note that, although the issue goes to the question of prejudice, there was no concern in either Leftwich or Swafford that the discharged juror held a minority view or that the jury were at an impasse.  See Swafford, 441 Mass. at 337; Leftwich, 430 Mass. at 874.  In contrast, here, as discussed in more detail infra, there were indications that the jury were deadlocked at the time the juror refused to continue to deliberate.', 'We do understand that the judge here was in a difficult position:  he was confronted with an emotional juror who had removed herself from the jury room and said that she would not continue to deliberate.  However, the judge had options available to him rather than dismissing the juror at that point.', 'For example, a judge in this situation might express sympathy for the juror\'s personal situation, but also remind the reluctant juror of the defendant\'s right to a fair trial, and of the oath the juror took at the beginning of the trial to ""well and truly try the issue between the commonwealth and the defendant . . . according to [the] evidence.""  G. L. c. 278, § 4.  If, as in this case, it appears that emotions in the jury room are heated, a judge might', 'Page 492', ""direct the jury to take a break to allow for a cooling off period.  See Mass. R. Crim. P. 20 (e) (3),  378 Mass. 889  (1979).  Indeed, depending on the time of day, a judge might even suspend deliberations until the following business day.  In our view, a juror expressing reluctance (or an outright refusal) to continue to deliberate is an invitation to the judge to discuss the juror's concerns generally -- that is, without delving into deliberations.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. McCowen,"", "", 487-489 (2010) (member of deadlocked jury properly discharged where father of juror's child was being prosecuted by same district attorney).  It is also an opportunity for the judge to explain the importance of that juror's participation in the process to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial.  See Commonwealth v. Torres,"", ', 731-737 (2009) (due to problem juror, ""the deliberations took several sharp turns, but the judge, with a responsive and steady hand, kept the jury on course by continually focusing them on their duties to deliberate fairly"").', 'We acknowledge that, had the juror rejoined the deliberations, the end result well might have been a mistrial.  Although it is not the ideal outcome, mistrials do occur.  If, after ""due and thorough deliberation,"" the jury report to the judge twice that they are deadlocked, ""they shall not be sent out again without their own consent, unless they ask from the court some further explanation of the law.""  See G. L. c. 234A, § 68C.  Nevertheless, in these circumstances, an attempt must first be made to determine whether the juror\'s purported inability to continue deliberations is a ""demonstrable reality"" (citation omitted).  See Connor, 392 Mass. at 846-847.', 'c.  Prejudice.  Having concluded that the discharge of the juror during deliberations was error, we turn to the question whether the error was prejudicial to the defendant.  See G. L. c. 234A, § 74, which provides that any ""irregularity"" with respect to discharging or managing jurors, among other things, will not lead to reversal unless the error is preserved by objection and the ""objecting party has been specially injured or prejudiced thereby.""', '', 'We begin by noting that the error was of constitutional dimension.  Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights affords each criminal defendant the right to a fair jury trial.  That', 'Page 493', 'right has the potential to be infringed upon when a juror is discharged during deliberations.  Swafford, 441 Mass. at 336, quoting Connor, 392 Mass. at 845 n.4 (allowing ""discharge only for personal reasons ensures that such action will not \'affect the substance or the course of the deliberations\'"").  See United States v. Brown, 823 F.2d 591, 596-597 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (discharging deliberating juror for reasons related to his or her doubts about government\'s evidence is ""unacceptable under the [United States] Constitution"").  ""In order to safeguard a defendant\'s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury, the judge must carefully scrutinize the reasons offered for discharging a juror at this critical stage of trial \'to ensure that a lone dissenting juror is not permitted to evade [the] responsibilities\' of his oath or to avoid the stress associated with persistently asserting a minority position in deliberations.""  Commonwealth v. Francis,', ', 368 (2000), quoting Connor, supra at 843.', 'A constitutional error preserved by a timely objection, as this one was, is reviewed to determine whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Commonwealth v. Vinnie,', "", 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998), citing Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23 (1967).  Upon review, we conclude that, given the events that took place before and after the juror's replacement, and considering the substance of the colloquy with the juror, discharging the juror was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."", 'Prior to the colloquy with the juror, the jury sent a note to the judge asking, ""If we cannot get 12-0, must we vote \'not guilty\'?""  During the colloquy, the juror indicated that people were arguing and that it upset her.  An additional note, which was generated in the morning but did not reach the court until after the juror had been dismissed and replaced, indicated that the jury were deadlocked on two counts.  Finally, approximately ninety minutes after the juror was replaced and the jury were instructed to begin their deliberations anew, the defendant was convicted on all counts.  Together, these facts allow for the inference that the removal of the juror had an impact on the outcome of the case.  In the circumstances, the Commonwealth cannot meet its burden to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24 (burden is on ""beneficiary of a constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained"").  See also Commonwealth v. Marini,', ', 520 (1978) (same).', 'Page 494', 'Jury trials often, if not always, require the balancing of countervailing concerns.  It appears that in this case jury deliberations became contentious, and when combined with the juror\'s personal circumstances, this contentiousness resulted in the juror\'s reluctance to continue her involvement.  However, ensuring a fair trial in which the outcome is a unanimous verdict or, if need be, a mistrial is the reason for the rule articulated in Connor, 392 Mass. at 844, which allows a deliberating juror to be discharged ""', '[for] reasons personal to [the] juror"" (emphasis added).  Thus, as ""uncomfortable"" as the juror may have felt in the jury room, our law does not allow for the removal of a dissenting juror to resolve an impasse in deliberations.

We disagree.', 'In reviewing evidence presented at trial for sufficiency, we view it in the light most favorable to the prosecution.  Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 677 (1979), quoting Jackson v.

The other car then drove up to the passenger\'s side of the Altima, and someone fired seven or eight gunshots at them.', 'Page 696', 'Lima attempted to shield himself from the shots but could not do so because he was driving.  He then turned into a nearby parking lot, where the Altima slowed down and rolled into an apartment building.  At that point, Archer noticed that Lima had been shot.

The other car quickly sped away before Archer could determine the type of car or the number of people inside it.', ""Police found the Altima crashed into the building with all four of its windows shattered.  Archer was standing in front of the open driver's side door, while Lima was lying unresponsive in the driver's seat.  Lima was immediately transported to the hospital, where he died shortly thereafter.  An autopsy later revealed that he had been shot three times.  The medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was due to gunshot wounds."", 'At the scene, the police interviewed an eyewitness, Nicholas Melo, who had been sitting on his porch when he heard eight or nine loud bangs.  Melo then witnessed a car round the corner near his house, hit the curb, and speed down the street.  Melo initially told the police that he saw a Chevy Malibu Max, but later described it as a regular Chevy Malibu.', 'The day after the shooting, a police officer, accompanied by a State police trooper, was driving in an unmarked police cruiser in Brockton when he passed a Chevy Malibu.  The officer began searching for the Malibu, believing that he recognized an individual with an active arrest warrant in the back seat.  A few minutes later, he identified the Malibu and stopped it.', 'As he approached the vehicle, the officer quickly realized that the individual he was looking for was not in the back seat.  Instead, he found Christopher Hanson in the driver\'s seat, the defendant in the front passenger\'s seat, and Eddie Ortega in the back seat.  The officer made brief conversation with the three occupants before learning that Hanson was not on the rental agreement for the vehicle.  The officer then advised Hanson that because he was not listed on the rental agreement, the vehicle would have to be towed.  All three occupants left on foot.  The officers did not search the Malibu before towing it to the police station.  The officers then brought Melo to the police station, where he told the officers that he was ""sure"" that the Malibu was the same car he had seen the night before and stated that it should have scrape marks underneath the front driver\'s side quarter and the rear passenger\'s side quarter -- where the car had gone over the curb.', 'Page 697', 'He and a detective both looked under the Malibu, and the detective observed what appeared to be fresh scrape marks in the area where Melo said they would be.', 'At trial, Ortega testified about the moments immediately preceding the motor vehicle stop.  While riding in the back seat of the Malibu, Ortega heard the defendant and Hanson discuss the shooting that had occurred the previous night.  During this conversation, the defendant stated that he had shot the wrong person, and that the shooting was not supposed to ""go down"" like it had.  Ortega also heard the defendant admit to using a .22 caliber handgun in the shooting.  Additionally, Ortega testified that just before the vehicle was stopped, Hanson quickly turned onto a side street.  At that moment, the defendant took a .22 caliber handgun out of the glove compartment and threw it onto a nearby residential lawn.

The defendant also stated that he was not worried about his earlier encounter with the police because ""he ha[d] shooting cases in the past,"" and because he knew ""how to get out of the car and to shoot.""

A few days later, Grinion met the defendant at an apartment in Fall River, where he saw the defendant with the .22 caliber handgun.', 'On May 28, 2007, Grinion conducted a controlled purchase of the .22 caliber gun from the defendant.', 'When he gave Grinion the gun, the defendant instructed him not to ""drop any of the shells"" if Grinion used the gun because it was connected to a murder and another shooting.

He also indicated that he did not want Santos to know that he had lied about his involvement in the murder.', 'On June 1, 2007, the police executed an arrest warrant for the defendant.  The police then searched the Fall River apartment and recovered thirteen .22 caliber live rounds.  At trial, the Commonwealth introduced ballistics evidence collected from the scene of the shooting, which occurred on Main Street (Main Street shooting), including several .22 caliber shell casings.  A ballistics expert compared these shell casings to the .22 caliber gun recovered from the controlled purchase, and concluded that at least some of the casings were fired from that gun.', ""Over the defendant's objection, the Commonwealth also introduced evidence relating to the defendant's involvement in an"", 'Page 699', ""earlier shooting that occurred about one month prior to Lima's killing on Exchange Street in Brockton (Exchange Street shooting).

The two were assigned to warrant apprehension duty.  Earlier that day, Detective McDermott briefed Schaaf about the prior night\'s shooting and summarized Melo\'s description of the suspect vehicle.  Specifically, McDermott described the suspect vehicle as a Chevy Malibu Max that was ""tannish or goldish in color"" and had a ""sloped back.""  He also stated that Melo believed the vehicle would have scrape marks on the bumper.  McDermott distributed copies of a printed photograph, provided by Melo, depicting what Melo believed the vehicle looked like.', 'Later that afternoon, while traveling on a street in Brockton, Schaaf observed a ""grayish-green"" Chevy Malibu headed in the opposite direction.  From the police cruiser, Schaaf observed three occupants in the vehicle.  Based on a three-second view of the vehicle, Schaaf believed that the rear passenger was Jose Correia, an individual who had an outstanding arrest warrant.', 'Schaaf and Fries reversed their direction, losing sight of the vehicle for about a minute before eventually finding it again.', 'Page 700', ""From this position, Schaaf was only able to view the back of the rear passenger's head.  Schaaf thereafter effected a stop by activating the cruiser's lights."", ""Schaaf approached the vehicle on the driver's side, while Fries approached from the passenger side.  As he approached, Schaaf realized that the rear passenger was not Correia.  He apologized to the three occupants and informed them that he had mistakenly thought the rear passenger saw someone else.  Schaaf had some familiarity with the passengers, and they recognized him."", 'The occupants and Schaaf then engaged in some small talk.', ""While talking with the occupants, Schaaf asked Hanson for his driver's license.  Hanson provided a valid driver's license and told Schaaf that the defendant had rented the vehicle.  Schaaf was then informed that the defendant's girlfriend had in fact rented the vehicle.  Based on this verbal exchange, Schaaf asked to see the rental agreement.  He reviewed the agreement and observed that none of the vehicle's occupants was listed as authorized operators."", 'Schaaf then informed all three occupants that they were not allowed to drive the vehicle, and that he intended to secure the vehicle for the renter to retrieve it.  The three occupants left on foot.  Schaaf did not conduct a search of the vehicle or the occupants at that time.', 'After the occupants had left the scene, Schaaf realized that the vehicle might be the same vehicle suspected of being involved in the prior night\'s shooting.  He noted that although the vehicle was a regular Chevy Malibu, not a Malibu Max as Melo had initially described, and was ""grayish-green"" rather than gold or tan in color, he believed it had a ""sloped back"" similar to Melo\'s description.  Schaaf then contacted Detective McDermott and described the vehicle to him.  Based on Schaaf\'s description, McDermott ordered the car towed to the police station, where it was parked in the station\'s garage and cordoned off with yellow police tape.', 'At the police station, McDermott and another detective spoke to the renter of the vehicle, Deolinda Andrade.  During the conversation, Andrade stated that she had given someone else permission to drive the rental car.  McDermott informed Andrade that', 'Page 701', ""she may have violated her rental agreement by allowing an unlisted individual to drive the vehicle.  He then called the rental company and was informed that Andrade's rental agreement would be terminated due to the violation.  Based on this information, McDermott decided not to release the vehicle to Andrade."", 'Several hours later, the police brought Melo to the police station so that he could look at the exterior of the vehicle.  Melo immediately recognized the vehicle as the one he had observed the night before.', 'The following day, McDermott obtained written consent from the rental company to search the vehicle.  The vehicle was then transported to State Police headquarters, where it was searched.', '', ""The defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress, arguing that the stop, seizure, impoundment, and search of the Malibu violated his rights under Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  Specifically, the defendant sought to suppress the following evidence that resulted from the search:  (i) Melo's identification of the vehicle, (ii) the exterior damage to the vehicle, and (iii) the fingerprints obtained from the vehicle.  The motion was denied after a hearing."", 'b.  Analysis.  On appeal, the defendant reprises the arguments he made in support of his motion to suppress.  He claims that the officers should not have stopped the Malibu once they realized that they had mistakenly identified the rear passenger, or at least that the stop should have been immediately discontinued.  He also asserts that the officers had no basis to impound the vehicle or tow it to the police station, and that the subsequent search of vehicle was therefore unconstitutional.  We agree that the stop should have been discontinued once the officers determined that Correia was not in the vehicle, and that the unnecessarily prolonged stop constituted an illegal seizure.  We further conclude that, under the circumstances here, the evidence obtained from the subsequent impoundment and search of the Malibu was the direct result of the illegal seizure of the defendant, and that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proving that the evidence from the Malibu was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal seizure such that it should not be deemed a forbidden ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" under art. 14.  Accordingly, the motion', 'Page 702', ""judge erred in denying the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the Malibu."", 'i.  Initial stop of the vehicle.  Under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, an individual has the right to be free from all unreasonable searches and seizures.  Commonwealth v. Buckley,', ', 865 (2018).  A motor vehicle stop constitutes a seizure of all individuals detained in the stop.  See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809-810 (1996); Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 773 (2015).  The police may stop a motor vehicle to ""make a threshold inquiry where suspicious conduct gives the officer reason to suspect that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Watson,', ', 729 (2000), quoting Commonwealth v. Silva,', ', 405 (1974).  See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968).  In reviewing the constitutionality of a motor vehicle stop, we must determine ""first, whether the initiation of the investigation by the police was permissible in the circumstances, and second, whether the scope of the search was justified by the circumstances.""  Commonwealth v. Moses,', ', 140 (1990), citing Silva, supra at 21.', 'To effect a valid investigatory stop, the police must have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity ""based on specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer\'s experience.""  Silva, 366 Mass. at 406, citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 21.  Here, the officers had sufficiently articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that the passenger in the back seat of the vehicle had an active warrant for his arrest.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Owens,', "", 599 (1993) (motor vehicle stop warranted by reasonable belief that registered owner, who had active warrant for his arrest, was driving vehicle).  The motion judge credited Detective Schaaf's testimony that he had previous knowledge of Correia's active arrest warrant.  Schaaf also testified that he was familiar with Correia's physical appearance.  Although his view of the Malibu was both distant and brief, Schaaf's observation of the Malibu's occupants supported his reasonable, albeit mistaken, belief that Correia was the rear passenger.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Garden,"", ', 46 (2008) (motor vehicle stop warranted by mistaken belief that registered owner was driving with suspended license).  Thus, the motion judge properly concluded that the initial stop was reasonable.', 'ii. Duration of the stop.  We must next determine whether the scope of the stop was justified under the circumstances.  The', 'Page 703', 'motion judge found that although Detective Schaaf quickly realized Correia was not the rear passenger, his request for Hanson\'s driver\'s license was a ""minimal intrusion upon the operator.""  The motion judge also concluded that Schaaf acted reasonably in requesting the rental agreement, thereby continuing the stop, because he had received ""concurrent conflicting information regarding who had rented and was legitimately responsible for the Malibu.""  We disagree.', 'A valid investigatory stop ""cannot \'last longer than reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\'""  Commonwealth v. Amado,', ', 151 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Cruz,', ', 465 (2011).  See Commonwealth v. Sinforoso,', ', 323 (2001).  The scope of a stop may only extend beyond its initial purpose if the officer is confronted with facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that ""further criminal conduct is afoot"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Cordero,', ', 243 (2017).  Where an officer conducts an ""uneventful threshold inquiry giving rise to no further suspicion of criminal activity, he may not prolong the detention or expand the inquiry"" (citation omitted).  Buckley, 478 Mass. at 873.  See Commonwealth v. Gonsalves,', ', 663 (1999) (noting that individuals do not expect police officers conducting traffic stops to engage in ""stalling tactics, obfuscation, strained conversation, or unjustified exit orders, to prolong the seizure in the hope that, sooner or later, the stop might yield up some evidence of an arrestable crime"").', 'Because the initial purpose of the stop in this case was to apprehend Correia, the stop should have concluded as soon as Detective Schaaf realized he had mistakenly identified the rear passenger, and nothing else had caused concern.  At that moment, the officers had no reason to continue the stop.  Garden, 451 Mass. at 46 (purpose of stop completed when officers discovered that registered owner of vehicle, who officers knew to have suspended license, was not driving).  See Cordero, 477 Mass. at 242, quoting Rodriguez v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1609, 1614 (2015) (""Police authority to seize an individual ends \'when tasks tied to the [detention] are -- or reasonably should have been -- completed\'"").  Thus, Detective Schaaf\'s request for Hanson\'s driver\'s license, coupled with his continued questioning of the occupants, including the defendant, constituted an unlawful seizure of the Malibu and its occupants.', 'The Commonwealth argues that the officers acted reasonably in', 'Page 704', 'extending the stop to clarify ownership of and responsibility for the Malibu.  To the extent Detective Schaaf received conflicting information', ""from the occupants on this point, this exchange did not provide a sufficient basis to continue the stop for the purpose of investigating the Malibu's rental status.  Schaaf credibly testified that he had no reason to believe that the Malibu had been stolen, or that Hanson lacked authorization from the renter to drive it.  The record provides no evidence that the occupants appeared nervous or responded evasively to Schaaf's inquiries.  The mere fact that the Malibu was rented,"", 'without more, could not alone support a reasonable suspicion that the occupants were engaged in criminal conduct.  See Commonwealth v. Locke,', "", 502 (2016) (defendant's statement that another individual rented vehicle did not contribute to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity); Commonwealth v. Bartlett,"", "", 471 (1996) (officer's knowledge that vehicle was rented by another individual did not support reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in drug-related activity).  Contrast Commonwealth v. Cabrera,"", ', 346-347 (2010) (officer\'s knowledge that vehicle was rented, coupled with defendant\'s evasive explanation as to ownership of vehicle, contributed to reasonable suspicion of drug-related activity).  In addition, the verbal exchange between Schaaf and the vehicle\'s occupants occurred after the officers had already completed the purpose of the stop.  Therefore, Schaaf\'s knowledge of the vehicle\'s rental status derived solely from an ""investigatory conversation for which [he] had no lawful basis.""  Bartlett, 41 Mass. App. Ct. at 472.  The initial stop was therefore unreasonably extended and constituted an illegal seizure.  Cf. Cordero, 477 Mass. at 247 (where purpose of motor vehicle stop was effectuated, and where no reasonable suspicion of additional criminal activity, police ""did not have a legitimate basis to detain the defendant, and the defendant should have been allowed to drive', 'Page 705', 'away""); Commonwealth v. Torres,', ', 163 (1997) (continued detention of passengers after purpose of stop had been satisfied constituted illegal seizure).  See J.A. Grasso, Jr. & C.M. McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law § 4-4[b] (2017) (""investigative detention must be temporary and must last no longer than necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop"").  The motion judge therefore erred in finding that the officers validly extended the scope of the initial stop.', ""iii.  The impoundment and search of the Malibu as fruit of the poisonous tree.  Rather than letting the occupants drive away in the vehicle, as the police were required to do, the police continued their investigatory questioning and eventually forced the passengers out of the Malibu and impounded it.  Evidence resulting from a subsequent search of the vehicle included Melo's identification of the vehicle as the one he had seen on the night of the shooting, the exterior damage to the vehicle, and the latent fingerprints belonging to the defendant obtained from the interior of the vehicle.  The defendant argues that all of this evidence should have been suppressed under the exclusionary rule.  We agree."", 'As an initial matter, the Commonwealth argues that the defendant does not have standing to challenge the admission of this evidence because, as the passenger of a rental vehicle operated by someone other than the renter, the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the impounded Malibu or its exterior.  This argument, however, misses the mark.', 'Standing under the Fourth Amendment requires the defendant to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized.  Commonwealth v. Mubdi,', ', 391 (2010).  Under art. 14, by contrast, the question of standing remains separate from the question of reasonable expectation of privacy.  Commonwealth v. Williams,', ', 208 (2009) (standing and reasonable expectation of privacy are ""interrelated,"" but considered ""separately"").  Ordinarily, a defendant has standing if he or she has either ""a possessory interest in the place searched or in the property seized or if [he or] she was present when the search occurred.""', 'Id.', 'Page 706', 'There is no question that the defendant had standing to challenge the legality of the seizure of his person when police stopped the Malibu and detained its occupants for an extended period of time.  Whren, 517 U.S. at 809-810 (""Temporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a \'seizure\' of \'persons\'"" under Fourth Amendment).  He also would reasonably expect that the police would leave him and the other passengers in the vehicle alone and let them drive away if the police had no proper reason for detaining them and the vehicle.  See Gonsalves, 429 Mass. at 663 (""Citizens do not expect that police officers handling a routine traffic violation will engage,', ', in stalling tactics, obfuscation, strained conversation, or unjustified exit orders, to prolong the seizure in the hope that, sooner or later, the stop might yield up some evidence of an arrestable crime"" [emphasis added]).  Thus, at least during the unreasonably prolonged detention of the defendant and the vehicle in which he was traveling, there is no question that he had standing to challenge the seizure.  As this prolonged detention was unconstitutional, and the evidence at issue flowed therefrom, the proper focus is on fruit of the poisonous tree, not whether the defendant had standing or a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Malibu at the time of its impoundment.  See Commonwealth v. Fredericq,', ', 78-79 (2019).', '""Under what has become known as the \'fruit of the poisonous tree\' doctrine, the exclusionary rule bars the use of evidence derived from an unconstitutional search or seizure.""  Fredericq, 482 Mass. at 78.  See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963).  In determining whether the evidence is considered a fruit of the poisonous tree, we consider ""\'whether . . . the evidence . . . has been come at by exploitation of [that] illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\'""  Fredericq, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Damiano,', ', 453 (2005).', 'It matters not whether the defendant in this case had standing or a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Malibu once it was impounded by the police.  As we have recently noted, evidence may be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree ""even if it is found in a place where the defendant has no reasonable expectation', 'Page 707', 'of privacy.""  Fredericq, 482 Mass. at 78, discussing Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 486-487.  Accordingly, we have held that persons subjected to an illegal seizure are ""entitled to suppress the fruits of that seizure even where the evidence was discovered in places where it is indisputable that the person in question did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.""  Fredericq, supra at 79.', 'The Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that the evidence it has ""obtained and intends to use is sufficiently attenuated from the underlying illegality so as to be purged from its taint"" (quotation omitted).  Id. at 78, quoting Damiano, supra at 454.  We conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to meet that burden here.', 'The Commonwealth obtained the evidence identified supra as a direct result of the illegal seizure of the defendant and the car in which he was traveling.  Indeed, without the illegal seizure, the police would have had no grounds to impound the vehicle and conduct a search of it.  Rather, the defendant and the other occupants of the vehicle would have, and should have, been free to leave in the vehicle following the initial stop.  The impoundment and subsequent search occurred close in time to the illegal seizure, and there were no intervening circumstances between the illegal conduct and the later discovery of the evidence that would have been sufficient to dissipate the taint of the illegal seizure.  See Commonwealth v. Long,', ', 536 (2017) (factors bearing on attenuation include ""length of time between the [illegal act] and the discovery of the evidence [temporal attenuation]; whether any circumstances intervened between the illegal act and the discovery of the evidence [intervening circumstances]; and how integral the unlawful search was to the acquisition of the evidence [purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful conduct]"").  Although the illegal police misconduct here may not have been flagrant, this factor is not dispositive when balanced against the other two.  Cf. Fredericq, 482 Mass. at 81-85 (no attenuation where evidence was obtained in close proximity to illegality and there were no intervening circumstances, even where police misconduct was neither flagrant nor purposeful); Commonwealth v. Estabrook,', ', 864-865 (2015) (same).  Accordingly, the seizure of the evidence from the Malibu was derived as a result of the exploitation of the illegal seizure, rather than by ""means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the', 'Page 708', 'primary taint"" (citation omitted).  Damiano, 444 Mass. at 453.', 'The evidence therefore should have been suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree.  Cf. Torres, 424 Mass. at 163 (continued detention of defendant and passenger no longer necessary after defendant satisfied purpose of stop by producing license and registration; all evidence seized after that point suppressed as fruit of poisonous tree).  Its admission in evidence at trial was thus error.', '', 'Page 709', 'iv.  Harmless error.

Tyree,', ', 700 (2010), quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). Our review under this standard considers a number of factors, including:', '""[1] the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\'s case; [2] the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; [3] who introduced the issue at trial; [4] the frequency of the reference; [5] whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence; [6] the availability or effect of curative instructions; and [7] the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt.""', 'Commonwealth v. Seino,', ', 467-468 (2018), quoting Commonwealth v. Dagraca,', ', 553 (2006).  We then must decide, based ""on the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, [whether] we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury\'s verdicts.""  Tyree, 455 Mass. at 701.', ""The evidence obtained from the Malibu and introduced in evidence by the Commonwealth was particularly important in connecting the defendant to the shooting.  Through Melo's trial testimony and the distinctive scraping found underneath the car, the Commonwealth sought to prove that the impounded Malibu was the suspect vehicle involved in the shooting.  At trial, Melo"", 'Page 710', ""testified that he saw a gold or tan Chevy Malibu round the corner near his house, hit the curb on the right side of the intersection, and drive down his street at a high rate of speed.  Melo's testimony was compelling, particularly because he stated that the bottom of the right side of the Malibu would have distinctive scrape marks from when the vehicle rounded the turn, and the car proved to have such marks.  Melo also unequivocally identified the Malibu once he saw it at the station.  This identification was corroborated by police testimony demonstrating that the Malibu's exterior damage was consistent with damage to the Altima that Lima was driving at the time of the shooting."", 'Although this evidence does not conclusively connect the defendant to the crime, his presence in the Malibu the following day strongly suggested his involvement in the murder.  The Commonwealth unmistakably relied on this evidence, highlighting its significance during opening and closing arguments.  Indeed, without the evidence obtained from the Malibu, the Commonwealth\'s case falls predominantly on Grinion\'s testimony and ballistics evidence collected from the scene.  Although this untainted evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant, we cannot say that it was ""so powerful as to nullify any effect that the improperly admitted evidence might have had"" on the jury or the verdict (quotations and citations omitted).  Commonwealth v. Dame,', "", 537, cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 132 (2016).  As Grinion was an informant with a troubled history, his credibility was vulnerable.  We therefore conclude that the erroneous admission of evidence deriving from the illegal seizure of the defendant was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The defendant's convictions must therefore be vacated."", 'Because the evidence at trial was sufficient to support his convictions, however, we address other claims of error that are likely to recur upon retrial.', '', 'Page 711', ""2. Prior bad acts evidence.  The defendant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence relating to the defendant's involvement in a prior shooting.  On April 28, 2007, less than one month before the Main Street shooting on May 21, 2007, there was a shooting on Exchange Street in Brockton.  The police recovered three .22 caliber shell casings from the scene of the Exchange Street shooting.  They later found ten .22 caliber shell casings and four .40 caliber shell casings at the scene of the Main Street shooting."", ""At trial, the jury heard testimony about the defendant's involvement in the prior Exchange Street shooting.  Grinion testified that the defendant told him that he had used a .22 caliber handgun -- the same handgun Grinion recovered from a controlled purchase on May 28, 2007 -- in a shooting on Exchange Street the previous month.  Ortega also testified that the defendant admitted to his involvement in a prior shooting on Exchange Street.  Both witnesses testified that they had seen the defendant in possession of the .22 caliber handgun on more than one occasion prior to May 21, 2007."", 'A ballistics expert examined the three .22 caliber casings from the Exchange Street shooting and the ten .22 caliber casings from the Main Street shooting.  He also test-fired the .22 caliber handgun that Grinion retrieved from the defendant.  At trial, the expert testified that eight out of the ten casings from Main Street and all three of the casings from Exchange Street were fired from that same .22 caliber handgun.', 'This evidence was the subject of a motion in limine at trial.  After hearing from both parties, the trial judge allowed the admission of this evidence, concluding that it was relevant to identify the defendant as the person who shot Lima, and to show that he had the means to commit the crime.  In his postconviction motion for a new trial, the defendant argued that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion.', 'Page 712', 'As the defendant objected to the admission of this evidence at trial, we review for prejudicial error.  See Commonwealth v. Imbert,', ', 586 (2018).  We must first determine whether the judge committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion.  Commonwealth v. Camacho,', ', 591 (2015).  A judge\'s discretionary decision constitutes an abuse of discretion where the judge makes a ""clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision . . . such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives"" (quotation and citation omitted).  L.L. v. Commonwealth,', ', 185 n.27 (2014).  If we find such an error, we then ask whether it was prejudicial.  Commonwealth v.

Helfant,', ', 228 n.13 (1986) (""There is no bright-line test for determining temporal remoteness of evidence of prior misconduct"").  Additionally, this evidence corroborated Grinion\'s testimony that the defendant had been involved in the Exchange Street shooting.  Thus, the trial judge properly concluded that evidence of the defendant\'s involvement in the prior Exchange Street shooting was relevant to establish his identity as the shooter in this case.', 'Furthermore, evidence that the defendant possessed the .22 caliber handgun, and used it in the prior shooting, was also relevant to show that he had the means to commit the crime.

The jury were not permitted to hear evidence that the defendant shot, or intended to shoot, anyone in the Exchange Street shooting.', ""In addition, the judge instructed the Commonwealth to use leading questions so as to limit the testimony presented.

Prior to trial, defense counsel was provided copies of the wiretap recordings obtained by Grinion through his work as a confidential informant.

Tavares,', "", 290 (2011).  The suppressed recordings were not admitted at trial, nor was there any mention that the defendant's conversations were recorded."", 'Following his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to seek the suppression of evidence derived from the wiretap recordings pursuant to G.

During the pretrial proceedings, trial counsel reminded the court that the wiretap recordings had been suppressed, and reiterated his concern that one of the witnesses would inadvertently discuss the recordings.  In his affidavit, trial counsel also stated that he did not file a motion to suppress because he ""did not think that any evidence had been derived from the wiretap recordings involved in this case.""', 'The defendant has thus failed to demonstrate with any specificity how the unlawful recordings may have affected the admissibility of Grinion\'s trial testimony.

The defendant asserts that, without access to the recordings on appeal, he could not effectively argue in support of his motion for a new trial.  An examination of the recordings, he contends, is necessary to identify the specific evidence introduced at trial which derived from the recordings.  He further asserts that the Commonwealth\'s ""refusal to produce the tape or transcript of the illegal wiretap"" violated his constitutional right to due process of law under both the Federal and State Constitutions.

We therefore affirm the defendant's convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial."", ""Background.  We summarize the facts that the jury could have found, reserving other facts for our discussion of specific issues.  At approximately 4 p.m. on December 16, 2010, a sole gunman shot the victim in the arm, chest, and head while he sat in a parked car outside a housing complex in the Roxbury section of Boston.  The shooter fled the scene on foot.  Police and emergency medical personnel soon arrived and attempted to save the victim's life.  These efforts proved unsuccessful, and the victim was pronounced dead shortly thereafter."", 'Police immediately began to canvas the crime scene.  In the course of their investigation, police interviewed several witnesses at the scene who provided detailed descriptions of the suspected shooter.  While their descriptions varied slightly, these witnesses consistently described the suspected shooter as a black- or brown-skinned male wearing a large black coat with a fur collar, dark jeans, and dark shoes.  Several witnesses also stated that the man had a distinctive gait, describing his walk as something akin to a limp.', 'Police also learned that the suspect had been seen throwing an object into a nearby Dumpster as he left the scene following the shooting.', 'As police continued to search the crime scene, they discovered four spent shell casings near where the victim was shot and a .45 caliber handgun in the Dumpster identified by witnesses.  Subsequent ballistics testing revealed this firearm to be the murder weapon.  However, police were unable to recover any fingerprints from either the firearm or the shell casings.', 'Page 541', 'Acting on information from witnesses who described the route the suspect took to flee the scene, police reviewed video footage from surveillance cameras that were located throughout the surrounding neighborhood.  Surveillance video recordings from the time frame immediately following the shooting captured footage of a man in a puffy black jacket with a fur collar, dark jeans, and dark sneakers who appeared to have a limp walking away from the crime scene.', 'Even with this information in hand, police were unable to immediately locate the suspect.  In an attempt to identify him, the police released one of the surveillance video recordings of the suspect to the public in February 2011.  To that end, the recording was posted online and broadcast by television news stations.  Several days after the video recording was released to the public, a man who identified himself as Michael Hobbs', 'telephoned Boston police and expressed his belief that the suspect in the recording was his brother, the defendant.  Michael reiterated this identification in a follow-up interview with police, and again during subsequent testimony before a grand jury.  Before the grand jury, he testified that he was able to identify the suspect as his brother due to the clothing the suspect was wearing and the distinctive way that the suspect walked.', 'In addition to identifying the defendant as the suspect in his initial call to police, Michael provided police with a telephone number for a cell phone that he understood to belong to the defendant.', ""Police then requested a court order requiring the defendant's cellular service provider to produce, among other information, the historical CSLI from the defendant's cell phone spanning several months surrounding the day of the killing.

She also testified that, based at least in part on her familiarity with the defendant\'s gait, she recognized the defendant as the suspect in the surveillance video recording that the police had released to the public.  After watching the video recording, she remarked to her cousin that she thought the suspect in the recording looked like the defendant, and later told the defendant directly that she had ""seen him on the news.""  In addition to her testimony regarding his gait, Robinson testified that she believed the suspect in the recording to be the defendant due to the clothing that the suspect was wearing.  She explained that the defendant often wore dark shoes and dark jeans, and that her husband had given the defendant a large black jacket with a fur collar at some point before the date of the killing.  Evidence also revealed that Swain-Price had possessed a .45 caliber handgun that matched the general description of the murder weapon, and that Swain-Price possessed this weapon while the defendant lived with Swain-Price and his family.', 'Finally, the lead detective in the case testified that he had recently reviewed a video recording of the defendant walking and had observed that the defendant had ""a distinctive walk,"" which appeared to him to be a limp.', '', 'After the case was submitted, the jury returned guilty verdicts on both charges and the defendant was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Police thereafter recovered from the Dumpster a .45 caliber firearm that was still warm, indicating to police that it had recently been fired.

The defendant first argues that the affidavit categorically failed to establish the requisite nexus ""between the crime[s] alleged and the article to be search or seized"" (quotation and citation omitted), White, 475 Mass. at 588, because there was no assertion in the affidavit that the defendant actually used or possessed his cell phone during the commission of the crimes.  We disagree, as neither this court nor the United States Supreme Court has required such a showing to satisfy the nexus requirement where the sought-after evidence is CSLI.

Alexis, supra.  See Holley, supra; Augustine II, 472 Mass. at 455.', 'In the context of historical CSLI, the sought-after evidence is the location of the cell phone itself, not what information may be found in the cell phone\'s contents.

As we have noted, however, the Commonwealth sought CSLI for a far greater period of time than the day of the killing; they sought and received three and one-half months of CSLI.  This extended request was in part the result of the failure to identify the defendant as a suspect for nearly two and one-half months, and the absence of any evidence of his current location once he was identified as a suspect.  Although the delay in identifying the defendant as a suspect and the difficulty in apprehending him made it difficult to define the permissible scope of the CSLI request, we assume, without deciding, that at least some of this three and one-half month period of time was unnecessary to either the investigation or apprehension of the defendant.', ""The question then presented is what a court should suppress when the requisite nexus exists for historical CSLI spanning a shorter period of time than that authorized by the search warrant -- or in this case, the § 2703 order.  More specifically, does either the Fourth Amendment or art. 14 require total suppression of the entire amount of CSLI collected, or is the proper remedy to suppress only the CSLI for which there is not the requisite nexus to the crime?  Given the uncertainty in the case law regarding overbroad requests for CSLI, and the limited briefing before the court on the issue presented, we proceed cautiously on this issue.  We conclude that, in these circumstances, where the requisite nexus for probable cause clearly exists for a reasonable period of time encompassing the commission of and flight from the crime, as well as the defendant's immediate apprehension,"", 'the CSLI for this period of time need not be suppressed so long as the CSLI for which there is not the requisite nexus to the crime is not relied on or otherwise exploited by the Commonwealth at trial.', ""Our decision in Holley is instructive in this regard.

Additionally, references to CSLI during the Commonwealth's opening statement and closing argument were limited to CSLI from the date of the killing.  As in Holley, 478 Mass. at 525, on this record, the CSLI relied on at trial was limited in content and scope such that the Commonwealth did not capitalize on the overbreadth of the § 2703 order.

Admission of detective's testimony.  Shortly before trial, the Commonwealth disclosed its intention to admit prison surveillance video footage (prison video) that had recently been captured and that purported to show that the defendant had a distinctive gait while he was incarcerated.  The Commonwealth offered that this evidence would allow the jurors to compare the defendant's gait with the gait of the suspect in the surveillance video footage from the day of the shooting that would be admitted in evidence.  The defense objected, arguing that the new evidence was not timely disclosed to the defense and that the prejudicial effect of admitting video footage of the defendant in a prison setting years after the shooting in this case substantially outweighed its probative value.  The trial judge agreed with the defense as to the latter argument, and precluded the Commonwealth from admitting the prison video.  The trial judge did, however, permit the lead detective in the case to testify about his observations of the defendant's gait in the prison video without making reference to the fact that the video footage he reviewed was of the defendant in prison.  Further, the trial judge did not allow the detective to opine as to whether he believed the defendant was the same man as the suspect in the surveillance footage."", ""At trial, the detective provided the following description of the defendant's gait as seen in the prison video:"", '""[The defendant] had a distinctive walk.

I believe I observed that [the suspect] appears to be pigeon-toed with his left foot pointing inwards, and I also observed what I believe to be, it appears as [if] he\'s walking on the inside of his foot pointing his right foot outwards.""', 'Page 554', 'The detective went on to comment on the appearance of the suspect in the video recording, describing that he observed that the suspect was wearing ""dark-colored jeans, a black coat with a fur collar,"" along with ""black sneakers, which appeared to have some red on them, and he appeared to be wearing a hooded sweatshirt with perhaps white stripes or white designs on the hood of the sweatshirt.""  This testimony concluded without the detective ever offering an opinion as to whether he thought the defendant was the suspect in the surveillance video footage.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial judge abused her discretion in admitting this testimony and that this error warrants a reversal of his convictions.  We disagree.', 'First, the defendant argues that the detective\'s testimony describing his observations about the defendant\'s gait as seen in the prison video was error because the Commonwealth did not timely disclose its intention to admit this evidence at trial.  We discern no error.  A trial judge ""possesse[s] considerable discretion in dealing with the problem created by the prosecution\'s late disclosure"" of evidence.  Commonwealth v. Hamilton,', ', 70 (1997).  When the ground for the exclusion of evidence involves late disclosure by the prosecution, ""without any showing of bad faith on [the prosecution\'s] part . . . a defendant is required to show material prejudice from the disclosure before a new trial can be considered.""  Id.  See Commonwealth v. Bresilla,', "", 432 (2015).  The defendant has demonstrated neither that the Commonwealth acted in bad faith nor that he was materially prejudiced by the late disclosure of this evidence.  The prison video was turned over to the defense on May 23, 2015, but the detective did not testify until more than two weeks later on June 10, 2015.  As the trial judge noted, defense counsel had a full and fair opportunity to consult with his expert and to prepare to cross-examine the Commonwealth's witness on this issue.  The trial judge therefore did not abuse her discretion in allowing the detective to testify on this basis."", ""Next, the defendant argues that even if this evidence was timely, the detective's testimony was improper because he effectively identified the defendant as the suspect in the surveillance footage.  Because the defendant did not object to the testimony on these grounds at trial, we review any error for substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  Commonwealth v. Almeida,"", ', 568 (2018) (where ""grounds for objection"" made at', 'Page 555', 'trial differ from those raised on appeal, ""the standard of review that applies to [the] claim is whether there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice"").  Where the jury are capable of ""viewing [a] videotape and drawing their own conclusions regarding whether the [individual] in the videotape was the defendant,"" opinion testimony from a police officer as to the identity of the individual in the recording is ordinarily not admissible.  Commonwealth v. Austin,', ', 366 (1995).  See Commonwealth v. Pina,', ', 429-430 (2019) (noting that ""testimony of a police officer, with its possibly greater imprint of authority as to identification of a defendant . . . is not permissible absent some compelling reason that the police officer is in a better position than the jury to identify the defendant"").  See also Commonwealth v. Wardsworth,', "", 476 (2019).  Here, however, although the detective described the defendant's gait and the gait of the suspect in the surveillance video recording in nearly identical terms, he did not directly offer his opinion as to whether he believed that the two gaits were similar or that he believed the defendant was the suspect in the surveillance video footage.  Rather, the officer merely described his observations of the defendant's gait in both of the video recordings he observed.  The jury were free to determine whether they believed the detective's description of the defendant's gait was similar to the gait of the suspect in the surveillance video footage -- a video recording that they had the repeated opportunity to see.  There was no identification made by the detective, and there was therefore no error."", '', ""Finally, the defendant argues that notwithstanding the detective's description of the defendant's gait in the prison video, his description of the gait and the appearance of the suspect in the surveillance video footage from the day of the shooting improperly invaded the province of the jury to draw their own conclusions as to the suspect's appearance and gait.  This is a closer question, as the officer could have been limited to describing the defendant's gait in the prison video and the jury left to make its own comparison.  Because the defendant did not object to this"", 'Page 556', 'specific testimony, we review any error to determine whether it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  Commonwealth v. Barry,', ', 407 (2019).', ""Even if it was error to admit this testimony, it is clear that it did not likely influence the jury's conclusion.  See Commonwealth v. Brown,"", "", 586 (2016) (no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice where erroneously admitted evidence did not likely influence jury's conclusion).  The amount of evidence regarding the appearance of the suspect in the surveillance video footage was substantial.  In addition to the fact that the jury were able to view the footage themselves, several witnesses from the scene of the shooting testified that the suspect was wearing a large black coat with a fur collar, dark jeans, and dark shoes.  Several others also testified that the suspect walked with what appeared to be a limp.  Additionally, each of the witnesses who was shown the surveillance video recording of the suspect identified the suspect in the recording as the man they had seen at the crime scene.  The detective's testimony describing the gait and appearance of the suspect in the surveillance video footage was therefore cumulative of other evidence at trial.  We are satisfied that his testimony did not likely influence the jury, and therefore did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice."", '', ""3.  Right to confront witnesses.  During the detective's testimony, the Commonwealth introduced call logs listing telephone numbers with which the defendant's cell phone had connected with at various times.  The Commonwealth questioned the detective about a particular telephone number with which the defendant's cell phone had connected several times on the date of the killing.  In the course of the questioning, the detective testified that this telephone number belonged to Swain-Price.  Earlier trial testimony showed that Swain-Price and the defendant were friends, and that the defendant had been living with Swain-Price at or around the time of the shooting.  Although the detective testified that the number belonged to Swain-Price, no evidence"", 'Page 557', 'was offered demonstrating how he had learned this information.  At sidebar, the Commonwealth disclosed that Swain-Price himself had told the detective that it was his telephone number during a police interview.  Swain-Price did not testify at trial.', ""On appeal, the defendant argues that because the detective's knowledge of Swain-Price's connection to the telephone number was based on testimonial hearsay and because Swain-Price did not testify, the admission of this testimony violated the defendant's confrontational rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  The Commonwealth concedes that the admission of this testimony was error, and we agree.  Defense counsel objected to this testimony, although not on the constitutional grounds argued before us on appeal.  We therefore review to determine whether its admission constituted prejudicial error.  See Commonwealth v. Imbert,"", ', 579 (2018); Commonwealth v. Grady,', ', 720 (2016).', 'Although the admission of this testimony was error, we conclude that it was not prejudicial, because there is no doubt that it ""did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Cruz,', ', 591 (2005).  Indeed, the defendant has not identified, and we cannot find, how the introduction of this testimony prejudiced him in any way.  The defendant asserts that this evidence provided a critical link between the defendant and the murder weapon because there was testimony that Swain-Price owned a .45 caliber handgun that looked similar to the murder weapon.  We are not persuaded that a call log purporting to show that the defendant called Swain-Price on the date of the killing linked the defendant to the murder weapon.  At most, the call log established that the defendant knew Swain-Price.  This fact, however, had already been established by other evidence at trial, including the fact that the defendant lived with Swain-Price for a period of time.  We are therefore confident that that evidence had no influence on the jury.  Cruz, supra.', '4.  Hearsay testimony of defendant\'s sister.  One of the Commonwealth\'s witnesses, Robinson, testified to a conversation between the defendant and Swain-Price that she overheard on the day the police released surveillance footage of the shooting suspect to the public.  Specifically, Robinson testified that she heard the defendant tell her husband that the defendant\'s sister, Nicole, had called him earlier that day and told him that she had ""seen him on [television].""  Defense counsel lodged an objection', 'Page 558', ""to this testimony, arguing that it was impermissible hearsay.  In response, the trial judge prohibited the prosecutor from inquiring further on Nicole's identification of the defendant and then instructed the jury on the general definition and parameters of hearsay.  The judge did not, however, explicitly strike the testimony or give a limiting instruction."", ""On appeal, the defendant argues that Robinson's testimony amounted to reversible error due to its potential prejudice.  As defense counsel objected to this testimony, we review for prejudicial error.  See Imbert, 479 Mass. at 579."", 'The testimony at issue contained hearsay within hearsay -- or, ""totem pole"" hearsay.  The first layer of hearsay was the defendant\'s out-of-court statement to Swain-Price.  The second layer of hearsay was Nicole\'s out-of-court statement to the defendant.  Totem pole hearsay is admissible only if each of the multiple hearsay statements falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.  Commonwealth v. DePina,', ', 623 (2017).  See Mass. G. Evid. § 805 (2019) (""Hearsay within hearsay is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the rule . . ."").', ""The defendant's out-of-court statement to Swain-Price was clearly admissible as a statement of a party opponent.  See Commonwealth v. Cruzado,"", ', 278 (2018); Mass. G. Evid. § 801(d)(2)(a) (statement not hearsay where ""statement is offered against an opposing party and . . . was made by the party"").  Nicole\'s out-of-court statement to the defendant that she had seen him on television, however, was, if offered for the truth of the matter asserted, hearsay that does not fit within any recognized exception.', 'The Commonwealth argues that Nicole\'s statement and the defendant\'s response fit within the adoptive admission exception to the rule against hearsay.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 801(d)(2)(B).  We disagree.  An adoptive admission by silence can be imputed to a defendant only where it is ""apparent that the [defendant] has heard and understood the statement, that', 'Page 559', 'he [or she] had an opportunity to respond, and that the context was one in which he [or she] would have been expected to respond to an accusation.""  Commonwealth v. Olszewski,', ', 719 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994).  See Commonwealth v. Ferreira,', ', 658 (2019).  The Commonwealth argues that the exception applies here because after the defendant\'s sister told him she had seen him on television, ""he did not deny that he was involved with the murder.""  It was not ""apparent"" from the challenged testimony, however, that the defendant responded to his sister\'s statement with silence.  Indeed, there was no testimony at all about what, if any, response the defendant gave, as the trial judge ended the line of questioning as soon as Robinson testified regarding the statement.  The Commonwealth has therefore failed to show that the defendant either understood the statement or had an opportunity to respond.  Accordingly, this exchange does not fit within the adoptive admission exception to the rule against hearsay.  See Olszewski, supra.  See also DePina, 476 Mass. at 624 (""We have cautioned . . . against the use of adoptive admissions by silence . . ."").  Its admission thus constituted an error.  We conclude, however, that the error was harmless, as it did not influence the jury in any way.  Cruz, 445 Mass. at 591.', ""Although Nicole's statement that she had seen the defendant on television was admitted in error, the testimony was cumulative of other evidence at trial and was therefore harmless.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Evans,"", "", 191, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 923 and 540 U.S. 973 (2003) (no prejudice where hearsay involving prior identification evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence).  The evidence showed that both Robinson and the defendant's brother, Michael -- both of whom knew the defendant well -- also stated that they had seen him on television in the surveillance footage that was released to the public.  Although Michael recanted this identification on direct examination at trial, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that he had identified the defendant as the suspect in the surveillance video footage several times, including in a telephone call to police soon after the footage had been released, again several months later during an in-person interview with police, and again under oath before a grand jury.  Moreover, the trial judge terminated the Commonwealth's line of questioning on Nicole's purported identification immediately after it was referenced, and the Commonwealth refrained from mentioning it at any other point during the"", 'Page 560', 'trial.  We therefore find ""with fair assurance"" that the jury in this case were ""not substantially swayed by the error"" (citation omitted).  Cruz, 445 Mass. at 591.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Spray,', ', 471 (2014); Evans, supra.', '5.  Prosecutorial misconduct.  Near the end of trial, the defense discussed with its expert witness a photograph of the defendant that was taken during his booking.  While cross-examining the expert, the prosecutor characterized the photograph as a ""booking photo.""  The defendant did not object to this statement at trial, but the trial judge nevertheless immediately instructed the prosecutor to avoid characterizing the photograph as a ""booking photo"" in the future.  The defendant argues that this characterization amounted to prosecutorial misconduct and therefore constituted an error.  Because the defense did not object to this statement when it was made, we review any error to determine if it gave rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  DePina, 476 Mass. at 624-625.', 'The defendant does not argue that this alleged error, standing alone, warrants reversal.  He only argues that it should be considered in his final argument that reversal is required due to cumulative error.  Even assuming, without deciding, that the prosecutor\'s characterization of the photograph constituted error, such an error certainly did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in this case.  The photograph was labeled ""booking photo"" by the defense expert and was seen by the jury.  Although the parties agreed to redact the reference to ""booking"" from the photograph before the case was submitted to the jury, the jury were well aware that the photograph purportedly had been taken at the defendant\'s booking.  The prosecutor\'s characterization of the photograph therefore likely did not influence the jury\'s conclusion.', '6.  Cumulative error and G. L. c. 278, § 33E.  Finally, the defendant argues that even if no one specific error argued supra requires that he be granted a new trial, the combined effect of the mistakes was so prejudicial as to create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.  We disagree.  The cumulative error was no more prejudicial than the individual errors, which, as explained supra, had minimal, if any, impact on the verdicts in this case.  See Commonwealth v. Fuller,', ', 410-414 (1995).', 'Additionally, after a thorough review of the record, we find no reason to exercise our authority under G.

On November 22, 2009, at approximately 1 A.M., the victim was shot and killed in a parking lot across the street from a nightclub in Lynn.  Surveillance footage taken from establishments located near the crime scene showed the shooting from a distance; the footage, however, was grainy and of poor quality.', ""The Commonwealth's case at trial centered on the testimony of the victim's cousin, Sheffery Johnson, who described the events that night."", 'Johnson testified that, on the evening of the shooting, she picked up Brandon Payne in her truck and they drove to a parking lot located across the street from the nightclub.', 'As they', 'Page 840', 'sat talking, Johnson saw the victim leaving the nightclub with his girlfriend.  They were with or near a ""dark skinned"" man wearing a gray sweat suit, who Johnson identified at trial as the defendant.', '', 'The victim and his girlfriend walked over to Johnson\'s truck, where several others had congregated after leaving the nightclub.  As there had been tension between Payne and the victim following an altercation several months earlier, the two began arguing, and eventually ended up outside, at the back of the vehicle.  Johnson watched them through the rear view mirror, and then got out to join them.  Shortly thereafter, she noticed someone ""pass [her]"" and join the group; she was not focused on who it was.', 'During the argument, the victim suggested that he and Payne go around the corner and fight.  After Johnson announced that there would be no fighting, she grabbed Payne and swung him around to get back into the vehicle.  As soon as her back was turned, Johnson testified that she heard a ""pop"" from the direction in which the victim had been standing.  When she turned around to face the victim, she saw the defendant standing over him, tucking a gun into his pants, and then running toward Tremont Street, with a group of about ten others.', 'At that point, Johnson was screaming at Payne because his friend had just shot her cousin.', ""Although no other witnesses who had been present that night were called to testify at trial, Johnson's testimony was corroborated, in part, by statements the defendant later made to Joseph Burns.  Burns and the defendant knew each other because the defendant typically bought guns from Burns, in exchange for drugs."", 'When the defendant and Burns met up after the shooting, Burns inquired about that night.  The defendant said that he and the victim ""had words after the club,"" and that the defendant subsequently ""shot him in the face.""  Burns also provided details', 'Page 841', 'about the shooting that were not public knowledge at the time.', ""The Commonwealth presented testimony from the defendant's roommate, Thomas Arrington, who had seen the defendant with guns in the apartment on several occasions.

The judge also had supporting affidavits from two new witnesses, Robert Brown and Bernard Edwards."", 'At the evidentiary hearing, the judge heard testimony from Bizzell, Brown, Edwards, and the defendant\'s trial counsel.  The judge credited trial counsel but made detailed factual findings regarding his reasons for strongly discrediting the testimony from Bizzell, Brown, and Edwards; central among them was a clear motive to assist the defendant by implicating a now-deceased individual.

Sullivan, supra at 350-351, quoting Grace, supra.', 'The motion judge here assumed, and the Commonwealth agrees, that the evidence at issue constitutes newly discovered material.', 'The Commonwealth also does not dispute that the evidence is admissible.', ""The defendant's main challenge on appeal, then, is to the judge's conclusions regarding the effect of the"", 'Page 845', 'new evidence and whether it casts doubt on the justice of the conviction.  We begin by setting forth the contents of the new evidence considered by the motion judge.', 'At the hearing, the judge heard testimony from Bizzell, a fellow member of the gang to which the defendant and Payne belonged.', 'In contrast to Bizzell\'s 2012 statement to the FBI, in which he reported that the ""rumor on the street"" was that Payne shot the victim, Bizzell suggested at the evidentiary hearing that he had specifically spoken with Payne about the shooting on two occasions.  Bizzell characterized those discussions as Payne just taking ""credit for [the shooting]"" among fellow gang members, and saying that the killing was ""work he put in.""  Bizzell also reported that, when he and others in the gang spoke to Payne about the shooting, they had been ""clowning,"" or teasing him, and were giving him ""grief"" for having had the defendant ""do the work for him.""  It was in response to their taunting that Payne claimed responsibility for shooting the victim.  Bizzell relayed also that the defendant had confessed that he shot the victim, notwithstanding Payne\'s attempts to convince their fellow gang members otherwise.', 'Brown, a family friend of Payne, also testified at the hearing; he stated that, after the defendant had been convicted, Brown agreed to drive Payne to pick up money to send to someone.  While the two were driving, Payne told Brown that he had ""caught a body,""', 'and that someone else ""went down for it.""  Brown testified that he later came to understand that Payne was referring to the defendant, and that they were picking up money to send to the defendant.  Brown came to this realization when he met the defendant in prison, at which time he and the defendant became aware of their mutual connection in Payne.', '', 'The judge also heard testimony from Edwards, a fellow member of the gang, who relayed that he had had three conversations', 'Page 846', 'with Payne concerning the shooting.  Edwards reported that, in the first conversation, he asked Payne about the events at the nightclub, and Payne responded that he ""had to get [him] up out of here.""  Edwards remembered Payne saying in the second conversation that ""he felt bad"" that ""his boy was doing time . . . for him.""  Edwards could not recall any specific statements that Payne had made in the third conversation, but Edwards could tell by Payne\'s body language that he felt badly about the situation and that he was ""f\'d up about it.""', ""In a detailed memorandum of decision, the judge deemed the testimony submitted by these witnesses to be contradictory, insincere, and not credible, ultimately concluding that the evidence did not carry support for the defendant's position that Payne had shot the victim."", 'Specifically, the judge did not credit Bizzell\'s testimony, due, in part, to his poor demeanor, inability to remember details, apparent insincerity, and contradictory testimony on numerous occasions.  Nor did the judge credit the testimony presented by Brown, in part, because of his admission that he was there to ""help"" the defendant.  The judge similarly did not give credence to the story presented by Edwards, in part because Edwards admitted that he would lie for a fellow gang member, ""depend[ing] on the person.""  Noting that Payne had died in 2012 and, accordingly, could be blamed for any incident without fear of reprisal, the judge concluded that these individuals had a motive to assist the defendant -- as a friend, acquaintance, or fellow gang member -- with their statements.  As the new evidence was not deemed sufficiently material or credible, the judge concluded that it did not cast real doubt on the justice of the defendant\'s conviction.

The Commonwealth's case at trial included a confession made by the defendant, to Burns, that he had shot the victim in the head following an altercation outside a nightclub.  The victim's cousin, who was with Payne when they heard the gunshot go off, also testified that she observed the defendant tucking a gun into his pants and running from the scene.  The firearm later recovered from the bushes contained a palm print and DNA, both of which matched the defendant's."", ""Although the new witnesses suggest that Payne shot the victim, the judge did not credit their testimony.  Even assuming that the judge had credited Bizzell, part of his testimony was that the defendant had admitted to killing the victim.  In any event, the testimony of the three witnesses was not inconsistent with Payne merely taking credit for a shooting that he had asked his friend to carry out, and about which he later felt badly as his request had resulted in the defendant's incarceration.  In light of the strength of the forensic and testimonial evidence offered against the defendant at trial, we discern no abuse of discretion in the motion judge's conclusion that the new witnesses, who, years later, offered testimony implicating someone else, were neither credible nor material, and did not cast real doubt on the justice of the defendant's conviction.

Thus, this is not a basis for holding that the integrity of a grand jury proceeding was impaired.', 'This is so for two interrelated reasons.  First, as discussed supra, the role of the grand jury is limited.  They are no more than an investigatory and accusatory body.  See Lataille, 366 Mass. at 532.

Commonwealth v. Silva,', ', 511 (2009).  Nor is a prosecutor required to instruct the grand jury on the elements of any lesser included offenses.  Noble, 429 Mass. at 48.  Indeed, prosecutors are permitted to use the same indictment for charging the various degrees of homicide.  See Commonwealth v. DePace,', ', 743 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 980 (2005) (statutory form of indictment alleging murder is sufficient to charge murder under any theory and in any degree, as well as manslaughter).  Indeed, the degree of murder is properly determined by the petit jury, not the grand jury.  Noble, supra at 48.  McLeod, 394 Mass. 733, quoting Brunson, 369 Mass. at 120; G. L. c. 265, § 1 (""The degree of murder shall be found by the [petit] jury"").  As the defendant is neither entitled to have the grand jury instructed on the differences between the degrees of homicide, nor to have the lowest possible homicide charge returned, it follows that the defendant is not entitled to have the grand jury instructed on the significance of mitigating evidence presented that might cause the body to find probable cause for manslaughter rather than murder.', ""The dissent and Justice Cypher's concurrence represent very different views of the function of the grand jury and what it means for that function to be impaired.  Those views -- which occupy different ends of the spectrum of possible resolutions to this issue -- are unnecessarily extreme in comparison to the more moderate, and more appropriate, approach laid out supra."", 'In his dissent, Chief Justice Gants contends that the ""relevant inquiry is . . . whether the grand jury\'s decision to return an indictment for murder, rather than manslaughter, was \'probably influenced\' by the absence of legal guidance.""

As explained supra, the conclusion that the grand jury process is impaired only if the omitted legal instructions likely would have', 'Page 10', 'resulted in a no bill is based on prior holdings of this court pertaining to withheld exculpatory evidence.

See Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 621 (presentation of false or misleading evidence only impairs integrity of grand jury process if, among other things, it ""probably influenced the grand jury\'s determination to hand up an indictment"").', '', 'Citing to dicta in the concurring opinions in Walczak, the dissent reasons that ""[b]ecause mitigating evidence tends to cast doubt on the Commonwealth\'s proof regarding an essential element of a crime for which the Commonwealth seeks an indictment, it is exculpatory as to that crime.""  Post at 31-32, citing Walczak, 463 Mass. at 822-823 (Lenk, J., concurring), and id. at 839 (Gants, J., concurring).  Granted, there are important consequences to the degree of the charge, but the court heretofore has held that the question for the purposes of the impairment analysis is whether withheld evidence ""would likely have affected the grand jury\'s decision to indict,"" not whether they would have preferred to indict for a lesser version of the offense.  Post at 31-32.  See Clemmey, 447 Mass. at 130.  See also Noble, 429 Mass. at 48.  The dissent\'s reasoning is also directly contradicted by the practice in this Commonwealth of using the statutory form murder indictment to charge both degrees of murder (unless otherwise specified) and also manslaughter as a lesser included offense, see DePace, 442 Mass. at 743, and then leaving to the petit jury questions of the actual degree of culpability, whether it be murder in the first or second degree, manslaughter, or not guilty.  Noble, supra.', 'Moreover, the dissent relies on Walczak as support for its', 'Page 11', ""position that mitigating evidence should receive the same treatment as exculpatory evidence when determining impairment, post at 28-29, but this reliance is misplaced.  The majority in Walczak, 463 Mass. at 809-810, held that this was true with respect to juvenile defendants, but did not hold it to be so for adult defendants.  Only then Justice Gants and the two Justices who joined him in his concurrence would have applied this proposition to adult defendants.  Id. at 841 (Gants, J., concurring).  Justice Lenk's concurring opinion in that case, which was necessary to arrive at the holding of the majority, was firmly grounded in the unique consequences for juveniles facing indictments for murder rather than manslaughter; she did not subscribe to the view of Justice Gants in that case, that mitigating and exculpatory evidence should receive the same treatment in all cases."", 'See id. at 822-823 (Lenk, J., concurring).  It is therefore incorrect to claim that the holding in Walczak supports the proposition that grand jury proceedings for adult defendants are impaired where the omitted instructions relate to evidence that is merely mitigating and not wholly exculpatory.', '', ""In addition, the dissent's view conflates the roles of the grand jury and the petit jury.  The duty of the grand jury is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the crime alleged in the indictment has been committed."", 'See McCarthy, 385 Mass. at 163.  The petit jury, by contrast, uniquely are responsible for making the determination whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the indictment, of a lesser included offense, or', 'Page 12', 'not at all.  See Noble, 429 Mass. at 48; Colon-Cruz, 408 Mass. at 549.  Given this division of responsibility, the fact that a possible outcome of the grand jury process is that a defendant might be indicted for murder, only to be convicted of a lesser offense (e.g., manslaughter) at trial, does not call the integrity of that process into question.', 'Further, although the dissent purports to limit its rule to requiring instructions on mitigating evidence in murder cases, see post at 39, 40, where the failure to provide instructions might result in an indictment for murder rather than manslaughter, see id. at 40, there exists no principled reason for such a restriction.  Taken to its logical conclusion, the dissent\'s rule would appear also to require prosecutors to provide grand juries instructions for all lesser included offenses in all criminal cases to avoid impairing the integrity of the grand jury process.  See Noble, 429 Mass. at 48 (excessive judicial regulation of grand jury ""would add delay and complexity without serving any significant purpose"").', 'The dissent agrees, as does Justice Lowy in his concurrence, that, as a matter of best practices, instructions on both defenses and mitigating circumstances should be provided to grand juries, including instructions that might possibly affect the decision whether to indict for manslaughter as opposed to murder.  See note 1, supra.  However, the operative question on a motion to dismiss an indictment is whether the integrity of the grand jury proceedings has been impaired, not whether a prosecutor has conformed to the best practices, and the question whether the proceedings have been impaired is determined only by asking whether, had there been appropriate instructions, the grand jury would have returned no indictment at all.  See, e.g., Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 621-622 (presentation of false or misleading evidence, even if intentional, by itself does not require dismissal; defendant also must show that presentation of such evidence probably influenced decision to indict).  See also Clemmey, 447 Mass. at 130; McGahee, 393 Mass. at 746-747 (same).', 'At the other end of the spectrum from the dissent, the concurrence by Justice Cypher suggests that the integrity of the grand jury process should be considered impaired only where the prosecutor intentionally withholds instructions and providing them probably would result in a complete exoneration.  Post at 23.  This position, like that of the dissent, is not supported by our case law.', 'It is true that the intent of the prosecutor presenting the case to the grand jury is an important factor in determining whether', 'Page 13', 'dismissal of an indictment is required in circumstances like this.  In reviewing grand jury proceedings where false information was provided, or exculpatory evidence was withheld, we have required a showing that the conduct of the prosecutor was intentional and done for the purpose of obtaining an indictment.  See Clemmey, 447 Mass. at 130, and cases cited; Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 621, and cases cited.  In other words, the court must consider whether the prosecutor had actual possession or knowledge of the evidence, see Wilcox, 437 Mass. at 37, and, if so, whether the prosecutor withheld the evidence for valid reasons unrelated to the indictment.  See LaVelle, 414 Mass. at 150 (1993) (disclosure would have revealed identity of police informant).', ""However, reviewing grand jury proceedings where instructions on the law have been withheld does not lend itself to an inquiry regarding intentionality.  For example, in Walczak, 463 Mass. at 808, although we held that a prosecutor is obligated to provide instructions on the significance of any substantial mitigating evidence presented to the grand jury when seeking to indict a juvenile for murder, we did not require consideration whether the prosecutor committed misconduct in withholding such instructions.  Instructions on the law, unlike exculpatory evidence, are always available to the prosecution, so there is no question to be raised regarding the prosecutor's knowledge and intent.  See Commonwealth v. Kelcourse,"", ', 468-469 (1989). See also Commonwealth v. Reddington,', ', 319-320 (1985) (defendant failed to establish that law enforcement knew or should have known that evidence was false or inaccurate).  Moreover, prosecutors should be prepared to furnish instructions if the grand jury request them.  See Noble, 429 Mass. at 48.', 'Therefore, the relevant question is not whether the prosecution intentionally withheld the instructions, but instead whether the failure to give such instructions, regardless of intent, results in an indictment where otherwise the grand jury would have returned a no bill.  It is the result of the omission of the instructions, not the motive behind it, that determines whether the process has been impaired to the point that a dismissal is necessary.', 'This approach does not, as Justice Cypher contends, ""establish another mechanism to dismiss an indictment.""  Post at 18.  Instead, it does no more (or less) here than to undergird the court\'s duty to review grand jury proceedings where there is a claim that the integrity of the proceedings has been impaired, Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 619-620, and determine, consonant with the court\'s case', 'Page 14', 'law, what constitutes an impairment requiring dismissal.

The only cases affected by this approach will be those in which the exculpatory evidence is compelling enough that the absence of instructions on a complete defense probably would make a difference in the grand jury\'s decision to hand up an indictment; and as to those, one trusts that an indictment would not be sought -- at least it should not be sought -- in the first place.', 'Limiting judicial intervention to those indictments that enable ""needless or unfounded"" prosecutions is consonant with the role of the grand jury.

The Commonwealth also presented substantial evidence that could have been seen as exculpatory, comprising testimony from witnesses who observed bruises on the defendant,', 'Page 15', ""including on the night of the killing; statements from the defendant regarding the victim's abusive behavior toward her during their relationship; and the defendant's statement that she acted in self-defense."", 'When coupled with instructions from the judge at trial, the evidence presented may result in a petit jury finding the defendant guilty only of voluntary manslaughter (or not guilty of any offense).', 'See McLeod, 394 Mass. at 733 (availability of unprejudiced petit jury at trial obviates need for in-depth appellate scrutiny of all aspects of grand jury process).

However, in order for the defendant to prevail on a claim that the integrity of the grand jury proceedings was impaired here, she must demonstrate that, had the Commonwealth provided instructions on the legal significance of the exculpatory evidence presented, it would have resulted in a ""complete exoneration"" by the issuance of a no bill.

But an indictment should not be disturbed on the basis that, had the grand jury received instructions on the different types of homicide, they would have indicted the defendant for some lesser crime.', 'Given that the purpose of the grand jury is to determine probable cause and not guilt, the process here appears to have worked as designed.  That is, the grand jury determined that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime alleged in the indictment:  murder.  At trial, a petit jury will weigh the mitigating and exculpatory evidence, along with all the other evidence, to determine whether the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of murder or voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty of any offense.

I would not require such instructions, however, for the compelling reasons outlined in Justice Cypher's opinion."", 'Second, I believe that Justice Budd\'s conclusion is unwieldy at best, and perhaps even unworkable.

How then does a judge rule on what Justice Cypher is calling a ""Fernandes motion,"" post at 22, where exculpatory evidence, if believed, would result in a no bill?  Does the Commonwealth have to delay its grand jury presentation until the Commonwealth retains an expert on battered woman syndrome?  What if the exculpatory evidence is a defendant\'s statement to police made during custodial interrogation?  What if that statement cannot be reconciled with forensic and medical evidence?  What if, in a rape case, there is overwhelming evidence that the alleged victim was too impaired to consent and the defendant\'s own statement, inconsistent with a video recording of the incident, is that he was too impaired to recognize the victim\'s impairment?  See Commonwealth v. Blache,', ', 597 (2008) (""Commonwealth must prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant\'s condition rendered her incapable of consenting"").  Must a grand jury be instructed on Blache at the risk of a ""Fernandes dismissal""?  What if the defense is entrapment, accident, or selective prosecution?  Does the result in these circumstances depend on a motion judge\'s determinations of credibility?  That seems akin to adjudication.', ""Third, once this court intrudes on grand jury practice, absent insufficient evidence or impairment of the grand jury, we alter the function of the grand jury and detract from its historic role.

The plurality contends that the absence of any such instructions does not require the dismissal of the murder indictment without prejudice because instructions would likely not have resulted in the grand jury issuing a no bill.  I believe that the relevant inquiry is not whether the omitted legal instructions likely would have resulted in a no bill, but whether the grand jury\'s decision to return an indictment for murder, rather than manslaughter, was ""probably influenced"" by the absence of legal guidance.  Commonwealth v. Mayfield,', "", 621 (1986).

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.', 'Discussion.  1.  The grand jury process.  After presenting evidence to a grand jury, a prosecutor offers the grand jury a proposed indictment charging the defendant with a specific crime.  The grand jury must then evaluate the presented evidence and decide whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime charged.  In doing so, the grand jury must determine whether there is probable cause supporting each required element of the crime.  See Commonwealth v. Moran,', ', 884 (2009) (grand jury must be presented with evidence on each element of crime charged).  See also Commonwealth v. Washington W.,', "", 212-213 (2012) (considering whether withheld evidence was material to grand jury's finding of probable cause as to one required element of crime).  Where the grand jury so finds, they should return the proposed indictment charging that crime.  Where they do not, the grand jury must return a no bill or an indictment charging a lesser crime for which they do find probable cause.  Commonwealth v. McCarthy,"", ', 163 (1982) (""A grand jury finding of probable cause is necessary if indictments are to fulfil their traditional function as an effective protection against unfounded criminal prosecutions"" [quotation and citation omitted]).', 'Here, the prosecutor presented the grand jury with an indictment charging murder.  The language of some indictments sets forth all of the elements of the crime charged, and therefore provides the grand jury with legal guidance regarding the required elements for which probable cause must be found.  Compare, e.g., G. L. c. 277, § 79 (form indictment for breaking and entering in nighttime with intent to commit felony) with Commonwealth v. Cabrera,', ', 827 (2007) (describing elements of breaking and entering in nighttime with intent to commit felony).  But the language of a murder indictment, as authorized by statute, does not.  See G. L. c. 277, § 79.  The indictment here simply alleged that the defendant, on May 7, 2014, ""did assault and beat [the victim] with intent to murder him and by such assault and beating did kill and murder [the victim].""  In the absence of legal guidance, a reasonable grand juror would understand this language to mean that the required elements of murder are:  (1) that the defendant committed an assault and battery against the victim; (2) that, in doing so, the defendant intended to kill the victim; and (3) that the assault and battery caused the victim\'s death.', 'Page 26', 'But this reasonable understanding, based on the language of the standard murder indictment, is legally incorrect:  a required element of the crime of murder is that the defendant committed the killing with malice.  See Commonwealth v. Sires,', ', 296 (1992) (""malice is what makes an unlawful killing murder"").  Malice may be proved by establishing any one of three prongs:  (1) that the defendant intended to kill the victim; (2) that the defendant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim; or (3) that the defendant intended ""to do an act which, in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable person would have known created a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Williams,', ', 712 (2016).  But a killing is not committed with malice where it is committed in the heat of passion on reasonable provocation, where it is induced by sudden combat, or where the defendant uses excessive force in self-defense.  See Commonwealth v. Camacho,', ', 602 (2015).  Because a grand jury must be presented with evidence supporting a finding of probable cause with regard to each element of the crime charged, see Moran, 453 Mass. at 884, a grand jury may not return a murder indictment unless they find probable cause to believe that the defendant killed the victim with malice.  If the grand jury were to conclude that the defendant intended to kill the victim but that there was not probable cause to believe that she did so with malice, either because she used excessive force in self-defense or because she acted in the heat of passion on reasonable provocation or in sudden combat, they could indict the defendant for manslaughter but not for murder.', '', 'Moreover, the language of the indictment does not inform the grand jury that lawful self-defense is a complete defense. This', 'Page 27', ""means that even if there is probable cause to believe (1) that the defendant committed an assault and battery against the victim; (2) that, in doing so, the defendant intended to kill the victim; and (3) that the assault and battery caused the victim's death, the defendant may not be indicted for any homicide offense if the grand jury conclude that the defendant committed the killing in lawful self-defense (or, more precisely, conclude that there is not probable cause to believe that the defendant was not acting in lawful self-defense when she killed the victim).  See Commonwealth v. Little,"", ', 787 (2000) (""self-defense, if warranted by the circumstances and carried out properly, constitutes a complete defense"").', '2.  Exculpatory evidence.  The grand jury in this case heard substantial evidence to support a finding that the defendant acted in lawful self-defense or, alternatively, that she used excessive force in self-defense.  The grand jury learned that the defendant was engaged to be married to the victim, that she immediately reported the stabbing to her neighbors, that she appeared hysterical following the stabbing, and that, when asked what had happened, she told her neighbor that ""he hit me, so I hit him.""  The grand jury further learned that the defendant, soon after the victim was stabbed, informed police officers that the victim had threatened her with a gun and choked her immediately prior to the stabbing.  And the grand jury heard substantial evidence in support of this self-defense claim:  police officers located a gun on the couch at the residence; an officer noticed fresh bruises on the defendant\'s face and arm; the defendant had previously disclosed that the victim was physically abusive and had placed a gun in her mouth on multiple occasions; and the victim, days before the killing, had sent text messages to the defendant saying ""I\'m going to fucking kill you"" and ""You\'re dead.""', 'The significance of this exculpatory evidence is reflected in the fact that the Commonwealth, which was familiar with the circumstances of this case and with the law of murder and manslaughter, decided to charge the defendant with manslaughter in its complaint.', ""3.  Impairment of the integrity of the grand jury.  If the Commonwealth had sought an indictment for murder without disclosing any of the above-described surrounding circumstances to the grand jury (which, to the Commonwealth's credit, did not take place here), I believe there can be no doubt that the prosecutor would have impaired the integrity of the grand jury by failing to"", 'Page 28', 'present to them exculpatory evidence ""\'likely to affect the grand jury\'s decision,\' as well as evidence the withholding of which would cause the presentation to be seriously tainted.""

O'Dell,"", ', 449 (1984) (dismissing indictment where failure to introduce exculpatory evidence impaired integrity of grand jury).  Yet the plurality opinion concludes that even where the prosecutor sought an indictment for murder despite substantial evidence of self-defense and the excessive use of force in self-defense, the prosecutor had no obligation to provide the grand jury with any legal guidance regarding lawful self-defense or the excessive use of force in self-defense, or regarding the required elements of the crime of murder.', '', ""I believe that the prosecutor's obligation to furnish the grand jury with exculpatory evidence likely to affect the grand jury's decision includes the obligation to provide instructions enabling them to understand the legal significance of that evidence."", 'See Commonwealth v. Walczak,', ', 839 (2012) (Gants, J., concurring) (""Evidence of mitigating circumstances . . . is meaningless to a grand jury that have not been provided with the guidance necessary to understand its legal significance"").  In other words, I believe that if it would be an O\'Dell violation for a prosecutor to conceal significant exculpatory evidence from the grand jury in a murder case, it should be a Fernandes violation for a prosecutor to fail to explain the legal significance of that evidence, and I believe that either violation warrants dismissal of the indictment without prejudice.  I reach this conclusion because, where mitigating or exculpatory evidence is so significant that it must be introduced to avoid impairing the integrity of the grand', 'Page 29', 'jury proceedings, failure to explain the legal relevance of this evidence ""probably influenced"" the grand jury\'s decision to indict the defendant for murder and not manslaughter.', 'Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 621.', 'In reaching the contrary conclusion that instructions need to be provided only where they would likely result in a no bill, the plurality makes five errors.', 'a.  Overstatement of existing case law.  First, the plurality contends that my definition of what probably influences a grand jury\'s decision to indict ""does not comport with our case law.""  Ante at 9.  In fact, however, a majority of this court has never decided whether instructions on mitigating circumstances and defenses are necessary where the Commonwealth seeks to indict an adult defendant for murder and where there is substantial evidence that the defendant acted in self-defense or used excessive force in self-defense.  See Commonwealth v. Grassie,', ', 219 (2017) (declining to address this issue).  As the plurality acknowledges, ""we provided only limited guidance regarding legal instructions furnished to grand juries"" prior to holding in Walczak, 463 Mass. at 810, that prosecutors are required to instruct the grand jury on the elements of murder and on the significance of mitigating circumstances and defenses', 'Page 30', 'where the Commonwealth seeks to indict a juvenile for murder despite substantial evidence of mitigating circumstances or defenses.  Ante at 2. The question presented here, therefore, cannot be answered simply by applying our existing case law.  It is presumably for this reason that the plurality relies in large part on an out-of-state case, State v. Hogan, 336 N.J. Super. 319 (2001), decided by the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court, in arguing that instructions need be provided only when they would likely result in a no bill.  See ante at 7-8, 14, 15.', ""b.  Oversimplification of grand jury's decision.  Second, the plurality treats the grand jury's decision as binary:  whether to indict the defendant for a crime or to return a no bill.  The indictment presented to a grand jury, however, does not charge a generic crime -- it charges a specific crime, with specific required elements.  See Commonwealth v. Fryar,"", ', 744 (1993), S.C.,', ', cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1033 (1997) (Commonwealth must present grand jury with ""enough evidence to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed', '[emphasis added]).  It is therefore up to the grand jury to determine not only whether the defendant committed a crime, but which, if any, particular crime is supported by probable cause.  See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 263 (1986) (""In the hands of the grand jury lies the power to charge a greater offense or a lesser offense"").', 'The plurality\'s oversimplified approach to the grand jury\'s role leads it to conclude that a lack of instructions ""would likely have affected the grand jury\'s decision to indict,"" Clemmey, 447 Mass. at 130, only where such instructions would have informed the grand jury of what likely would have been a complete defense.  Ante at 7-8.  This standard fails to recognize the immense difference between a manslaughter and a murder indictment where the grand jury finds that only the former is supported by probable cause.  If convicted of murder, the defendant will be sentenced to life in prison and, if convicted of murder in the first degree, will have no possibility of parole.  See G. L. c. 265, § 2 (a), (c).  In contrast, if the defendant is convicted of manslaughter, she faces a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison, with no minimum mandatory sentence.  See G. L. c. 265, § 13.  Of course, a murder indictment will not necessarily result in a murder conviction.  But the stark difference between murder and manslaughter may affect not only the defendant\'s sentence upon conviction, but also the defendant\'s decision whether to plead guilty or go to trial.  Some', 'Page 31', 'defendants, even if they are not guilty, may be unwilling to risk a life sentence without the possibility of parole where the Commonwealth is willing to accept a guilty plea to murder in the second degree or manslaughter.  They may be more willing to risk trial, however, where the grand jury indict them for manslaughter rather than murder.', 'Furthermore, an indictment for manslaughter as opposed to murder is likely to yield more favorable plea options for a defendant, as the Commonwealth will no longer possess the threat of a life sentence as a negotiating tool.  ""In today\'s criminal justice system,"" where ""the negotiation of a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is almost always the critical point for a defendant,"" Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. 134, 144 (2012), this calculus is critical.  And importantly, it takes place before the petit jury enter the equation to ""weigh the mitigating and exculpatory evidence"" and ""determine whether the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of murder or voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty of any offense.""  Ante at 16.  I therefore believe that the grand jury\'s decision to indict is affected not only where legal instructions likely would have resulted in a no bill, but also where the grand jury\'s decision to issue an indictment for murder (as opposed to manslaughter) was ""probably influenced"" by the lack of legal guidance.  Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 621.  This standard reflects the grand jury\'s responsibility to decide whether the particular crime charged is supported by probable cause.  See Vasquez, 474 U.S. at 263.', 'c.  Distinction between mitigating and exculpatory evidence.  Third, the plurality contends that grand jury proceedings are not impaired where omitted instructions relate to evidence that is ""merely mitigating and not wholly exculpatory.""  Ante at 11.  I agree with the plurality that mitigating evidence is evidence that might reduce the gravity of the offense, while exculpatory evidence is evidence that might absolve the defendant from guilt altogether.  See ante at note 2.  But when it comes to the Commonwealth\'s duty to disclose evidence to a grand jury considering an indictment for murder, I believe that this is a distinction without a meaningful difference.', ""Because mitigating evidence tends to cast doubt on the Commonwealth's proof regarding an essential element of a crime for which the Commonwealth seeks an indictment, it is exculpatory as to that crime, and may cause a grand jury to conclude that only"", 'Page 32', 'a lesser crime is supported by probable cause.', 'See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 822-823 (Lenk, J., concurring) (requirement that significant, probably influential mitigating or exculpatory evidence be presented to grand jury ""assures that it can be considered by them in evaluating whether there is probable cause to return either the indictment sought or one for a lesser offense, or to return a no bill""); id. at 839 (Gants, J., concurring) (""A grand jury are entitled to hear such evidence where it is substantial and may be important to their decision whether to indict for murder or voluntary manslaughter"").  Here, where the prosecutor presented a murder indictment to the grand jury, so-called mitigating evidence suggesting that the defendant did not commit the killing with malice because she acted in self-defense or used excessive force in self-defense is exculpatory as to the crime of murder.  It must therefore be presented and explained to the grand jury where, as here, failure to do so probably influenced their decision to indict the defendant for murder.', ""d.  Grand jury's role in the criminal process.  Fourth, the plurality's opinion fails to honor the constitutional and statutory role of the grand jury.  See Jones v. Robbins,"", ', 342-349 (1857) (under art. 12 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, crimes punishable by term in State prison require grand jury indictment); G. L. c. 263, § 4.  The plurality, of course, is correct that the grand jury determine only probable cause, leaving it to the petit jury to determine whether the evidence at trial proves the defendant guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  The plurality is also correct that a defendant is not entitled to have the grand jury return the lowest possible charge; rather, the', 'Page 33', 'Commonwealth may instruct the grand jury to return an indictment for the charge presented, provided they find that the required elements of that charge are supported by probable cause.  See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 841 n.3 (Gants, J., concurring); id. at 847-848 (Spina, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  And the plurality also is correct that, where the grand jury indict a defendant for murder, the petit jury may find the defendant not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of the lesser included crimes of murder in the second degree or manslaughter.', 'But the grand jury are not a mere rubber stamp required to approve any indictment brought by the Commonwealth.  The prosecutor controls which indictment to present to the grand jury, but the grand jury control whether to return that indictment.  See Vasquez, 474 U.S. at 263.  Where they find that there is not probable cause to support a required element of a proposed charge, they should return a no bill or an indictment for a lesser included offense.  In the context of this case, this means that if the grand jury found that there was not probable cause to support a finding of malice because the defendant used excessive force in self-defense, the grand jury could return an indictment for manslaughter but not for murder.', 'The grand jury cannot perform their constitutional or statutory role of determining probable cause if they are deprived of important exculpatory evidence or of the legal guidance they need to understand that exculpatory evidence.  ""In contrast to a reviewing court\'s evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence, which views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a grand jury need not view the evidence in so favorable a light in deciding probable cause.""  Walczak, 463 Mass. at 841 n.3 (Gants, J., concurring).  Even where the evidence is legally sufficient to support an indictment for murder, as it was here, the circumstances of the killing may cause a grand jury to conclude that the credible evidence is insufficient to support a finding of probable cause as to the element of malice.  See id.  Where they so find after being properly instructed, the highest crime supported by probable cause is voluntary manslaughter.  See id.  A grand jury cannot reasonably decide whether there is probable cause to support a finding of malice, however, where substantial exculpatory evidence is unaccompanied by instructions explaining the elements of murder and, as relevant here, the legal consequences of acting in self-defense or using excessive force in self-defense.', 'It is true, as the plurality acknowledges, that prosecutors are required to provide the grand jury with legal instructions when', 'Page 34', 'the grand jury so requests.  See ante at 2, citing Commonwealth v. Noble,', ', 48 (1999).  But there is no reason to expect grand jurors to recognize that the elements in the murder indictment are not the required elements of murder, or to know enough about the law of homicide to ask the prosecutor to explain the element of malice.  ""It . . . makes no sense for a prosecutor to owe a duty to provide such a legal instruction only where the grand jury know enough about the law of homicide to ask for such an instruction.""  Walczak, 463 Mass. at 839 (Gants, J., concurring).  ""The law of homicide,"" after all, ""is too complex reasonably to expect a grand jury to know the legal significance of reasonable provocation or sudden combat [or excessive use of force in self-defense] without instruction by a prosecutor, or even to recognize that it may be an issue for which they should seek legal guidance.""  Id. at 839-840.', 'e.  Exculpatory evidence related to self-defense.  Fifth, the plurality acknowledges that there may be circumstances where ""the absence of instructions on a complete defense would make a difference in the grand jury\'s determination to hand up an indictment,"" and therefore where a prosecutor must instruct the grand jury on self-defense.  Ante at 14.  But the plurality goes on to determine that in this case, no instruction on self-defense was required because its absence likely did not make a difference in the grand jury\'s determination to return an indictment.  This is troubling, first, because the grand jury heard substantial evidence of self-defense -- namely, that the victim had a history of physically abusing the defendant, that the victim had beaten the defendant leading up to the stabbing, and that the victim was stabbed only after he attacked the defendant with weapons.  If this type of evidence does not suffice to require prosecutors to provide the grand jury with instructions on the issue of self-defense, it is not apparent what circumstances would.', '', 'Equally troubling is the fact that the plurality, by requiring instructions only on complete defenses, asks prosecutors to do the', 'Page 35', 'impossible:  clearly distinguish between evidence of lawful self-defense and evidence of excessive use of force in self-defense.  See ante at note 11 (prosecutors obligated ""to discern where substantial exculpatory evidence they have presented gives rise to a defense that could reasonably result in a no bill, and to instruct the grand juries accordingly"").  As the plurality acknowledges, however, exculpatory evidence showing that the defendant acted in lawful self-defense necessarily overlaps with exculpatory evidence showing that the defendant used excessive force while acting in self-defense.  See Commonwealth v. Johnson,', ', 372 (1992) (""self-defense is not an all or nothing proposition . . . once the issue of self-defense has been fairly raised, the jury should be instructed on the legal consequence of using manifestly disproportionate violence in the supposed exercise"" of self-defense [quotations, citations, and alteration omitted]).', '4.  Implications of proposed standards.  The plurality declares that, unless the defendant is a juvenile, prosecutors have no obligation to instruct the grand jury on the elements of the charged offense and lesser offenses even where there is powerful exculpatory evidence that likely would make a difference in the grand jury\'s determination to return an indictment for murder rather than manslaughter.  Yet, the plurality then ""strongly encourage[s] district attorneys making grand jury presentments"" to consider instructing the grand jury ""on the elements of lesser offenses and/or defenses, where such instructions would be in the interest of justice or would assist the grand jurors to understand the legal significance of mitigating circumstances and defenses.""  Ante at note 1, quoting Supreme Judicial Court Committee on Grand Jury Proceedings, Final Report to the Justices, at 13 (June 2018) (Grand Jury Report).  I, too, strongly encourage district attorneys to provide these instructions, but I do so because I recognize that failing to provide instruction where there is substantial exculpatory evidence may impair the integrity of the grand jury.', 'Page 36', ""The plurality's approach -- encouraging prosecutors to provide legal instructions where there is substantial exculpatory and mitigating evidence but not penalizing a failure to do so unless instructions would likely have resulted in a no bill -- is unlikely to have its intended effect.  Previously, we had left to another day the question whether an adult defendant indicted for murder could have his or her indictment dismissed due to a lack of legal instructions on mitigating circumstances and defenses.  See Grassie, 476 Mass. at 219.  A prudent prosecutor thus may have thought that providing instructions was the safer route.  Now, however, prosecutors will know that there will rarely be consequences for failing to instruct on mitigating circumstances and defenses, even where substantial evidence of self-defense or excessive use of force in self-defense is presented.  I am therefore skeptical that the number of prosecutors who choose to provide legal guidance without being requested to do so by the grand jury will increase, despite the plurality's suggested best practice."", 'Moreover, if prosecutors come to the grand jury unprepared to furnish legal instructions, grand jurors will be less able to fulfill their constitutional function, and the risk that a prosecutor will inadvertently misstate the law in answer to a grand juror\'s question will be greater.  And that error itself creates a risk that the indictment will be dismissed.  After our decision in Grassie, 476 Mass. at 220, the entirety of the grand jury proceeding apart from deliberations must ""be recorded in a manner that permits reproduction and transcription.""  This includes ""any legal instructions provided to the grand jury by a judge or a prosecutor in connection with the proceeding.""  Id.  If the prosecutor\'s legal instructions are substantially incorrect or misleading, the error might require dismissal of the indictment without prejudice upon review of the recorded proceeding.

In the absence of egregious prosecutorial misconduct, which has not been alleged here, the remedy would be a dismissal without prejudice.  See O'Dell, 392 Mass. at 447.  This means that the Commonwealth, which has already presented evidence in this case to multiple grand juries, could present the evidence and appropriate legal instructions to another grand jury, and then ask that grand jury to return a murder indictment."", 'The obligation to provide guidance regarding the legal significance of mitigating or exculpatory evidence imposes only a modest burden on prosecutors.  See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 833 (Lenk, J., concurring) (""instructional requirement imposes scant burden on the Commonwealth"").  It applies only where there exists exculpatory or mitigating evidence of such significance that withholding it from the grand jury would impair the proceeding\'s integrity.

The Supreme Judicial Court Committee on Grand Jury Proceedings, which was created to help the court ""gain[] a better understanding of current practices employed by the various district attorneys and the Attorney General"" in grand jury proceedings, Grassie, 476 Mass. at 219, noted in its final report that ""[m]any District Attorney offices currently instruct the grand jury on the elements of the offense, especially where the elements are not apparent from the language of the indictment or are not offenses commonly presented to the grand jury.""', 'Grand Jury Report, supra at 28.', 'The burden on prosecutors is even less when one recognizes that a prosecutor should already be prepared to provide appropriate legal instructions if a grand juror were to ask about the legal significance of exculpatory or mitigating evidence.

See ante at note 15.  If grand jurors' requests for instructions increase, the modest burden imposed by a requirement that instructions be presented in certain limited circumstances would only decrease."", 'Furthermore, when presenting before the grand jury, the prosecutor need not provide legal guidance ""with the same degree of precision that is required when a petit jury [are] instructed on the law"" (citation omitted).

Matter of Pappas,', ', 613 (1971), aff\'d sub nom. Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972).  We have long recognized that a prosecutor does not have the discretion to conceal important exculpatory or mitigating evidence where doing so would impair the integrity of the grand jury.  See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 822 (Lenk, J., concurring); Wilcox, 437 Mass. at 37; Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 620-621; O\'Dell, 392 Mass. at 449.  We recognized more recently that a prosecutor, at least in juvenile murder cases, does not have the discretion to impair the integrity of a grand jury by failing to provide legal instructions necessary for the grand jury to recognize the legal significance of such evidence.  See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 810.  ""By providing legal instructions[,] the prosecutor enables the grand jury to meaningfully apply the facts to the law, thus assisting the grand jury to fulfill its role as a \'bulwark of individual liberty and a fundamental protection against despotism and persecution.\'""  Grand Jury Report, supra at 22, quoting Wilcox, 437 Mass. at 34.', 'Page 39', ""I therefore do not believe that requiring prosecutors to provide legal instructions in the narrow circumstances described herein improperly encroaches on the Commonwealth's role in the indictment process."", ""There is little reason to fear that application of my proposed standard will yield a floodgate of motions to dismiss indictments, or will otherwise significantly burden Superior Court judges.  No doubt, comparable fears were aired when this court allowed defendants to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of probable cause in McCarthy, 385 Mass. at 162-163, and the concealment of exculpatory evidence in O'Dell, 392 Mass. at 449, and those fears ultimately proved groundless.  There are at least three reasons to believe that comparable fears will prove equally groundless here."", ""First, as already noted, a prosecutor's obligation to provide guidance regarding the legal significance of important exculpatory or mitigating evidence is triggered only in that fraction of cases where such evidence exists."", 'Second, such motions to dismiss are unlikely to prevail.  So long as prosecutors provide the grand jury with proper legal guidance where necessary, there is little risk of error warranting dismissal of the indictment.  In fact, the risk of error will be diminished if prosecutors initiate such legal instructions themselves rather than wait for a legal question from the grand jury, which they may be less prepared to answer.', ""Third, in the absence of egregious prosecutorial misconduct, the allowance of a motion to dismiss will result only in the dismissal of the indictment without prejudice; the Commonwealth may seek the same indictment from a different grand jury by presenting the same evidence and furnishing the required legal guidance.  See O'Dell, 392 Mass. at 447.  Consequently, unless there is a significant chance that a new grand jury will return a no bill or indict the defendant on a lesser charge if properly instructed, defendants will incur little benefit from bringing such a motion."", 'Finally, the Commonwealth contends that the Superior Court judge improperly relied on Walczak to dismiss the murder indictment because our decision in Walczak obligated the Commonwealth to provide legal instructions only in future juvenile murder cases where there was substantial evidence of mitigating circumstances or defenses presented to the grand jury.  See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 810.  This obligation, the Commonwealth argues, did not apply to cases such as this one, where the Commonwealth sought', 'Page 40', 'to indict an adult for murder.', ""In Walczak, however, we affirmed the judge's dismissal of the juvenile's murder indictment even though we applied the court's newly-created rule regarding required legal instructions only to future juvenile cases.  Id.  There would be nothing unfair about doing the same here with respect to an adult murder indictment."", 'In fact, the importance of such legal guidance to the interests of justice was demonstrated in the Walczak case.  Without legal instruction, the grand jury indicted the juvenile for murder.  See Walczak, 463 Mass. at 809.  After the indictment was dismissed without prejudice due to the absence of instructions on the law distinguishing murder from manslaughter, the grand jury indicted the juvenile for manslaughter.  The defendant was subsequently found not guilty of this charge following a Juvenile Court jury trial.', 'Conclusion.  I would hold that the integrity of the grand jury proceedings was impaired by the Commonwealth\'s failure to provide legal instructions concerning self-defense and the excessive use of force in self-defense.  Because the grand jury\'s decision to return an indictment for murder was ""probably influenced"" by the absence of this legal guidance, see Mayfield, 398 Mass. at 621, I would dismiss the indictment without prejudice and allow a grand jury with proper legal instruction to decide whether the defendant should be indicted and, if so, whether the indictment should be for murder or manslaughter.

Law enforcement officers may forcibly enter a suspect's home if they have an arrest warrant for him and reason to believe that he is there. Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980).

The forcible entry into the apartment was only to arrest Brandon. The question then becomes whether the evidence seized as a result of the forced entry to arrest Brandon can be used against the defendant, who apparently had a reasonable expectation of privacy as an overnight guest in the apartment.', 'See Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 98 (1990) (""an overnight guest has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his host\'s home""). See also Steagald, supra at 219 (""The issue here . . . is not whether the subject of an arrest warrant can object to the absence of a search warrant when he is apprehended in another person\'s home, but rather whether the residents of that home can complain of the search"").', 'In this case, we conclude that there were exigent circumstances justifying the police entry into 36A Gibbs Street to apprehend Brandon, and therefore the entry does not require suppression of the evidence seized as a result of it. ""To support a warrantless search on the basis of exigent circumstances, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that the police had probable cause and were faced with exigent circumstances such as danger to their lives, danger to the lives of others, or the destruction of evidence, such that it would be impracticable to obtain a warrant."" Commonwealth v. Moore,', ', 338 (2002).', 'Probable cause that Brandon had committed a crime involving a shooting was established by the arrest warrant. The Commonwealth also demonstrated that the police were faced with exigent circumstances that presented a danger to them or others. ""Factors [that] . . . tend[] to support a finding of exigency include a showing that the crime was one of violence or that the suspect was armed, a clear demonstration of probable cause, strong reason to believe that the suspect was in the dwelling, and a likelihood that the suspect would escape if not apprehended. Additional considerations testing the reasonableness of police conduct are whether', 'Page 94', 'the entry is peaceable and whether the entry is in the nighttime."" Commonwealth v. Forde,', ', 807 (1975).', '', ""The crime for which the arrest warrants were issued was extremely violent. Using a gun handed to him by Brandon, the defendant was accused of shooting his mother's landlord three times in the leg.

Commonwealth v. Cataldo,', ', 471 (2007) (apprehension of defendant without finding gun used in prior crime on his person increased probability that it was in his home). Moreover, there was also a ""strong reason"" to believe that Brandon was inside the apartment. Commonwealth v. Forde, supra. The officers were also legitimately concerned about Brandon escaping. Brandon and the defendant were taking precautions to avoid being apprehended by the police, as demonstrated by their moving into Chicklis\'s apartment and the defendant\'s lying across the back seat of the car when he left the apartment. Finally, the entry (although not peaceable) was made during the daytime. In sum, the police had probable cause to believe that Brandon had committed a crime of violence, and exigent circumstances justified immediate action. Their forcible entry, after they knocked and announced their presence and heard a loud commotion coming from within the apartment but received no response, was also reasonable under the circumstances.', '', 'Once inside the apartment, the officers conducted a protective', 'Page 95', 'sweep that the motion judge found reasonable in both time and scope. We agree. They searched for nothing other than Brandon, a fugitive for whom they had an arrest warrant, and stopped after they apprehended him.

On appeal, the defendant claims that Chicklis did not have the authority to consent to the search of his Doctor Seuss backpack in which 358.49 grams of cocaine, fifty MDMA tablets, and ammunition were found.

Yehudi Y.,', ', 816 (2002). Chicklis, as the lawful tenant of the apartment, had the actual authority to consent to the search of her apartment. As found by the judge, her consent was freely and voluntarily given and the scope of her consent to search within the apartment was unlimited. See Commonwealth v. Sanna,', ', 98-99 (1997). This consent extended to packages and closed containers within her control. See Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991) (""[t]he scope of a search is generally defined by its expressed object""; defendant\'s general consent to search his car for drugs included containers within the car that might conceal drugs); Commonwealth v. Gaynor,', ', 255 (2005).', 'Chicklis did not, however, have actual authority to permit the officers to search the Doctor Seuss backpack if the defendant had exclusive use and control of it. The question then becomes whether Chicklis had the apparent authority to allow the search', 'Page 96', 'of the backpack. The standard for apparent authority is whether ""the facts available to the officer at the moment . . . \'warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\' that the consenting party had authority"" to allow the search of the property. Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 188 (1990), quoting from Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968). See Commonwealth v. Rogers,', ', 249 (2005) (Greaney, J., dissenting). ""The focus is on the consenting person\'s relationship to the premises or items."" Grasso & McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law § 11-2[b] (2008). Here, the consenting person was the lawful occupant of the apartment, and the item to be searched was a child\'s backpack found in the kitchen of the apartment. The consenting person was also the mother of a child living in the apartment.', 'According to the defendant, the officers could not have reasonably believed that Chicklis had authority to consent to the search of his backpack. He contends that, at the time of the search, the police knew that he and his brother were staying with Chicklis and that their backpacks were in the kitchen. While there is evidence that Chicklis knew that the Dejarnettes had put their backpacks in the kitchen and that she conveyed this to police after the search when she gave them a statement, there was no indication that she mentioned the backpacks to the officers prior to the search. She did tell the officers that one of her children lived with her. Armed with this knowledge, it was reasonable for the officers to believe that a Doctor Seuss backpack in plain view on the kitchen floor belonged to her daughter and that Chicklis had the authority to consent to its search. Cf. Commonwealth v. Ortiz,', "", 70 (1996) (parent's ability to consent to search of child's room). Their reasonable reliance on her apparent authority did not invalidate the search. The denial of the defendant's suppression motion is affirmed."", ""2. Admission of William Coleman's statement. William Coleman was Chicklis's boyfriend and was also present in her apartment on the day of the search. Following the search, Coleman gave a statement to the police. In that statement, Coleman said that he did not live in the apartment, but stayed with Chicklis now and then, and that the defendant had been around for the last two weeks or so and was sleeping on Chicklis's couch."", 'Page 97', 'When asked who the drugs belonged to, Coleman responded, ""I heard [the defendant] is a dealer [and] he deals coke. I smoke weed with him and Jen[\']s brother (Julius) and [Coleman\'s friend] Fish. I\'ve never seen him deal."" Coleman also told the police that he had been in the bedroom safe, but that he did not know the combination. When asked if he saw anyone else go into the safe, Coleman said that he had not, but added that he had seen the defendant in the closet a few times and the only reason to go into that closet would be to use the safe.', 'Coleman also told the officer that he did not know whose cocaine was on the kitchen table, whose backpack was found in the kitchen, or whose gun was in the safe. He further stated that he had never seen the defendant with a gun in the house but he had seen him with a small gun on some other occasion. When asked if there was any reason why his fingerprints would be found on any of the contraband in the apartment, Coleman replied, ""The [w]eed bag will have my prints because I smoke weed and I moved it on the table. It was about a 6"" bag (one gal). The [c]oke I might have moved on the table also. Because Fish does \'P\' ([c]oke) only a small bag or so."" When asked who else\'s prints would be on the contraband, Coleman said he thought Fish\'s prints would be on the cocaine and marijuana.', 'Coleman was unavailable for trial because he invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant wanted to offer Coleman\'s declaration that his own fingerprints would be found on some of the drugs in the apartment under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. The Commonwealth had no objection so long as the entire statement was admitted. The trial judge replied that he ""certainly wouldn\'t allow on the theory of declaration against interest selected portions of the statement to come in"" and that if some of Coleman\'s statements came in, then the Commonwealth might have the right to put in other statements damaging to the defendant ""in an effort not to give the jury a distorted version of what [Coleman] said."" Defense counsel did not object and, after consulting with the defendant, he agreed that ""[b]y right, if I allude to a portion of this, the whole thing should come in.""', ""The defendant now claims that the judge erred by admitting Coleman's entire statement and that his trial counsel acted ineffectively"", 'Page 98', 'by introducing it. Relying on Commonwealth v. Marrero,', ""(2003), the defendant argues that only Coleman's declarations that his fingerprints would be found on the marijuana and possibly on the cocaine were admissible as declarations against his penal interest. He contends that the remainder of the statement should not have been admitted."", ""In Marrero, the defendant offered an unavailable witness's entire statement to police. The trial judge refused to allow any of the statement into evidence because only one isolated, irrelevant declaration was incriminating. We agreed that the defendant could not use one irrelevant declaration against penal interest to get the rest of an otherwise noninculpatory statement into evidence. Id. at 230."", ""In the instant case, the arguably self-inculpatory statements were not irrelevant. Coleman's statements regarding his fingerprints on the marijuana and cocaine were relevant as they provided some support for shifting at least some responsibility for the marijuana and cocaine found in the apartment, but outside the Doctor Seuss backpack, from the defendant to Coleman. In fact, the judge entered a required finding of not guilty on the defendant's marijuana count at the close of the Commonwealth's case."", 'The larger narrative in which these statements were made, however, was clearly self-exculpatory, not self-inculpatory. As he was being questioned by police in an apartment where there was substantial evidence of drug trafficking and distribution, and firearms and ammunition, he admitted only to some use of marijuana and possibly the touching of a bag of cocaine. The thrust of the statement was to shift the focus of responsibility for the drugs and gun found in the apartment to the defendant.', 'The United States Supreme Court has been cautious about admitting statements in which self-inculpatory and self-exculpatory statements are combined. ""[Federal Rule of Evidence] 804(b)(3) is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true."" Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 599 (1994). See Mass. G. Evid. § 804(b)(3) (2008-2009). Nonetheless, ""[o]ne of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seems particularly', 'Page 99', 'persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature."" Williamson, supra at 599-600. Consequently, ""when part of the confession is actually self-exculpatory, the generalization on which Rule 804(b)(3) is founded becomes even less applicable. Self-exculpatory statements are exactly the ones which people are most likely to make even when they are false; and mere proximity to other, self-inculpatory, statements does not increase the plausibility of the self- exculpatory statements."" Id. at 600.', 'The solution for the Supreme Court, at least when confronted with a ""broadly self-inculpatory confession,"" is to allow only the self-inculpatory statements to be admitted and to exclude the surrounding self-exculpatory statements. Id. at 599. See Commonwealth v. Charles,', ', 677 (1999) (only the part of the testimony containing declarations against penal interest properly admissible). Here however the statement is not broadly self-inculpatory, but rather extremely narrowly so.', 'In these circumstances, the trial judge was understandably hesitant to allow the narrowly self-inculpatory statements in as declarations against interest. This was a close call and it would have been within his discretion either to declare the statement proposed by defense counsel regarding smoking marijuana and touching the bag of cocaine to be inadmissible in the circumstances because it was not actually a declaration against interest, or to allow it in with some limited ""necessary surrounding context"" to prevent its significance from being distorted by defense counsel. See Commonwealth v. Marrerro, 60 Mass. App. Ct. at 229. Nevertheless, the solution proposed by the prosecution, and agreed to by the defendant, to allow the whole statement in evidence was erroneous. Williamson, supra at 600. Commonwealth v. Charles, 428 Mass. at 677.', 'Regardless, we do not consider the admission in evidence of the entire statement to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must establish that ""there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel -- behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer -- and . . . [that incompetency] has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial', 'Page 100', 'ground of defence."" Commonwealth v. Saferian,', ', 96 (1974). ""When arguably reasoned tactical or strategic judgments of counsel are called into question, such judgments must be shown to be manifestly unreasonable when made."" Commonwealth v. Henley,', ', 8 (2005). We cannot say that the trade-off here was manifestly unreasonable particularly in light of the required finding of not guilty on the marijuana charge. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Adams,', ', 729-730 (1978); Henley, supra at 9-10.', ""As the judge observed, the declarations that Coleman's fingerprints would be found on the bag of marijuana and possibly also on the cocaine supported the defendant's position that the drugs belonged to Coleman and not him. The other statements by Coleman incriminating the defendant could be portrayed as self-serving attempts to shift blame. They also duplicated other evidence. To avoid having witnesses testify to the shooting in which the defendant used the gun found in the safe, the parties entered into a stipulation that the defendant had possessed the gun twelve days prior to its discovery in the safe. That rendered Coleman's statement about the defendant's prior possession of a gun somewhat redundant. Although Coleman's statement that he had heard the defendant was a cocaine dealer is more problematic, Coleman had stated that he had not seen the defendant dealing. More importantly, there was ample evidence of the defendant's drug trafficking, particularly the drug-filled backpack with the defendant's name in it, his fingerprint found on one of the bags of cocaine in the backpack, and notebooks containing documents belonging to the defendant and numeric notations consistent with drug trafficking. Additionally the defendant was arrested with $2,575 on his person."", '3. Delayed disclosure of exculpatory evidence. The defendant next claims that the Commonwealth\'s failure to disclose evidence of promises, rewards, and inducements given to Chicklis until two months before trial merits dismissal of the indictments. It was within the motion judge\'s discretion to deny the defendant\'s motion to dismiss because the defendant failed to show ""irremediable harm to [his] opportunity to obtain a fair trial"" or point to any evidence that the delayed disclosure was ""egregious, deliberate, and intentional."" Commonwealth v. Cronk,', ',', 'Page 101', '198-199 (1985). The Commonwealth disclosed the evidence sufficiently in advance of trial that the defendant was able to cross-examine Chicklis extensively. See id. at 200 (""test of timeliness of prosecutorial disclosure is whether the defendant is able to make effective use of the evidence in preparing and presenting [his] case"").', ""We also find no merit to the defendant's claim that the failure to provide him the information prior to his suppression hearing requires dismissal of the indictments. The motion judge relied not only on Chicklis's testimony and her demeanor but on the testimony of the three other witnesses. The testimony consistently established that she freely and voluntarily consented to the search of the apartment. The defendant also could have sought reconsideration of his suppression motion but failed to do so. Commonwealth v. Haskell,"", "", 792-793 (2003) (within judge's discretion to reconsider denial of defendant's motion to suppress five years after motion was denied). There was no error in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictments."", '4. Remaining claims. The defendant claims that the trial judge committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit, as past recollection recorded, a police report from one of the officers at the scene identifying the safe as the location in which the cocaine, MDMA, and bag of ammunition were found rather than the Doctor Seuss backpack. The trial judge properly excluded the report from evidence because it was offered without proper foundation. Commonwealth v. Morgan,', ', 366 (2007) (requirements for admitting hearsay as a past recollection recorded).', '', ""The defendant's claim that he was denied his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine Chicklis is also unavailing."", 'Page 102', 'He was given an ample opportunity to cross-examine Chicklis for bias, her involvement in the drug trade, and any rewards and inducements given by the government. The judge was well within his discretionary authority to preclude additional speculative avenues of inquiry regarding how and why Chicklis was able and willing to post bond for Coleman and another alleged drug dealer in unrelated cases.', '', ""Conclusion.

At trial, over the defendant's objections, five certificates of analysis from the State crime laboratory"", 'Page 241', 'were introduced by the Commonwealth and admitted in evidence.', ""The certificates stated that the substances seized by police and connected to the defendant were cocaine of specific weights and marijuana. The admission of this evidence without testimony from the analyst was constitutional error, as it violated the defendant's rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (admission of laboratory certificates without live testimony by analyst violated confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment)."", '""The admission of testimony obtained in violation of a defendant\'s confrontation rights will not amount to reversible error if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."" Commonwealth v. Rosario,', ', 511 (1999) (citation and quotation marks omitted). A court must determine ""whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction,"" or put differently, ""whether overwhelming evidence of the defendant\'s guilt exists without the erroneously admitted evidence."" Commonwealth v. Perez,', ', 260 (1991). In making this determination, the Supreme Judicial Court has identified the following factors to consider: ""(1) the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; (2) who introduced the issue at trial; (3) the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt; (4) the frequency of the reference; and (5) the availability or effect of curative instructions."" Commonwealth v. Isabelle,', ', 419 (2005), quoting from Commonwealth v. Mahdi,', ', 696- 697 (1983).', 'We begin with the convictions involving cocaine. The conviction of trafficking in a net weight of 100 grams or more but less than 200 grams related to the cocaine found at 103 Vesey Street. The possession with intent to distribute conviction, as well as the school zone violation, involved the five bags that the defendant attempted to swallow at 1380 Main Street.', 'With respect to the trafficking conviction, in the absence of other direct or indirect evidence of the weight of the cocaine,', 'Page 242', 'we cannot conclude that the admission of the cocaine certificates was harmless. The certificates established that there were over 106 grams of cocaine in one bag and over thirty grams in other containers. See note 4, supra. Without the certificates, however, determining the weights of the amounts at issue, particularly whether they were over or under 100 grams, would involve too much guesswork on too close a question in these circumstances. Compare Commonwealth v. Connolly,', ', 831-832 (2009) (harmless error to introduce certificate where jury could determine that ""large, hard ball"" of cocaine weighed more than four ounces, and officer provided testimony converting ounces to grams). Consequently, there was not overwhelming other evidence of guilt of trafficking in a net weight of 100 grams or more.', 'We therefore reverse the trafficking conviction. The Commonwealth may, however, retry the defendant on this count. See Kater v. Commonwealth,', ', 18 (1995) (""If the evidence admitted at the trial was sufficient to send the case to the jury, but is insufficient to send the case to the jury if all improperly admitted evidence is disregarded, double jeopardy principles nevertheless do not bar a retrial""). See also Commonwealth v. DiBenedetto,', ', 45 (1992), S.C.,', '(1998), and cases cited therein (same).', 'We next consider the question whether the admission of the certificates by the Commonwealth was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt on the cocaine distribution and school zone counts related to the substance the defendant sought to swallow at 1380 Main Street. We again begin our analysis with the other evidence of guilt. On the distribution charge, unlike the trafficking count, the fact finder did not need to calculate the weight of the substance. In this context, the defendant\'s admission to drug dealing, as the police searched his residence, becomes significant. As Detective DiLiddo testified, ""At that point [the defendant] had apologized to me for the conduct that was going on,"" and he ""said that just his acts and things were very stupid as far as doing the drug dealing across the street."" The detective later explained, ""Well, most of the confession, I guess you\'d say was first an apology to me and my family for selling drugs.""', 'Page 243', 'There was also ample circumstantial evidence of cocaine distribution. See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, supra at 2542 n.14 (in declining to decide whether admission of drug certificate was harmless, United States Supreme Court went on to note that ""[t]oday\'s opinion . . . in no way alters the type of evidence [including circumstantial evidence] sufficient to sustain a conviction""). The defendant was apprehended by State troopers at 1380 Main Street after attempting to swallow five bags of suspected cocaine. Detective Thomas Keating, who was qualified as an expert, explained that powdered cocaine is typically packaged for sale as ""forties and fifties"" in ""plastic baggies"" and that delivery services, which ""meet usually in an isolated neighborhood [or] a parking lot . . . [or] go right to the location where the person is,"" are commonly used to distribute powdered cocaine.', ""He further testified that drug dealers often attempt to swallow bags of cocaine if confronted by police while en route to these locations. The defendant's behavior prior to and during his apprehension in the lobby of the apartment building was thus consistent with possession with intent to distribute cocaine."", 'Further circumstantial evidence was found in the defendant\'s basement at 103 Vesey Street. There the items seized included a coffee creamer container holding suspected cocaine and a metal tin containing a scale, bags of suspected cocaine, a green herb suspected to be marijuana, and $1,000. Police also seized a box of sandwich bags, three sifters, and a ""large bag"" of suspected cocaine. At least some of the substances were field tested and found to be cocaine. Detective DiLiddo so testified on cross-examination without objection. It is not, however, clear from the record who field tested the cocaine. Contrast Commonwealth v. Connolly, 454 Mass. at 831 (where officers who field tested cocaine were identified and testified).', 'The trial defense itself further supports a finding of harmless error. Beyond objecting to the certificates, the premise of the defense was not so much the nature of the substance that the defendant tried to swallow, but whether the defendant possessed it for personal use, possibly during what counsel referred to as a ""cocaine binge."" See Commonwealth v. Diaz,', ',', 'Page 244', '274 (2009). See also Commonwealth v. Isabelle, 444 Mass. at 419.', ""More problematic is the frequency of the references to drug certificates. The Commonwealth's introduction of five different drug certificates compounded the effect of the error. Nonetheless, we conclude that even these multiple references to different drug certificates are neutralized by the overwhelming evidence of cocaine distribution in this case."", '', ""In sum, the defendant's admission to drug dealing, his attempt to swallow the drugs in the lobby of 1380 Main Street, the expert testimony regarding the significance of the packaging and swallowing of the drugs, the seizure of drug paraphernalia and suspected cocaine in the defendant's basement, the uncontested testimony regarding field testing of the suspected substance as cocaine, and the defense itself, which raised the possibility of a cocaine binge, provided cumulative and overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt on the cocaine distribution charges. The erroneous admission of the cocaine certificates related to these charges was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."", 'Finally, we address the defendant\'s conviction of possession of marijuana. This count was not a focal point of the trial and was addressed in an abbreviated fashion. A narcotics detective was called to the stand. After a few questions that established that he had been a police officer for twelve years and a narcotics officer for eight years, he testified that ""a green herb"" was found in the defendant\'s basement in the tin that also contained bags of suspected cocaine, a scale, and $1,000. The officer was not asked to describe the smell or other attributes of the green herb. Nor was he asked to identify it based on his experience as a narcotics officer. Unlike the detective who testified regarding the cocaine, his expertise was not in any way established beyond his years of experience as a narcotics officer. Thereafter, the suspected marijuana and the marijuana certificate were admitted, but without further explanation or even a direct connection being expressly made between the two. To clarify matters, the judge, who was the trier of fact, asked the detective who had identified the substance, ""I\'m sorry, that\'s [marijuana], right? That\'s marijuana?"" The', 'Page 245', 'detective replied in the affirmative. There was no objection to this exchange.', ""We conclude that the proof that the substance was marijuana was too dependent on the erroneous admission of the certificate to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Isabella, supra at 419. Here the Commonwealth relied almost exclusively on the certificate to prove that the substance was marijuana. There was little done to establish or apply the officer's expertise. Compare Commonwealth v. Dawson,"", ', 467 (1987); Commonwealth v. Cantres,', "", 245-246 (1989). The judge was therefore dependent on the certificate, which the Commonwealth introduced over the defendant's objection."", 'The other relevant factors also favor the defendant. As previously discussed, the multiple drug certificates introduced by the Commonwealth compounded the effect of the error. Additionally, although the premise of the defense to the charge of possession of marijuana appeared, in part, to be that all the drugs in the basement belonged to other individuals, the defendant did not concede that the green herb was marijuana or otherwise undercut his defense. In these circumstances, the admission of the marijuana certificate was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', '', ""5. Redirect examination. The defendant's final claim is that the trial judge abused her discretion by allowing the Commonwealth to introduce testimony about the school zone measurement for the first time on redirect examination."", '', 'While the purpose of redirect examination is to give witnesses an opportunity to explain or correct testimony given on cross-examination, redirect examination may exceed the scope of cross-examination.', 'Commonwealth v. Hoffer,', ', 375 (1978). The trial judge has discretion to permit or limit questioning on redirect examination. Commonwealth v. Smith,', ', 479 (1952). Commonwealth v. Hoffer, supra. To prove an', 'Page 246', ""abuse of the trial judge's discretion, the defendant must show prejudice. Commonwealth v. Smith, supra."", ""The defendant has not shown how the trial judge's ruling unfairly prejudiced him. The defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine Detective DiLiddo on his school zone measurement testimony. Moreover, even if the judge had sustained the defendant's objection, the Commonwealth could have recalled the detective or called another witness to testify about the distance between 1380 Main Street and the nearby school."", 'See Commonwealth v. Shine,', "", 656 (1986) (prosecution permitted to reopen case and recall witness to introduce material evidence). The judge's time-saving decision to allow the detective's testimony during redirect examination did not constitute an abuse of discretion."", '6. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgments on the indictments charging the defendant with trafficking in cocaine and possession of marijuana and set aside the findings of guilty on those indictments. We affirm the remaining judgments.', 'So ordered.']"

The teacher relayed that information, and the description provided by the student, to a Brockton police officer stationed inside the high school. With the assistance of two school employees, the officer and his superior located the defendant inside the high school.

Defense counsel stated also that the defendant would waive his right to trial by jury. According to defense counsel, the defendant wanted to proceed in that manner, rather than plead guilty, so that he could appeal the denial of the motion to suppress. The judge conducted a jury waiver colloquy and warned the defendant of the potential immigration consequences of a conviction. The trial consisted solely of admission of the police report in evidence and the stipulation that the firearm worked. The judge imposed concurrent one-year sentences on each of the firearm charges.', 'Page 282', 'Discussion. 1. Motion to suppress firearm. The motion judge found the following facts.

Harrington had served at the high school for approximately thirty years. He knew the student from contact on a daily basis. The student told Harrington that he had seen a fellow student with a gun inside the high school. He said that the student\'s name began with an ""M"" and that he was a Cape Verdean male of about seventeen years of age with braided hair. He reported also that the student was dressed in a red and black striped shirt and blue jeans.', 'Harrington relayed the information to Brockton police Officer David Vaughn on duty inside the high school. Officer Vaughn had been stationed at the high school for four years and was familiar with Harrington. That officer shared the information with his superior also on duty at the high school. The officers walked through the high school and looked unsuccessfully for a person fitting the description. At approximately 12:30 P.M., they went to the assistant housemaster of the red school (an apparent subdivision of the high school physical plant and population) to report the information. The officers relayed the description of the student to the assistant housemaster and to a teacher in the assistant housemaster\'s office. After they heard the description of the student, both the assistant housemaster and the teacher said that it sounded like the defendant, whom they referred to as ""Manny Monteiro."" They told the officers that the defendant was in the cafeteria.

Commonwealth v. Costa,', ', 514 (2007), quoting from Commonwealth v. Lyons,', ', 18-19 (1990).

Ibid.', ""The defendant argues that the student informant did not have a sufficient basis of knowledge to provide the officers with a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed or was committing a crime. The officers' stop and frisk of the defendant was an investigatory stop which required the support of reasonable suspicion. See Commonwealth v. Costa, supra at 514 (under Federal and State Constitutions, investigatory stops must have support of reasonable suspicion). Although the stop and frisk occurred inside a school, the less stringent standard applicable to"", 'Page 284', 'searches within schools performed by school officials does not govern here, because a police officer performed the search. See New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 340-341 & n.7 (1985) (warrant requirement ""unsuited to the school environment,"" and reasonableness under totality of circumstances, rather than probable cause, justifies warrantless searches by school officials not acting as agents of law enforcement); Commonwealth v.

Smith, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 175 , 181-182 (2008) (school official\'s warrantless search of student\'s belongings justified by reasonable suspicion). Therefore, the question is whether the information supplied by the student to Harrington, and then relayed by Harrington to the officer, provided reasonable suspicion to justify the patfrisk of the defendant. To answer that question we must consider the basis of the student\'s knowledge.', 'See Commonwealth v. Lyons, 409 Mass. at 19.', 'The student informant based his report on his own observations. The judge found that the student told Harrington that he had seen another student with a gun. The student gave a detailed description of the appearance of the student with the gun, including his hairstyle, his clothes of the day, and the first letter of his nickname. Of the 200 to 300 students whom the officers observed in the cafeteria, only the defendant fit that description. We conclude that the student informant had a sufficient basis of knowledge to supply the officers with a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had possession of a firearm inside of the high school. Compare', 'Page 285', 'Commonwealth v. Alfonso A.,', ', 374 (2003) (informant had sufficient basis of knowledge from his observations, and amount of detail he provided was ""consistent with personal observation, not mere recitation of a casual rumor""). Although the student informant\'s knowledge resulted solely from his observation of the firearm earlier that day, that observation was enough to support a reasonable suspicion that the defendant possessed a firearm. See Commonwealth v. Montanez,', ', 300 (1991) (basis of knowledge requirement satisfied because ""informants\' knowledge was based on personal observations""); Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 668 (2000) (""It is well established that an informant\'s basis of knowledge may be satisfied simply by his or her personal observation of drugs in the place sought to be searched . . .""). In this instance, a direct observation provided a very specific description.', ""The transmittal of the student informant's report through Harrington to the officer does not negate its reliability. The officer knew Harrington; Harrington had taught at the high school for thirty years. His basis of knowledge depended entirely on that of the student. Because the student's report was reliable, and Harrington's credibility well established, his relay of that report to the officer was reliable also."", 'In these circumstances, a reasonable suspicion that the defendant possessed a firearm at the high school was equivalent to a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was committing a crime. The defendant was seventeen at the time of these events. He was not old enough to be in licensed possession of a firearm. See G. L. c. 140, § 131(d)(iv). Furthermore, even a person licensed to carry a firearm could not have possessed a firearm lawfully inside the high school without the permission of school authorities. See G. L. c. 269, § 10(j). Therefore, we conclude that the stop of the defendant had the support of reasonable suspicion and that the motion judge properly denied the motion to suppress the firearm.', 'The nature of the suspected crime and its location abundantly supported the frisk. They indicated the presence of a firearm in a public high school at which the attendance of students is mandatory, concentrated, and vulnerable. The circumstances required the protection of the police, students, faculty, and administrators', 'Page 286', 'from danger. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968); Commonwealth v. Almeida,', ', 271 (1977).', '', '2. Trial on stipulated evidence. On the day of trial, the judge asked the prosecutor whether the Commonwealth\'s evidence would consist solely of the police report. The prosecutor told the judge that he intended to submit the case ""on the police report."" Defense counsel informed the judge that the defendant would stipulate that the firearm was operational. In addition, he informed the judge that the defendant intended to waive his right to trial by jury. To explain the stipulations and waiver of jury trial, defense counsel said: ""[The defendant] has read the police report . . . which contains the relevant facts concerning this particular incident. He\'s willing to stipulate that those would be the facts that you would hear at a jury waived trial. The purpose of this is to conduct a jury waive[d] trial so in the event that [the defendant] . . . wants to appeal [the motion judge\'s] decision on the motion to suppress later on . . . he would do so."" Defense counsel stated further that the defendant ""realize[d] that there [were] sufficient facts"" to support convictions on the firearm charges, and that he would ""receiv[e] the year minimum mandatory"" sentence. Finally, defense counsel stated, ""I just want the court and the record to be clear that I did speak to [the defendant] about his rights to a jury trial. He knows those rights . . . . He further understands that by doing it this way, he\'s still preserving his appellate right.""', 'The prosecutor then asked the judge to conduct a jury waiver colloquy ""to make sure that it\'s on the record that [the defendant] is apprised of all [of his] rights."" Before the judge conducted a colloquy, though, he heard the parties\' arguments on sentencing. The prosecutor argued for two and one-half years of incarceration. Defense counsel requested one year of confinement on the unlicensed possession charge, a ""guilty file"" on the other firearm charge, and a finding of not guilty on the receipt of stolen property charge. He stated that the defendant was ""standing . . . in front of [the judge] essentially admitting to [the', 'Page 287', 'charges]. . . . [H]e\'s throwing himself on the mercy of the court realizing his judgment . . . was absolutely less than perfect and lacked all kinds of . . . reason."" In response to counsel\'s arguments, the judge stated that he would impose the mandatory minimum sentence of one year.', 'The judge then conducted a jury waiver colloquy, and the defendant asserted that he understood his rights. In regard to the stipulated evidence, the judge asked the defendant whether he understood that the judge would not hear ""the evidence in the usual forum where there\'s testimony given and direct examination by the prosecution and presentation of the evidence and cross-examination by your lawyer."" He reminded the defendant that the prosecution ""submitted a police report as being the facts in the case,"" and warned him that ""I make the judgment from the police report."" The defendant\'s reply indicated that he understood the proposed procedure. The judge then asked the defendant whether he understood that a conviction could result in deportation and other immigration consequences, and the defendant stated that he understood. Finally, the judge asked whether the defendant still wished to proceed in the proposed manner despite the stated risks. The defendant responded affirmatively.', ""At the judge's request, the prosecutor moved for trial. The judge admitted the police report in evidence without any objection from defense counsel, and the parties stipulated that the handgun was a working firearm. Both parties then rested, and the judge found the defendant guilty of the firearm charges and not guilty of receipt of stolen property. The judge sentenced the defendant as promised."", '', 'The defendant argues that the colloquy conducted by the trial judge failed to warn him adequately of the rights waived by trial on stipulated evidence. We addressed this issue in Commonwealth v. Castillo,', ', 37 (2006): ""A trial based on stipulated evidence is not \'a trial constitutionally capable of supporting a conviction,\' Commonwealth v. Brady,', ', 788 (2003), unless it appears on the record that there is an inquiry whether the defendant understands the significance of such a trial as opposed to a customary trial,', 'Page 288', 'see Commonwealth v. Stevens,', ', 776 (1980); that the defendant is informed of the rights the defendant has surrendered, including the right to confrontation, the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to testify, among others; and that the defendant freely, knowingly and voluntarily waives those rights. Commonwealth v. Babcock, 25 Mass. App. Ct. [688,] 691-692 [1988]. Commonwealth v. Brady, 59 Mass. App. Ct. at 787-788."" We remain convinced that such an inquiry serves both the fairness and the accuracy of the result. We examine the present events to determine whether the trial judge informed the defendant of the rights surrendered when he agreed to a trial on stipulated evidence, and whether the defendant intelligently and voluntarily waived those rights.', 'The trial judge warned the defendant that, under the chosen procedure, his lawyer would not present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. However, the warning did not specifically inform the defendant of his right to cross-examination or his right to call his own witnesses. It did not mention the right to confrontation or the right not to incriminate himself. See Commonwealth v. Babcock, 25 Mass. App. Ct. at 691-692. Consequently, the trial was not ""constitutionally capable of supporting a conviction."" Commonwealth v. Brady, 59 Mass. App. Ct. at 788. The inadequacy of the colloquy makes it unnecessary to consider whether the defendant freely, knowingly, and voluntarily waived those rights. He could not intelligently waive rights of which he remained unwarned. Our reasoning does not mean to slight the Commonwealth\'s argument that the defendant\'s agreement to the admission of the stipulated information (in lieu of a typical guilty plea) gave him the benefit of a chance to win the suppression issue on appeal. However, the case law against abbreviated colloquies for stipulated admission of decisive evidence is strong and prohibitive.', 'A defendant\'s proposal of a bench trial upon stipulated evidence may present a prospect of efficiency to trial judges burdened by heavy workloads. However, without the caution of a detailed but efficient colloquy itemizing the rights surrendered and confirming the intelligence and voluntariness of their relinquishment, the trial exposes a conviction to recantation and to subsequent proceedings far more onerous than the original administration of the warning. ""It invites appeals of the most hairsplitting sort and', 'Page 289', 'cannot be justified to save court time."" Commonwealth v. Babcock, 25 Mass. App. Ct. at 691. ""The trial judge should, without eliciting from the defendant a plea of guilty which the defendant is disinclined to offer, question the defendant whether he recognizes that 1) he is entitled to confront witnesses against him; 2) the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the offense beyond a reasonable doubt; 3) he may be giving up the right not to incriminate himself; 4) he is giving up the right to cross-examine; and 5) that he is acknowledging evidence likely to lead to a finding of guilty.""

To batten down the waiver, the itemized warning should serve as standard operating procedure for jury-waived trials upon stipulated evidence.', 'It assures fairness to the defendant and prevents wasteful posttrial motions and appeals of the kind predicted by the Babcock decision more than twenty years ago.', ""Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the motion judge properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress the firearm. It will be admissible at any subsequent retrial of the charges. We conclude also that the colloquy prior to the jury-waived trial on stipulated evidence did not adequately inform the defendant of the rights relinquished by his choice of that procedure. We reverse the judgments and remand the case to the District Court for a new trial or other proceedings consistent with this opinion."", 'So ordered.']"

The man was described as a black male wearing a gray shirt and yellow pants standing outside of a green Honda automobile. Officer Oliveira, who was traveling alone in his marked cruiser, was the first to arrive in the area. He observed a green Honda parked on Hazard Street. He got out of his cruiser and ordered the driver, the defendant, out of the car. The defendant got out of the car. He was a black male wearing a gray shirt and green pants. The officer conducted a pat frisk of the defendant and asked him whether he had any weapons. The defendant stated that a weapon was in the car.""', '', 'Waiver. First, the Commonwealth complains that the defendant has waived the argument he presents on appeal because, at the suppression hearing, the defendant did not specifically challenge the exit order or the veracity or reliability of the call to the police, contrary to the requirements of Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a)(2), as appearing in  442 Mass. 1516  (2004). We disagree.', ""The essence of the defendant's argument was that the search and seizure was not justified. In his affidavit, the defendant complained that the police removed him from his car, frisked him, and searched his car without consent. It is clear from a reading of the motion papers that the lawfulness of this warrantless search was being placed at issue. While neither the motion to suppress"", 'Page 793', ""nor the defendant's affidavit specifically challenged whether the officers had an adequate basis to conduct this stop and frisk, the Commonwealth had the burden to prove that the officer's intervention was lawful and based on reasonable suspicion. See Commonwealth v. Antobenedetto,"", ', 56-57 (1974); Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 212-213 (1991).

Commonwealth v. Berment,', ', 526 (1995), quoting from Commonwealth v. Cheek,', ', 494-495 (1992).', ""Moreover, the Commonwealth was on fair notice that the unidentified 911 call was the only basis on which the stop and exit order could be justified, because when the police arrived at the defendant's location, they observed the defendant, seated in a motor vehicle, without any suspicious activity taking place.

Edwards, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 716 , 719 (2008). Therefore, we conclude that the motion and affidavit sufficiently expressed the basis of the defendant's request to suppress all items seized as a result of the vehicle search, including any statements made to police, because the search and seizure violated his Federal and State constitutional rights."", ""Stop and frisk. Turning to the merits, the main issue on appeal is whether the Commonwealth established that the radio dispatch on which the police acted carried sufficient evidence of its reliability and basis of knowledge to satisfy constitutional requirements. Because the Commonwealth failed to establish the reliability of the report underpinning the officer's actions, the evidence must be suppressed. Put differently, the evidence must be suppressed, not because what the officer did was unreasonable based upon what was reported to him, but because the Commonwealth failed to establish the reliability of what was reported anonymously."", 'In determining whether an officer acts reasonably in initiating', 'Page 794', 'a threshold, or investigatory, stop, we view the circumstances as a whole, see Commonwealth v.

In addition, the caller reported her location. Here, no such information was available on which to conclude that the caller and his or her information warranted credit."", 'Also lacking is the independent police corroboration necessary to make up for deficiencies in the indicia of reliability of the call that formed the basis of the broadcast information. See Commonwealth v. Barros, 435 Mass. at 176-177.

See Florida v. J.L., supra at 272 (tip failed reliability test in its assertion of illegality); Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 117 , 120 (2008). Compare Commonwealth v. Fraser,', ', 546-547 (1991) (patfrisk justified where even with unverified tip, when police arrived at scene they were outnumbered, defendant bent ""down behind a truck in a manner suggesting that he might be picking something up or putting something down, and then [he] confronted the officer with his hands in his pockets""); Commonwealth v.

Dawson,', ', 467 (1987), the Commonwealth asserts that ""[p]roof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis and may be made by circumstantial evidence,"" claiming that witnesses testified that the substances were cocaine and heroin. Such testimony as we have discovered was given by police officers who testified to methods of packaging, price ranges, and use of paraphernalia such as scales, dilutents, and a narcotics press. While, on proper findings, a ""police or drug-user witness\'s experience with a drug would . . . permit him to give an opinion as to what drug a particular substance was,"" ibid.; here there were neither such findings nor opinions.', 'There were no field tests or', 'Page 70', 'other independent analysis of the substances.

In any event, ""it would be a rare case in which a witness\'s statement that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction."" Commonwealth v. Dawson, supra.', 'The Commonwealth also implies that the high sales price of the substances in this case is indicative that they were cocaine and heroin. However, given the availability of counterfeit drugs, see G. L. c. 94C, § 32G, selling prices would not be conclusive evidence of the nature of a substance.', '', 'There is no merit in the Commonwealth\'s assertion that ""evidence regarding the weight of the drugs was iron-clad,"" because the informant specifically ordered 300 grams of cocaine and 200 grams of heroin, and those quantities were found in the bag thrown from the car. Those weights, however, were established only by the certificates. The police did not independently weigh the substances, nor did they provide any information from which the jury might reasonably calculate the total weights of the substances. Contrast Commonwealth v. Connolly, supra at 831-832. The Commonwealth mistakenly relies on authority in support of lay opinion as to weight,', 'for the notion that the jurors could determine the weight and nature of the drugs by examining them. It is highly unlikely that a lay person unfamiliar with the metric system would be able to determine weights, particularly to the accuracy required in borderline cases. For example, in this', 'Page 71', 'case one item of heroin weighed, according to the certificates, 105.97 grams,', 'and one item of cocaine weighed 201.61 grams,', 'both very close to the statutory minima of 100 and 200 grams, respectively.

The prosecutor did not argue that there was any independent or corroborating evidence of either the composition or the weights of the substances.', '', 'Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that the error in admitting the certificates was not important to the outcome of the trial because the defendant did not challenge the composition or the weight of the cocaine and heroin, and premised his defense on the lack of visual evidence connecting him with the drugs, as well as questioning the credibility of the informant; a defense not calling into question the certificates.', 'In certain cases the failure to contest a particular element of a crime is ""important to a determination whether a trial error resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.""

The judge also informed the defendant that he would be able to receive assistance from standby counsel should he wish.', 'Finally, the defendant appeared for trial before a third judge. Counsel (identifying herself to the court as standby counsel) informed the judge that the defendant had ""[t]his morning . . . opted to waive counsel."" The trial judge asked the defendant whether the second judge had conducted a ""conversation with you about representing yourself,"" and was told that he had. The defendant volunteered that he had also had a conversation with the first judge about waiving counsel. The trial judge inquired whether the defendant had represented himself before, and the defendant replied that he had and that he had ""won cases.""', 'The defendant then stated that he had ""a couple of conditions [based upon] which [he] wanted to file a [m]otion to [d]ismiss,"" that he had recently had a ""grand mal seizure,"" and that he suffered from an ""impulsive condition which is neurologically documented."" The trial judge did not inquire into these statements, but instead next asked whether the defendant knew the charge against him (the defendant accurately identified the charge as assault and battery), and whether he knew the elements of the crime charged (the defendant replied that he did). The defendant', 'Page 274', 'reaffirmed that he wished to proceed pro se, and the following exchange then took place:', 'THE COURT: ""And you\'ve talked to [the second judge] about this as well, is that correct?""', 'THE DEFENDANT: ""Yeah. He gave me a little talking to.""', 'THE COURT: ""Okay, good. All right. Well, then you can be seated. . . .""', '', 'The defendant never signed a written waiver of counsel. The defendant represented himself at trial, with the assistance of standby counsel.', '2. Discussion. The defendant argues that his right to trial before a jury was not effectively waived because the requirements of G. L. c. 218, § 26A, were not satisfied, and the colloquy was inadequate. The defendant also argues that his counsel waiver was defective because he did not execute or file a written waiver, and the colloquy was inadequate. We agree with the defendant that the failure to satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 218, § 26A, requires that his conviction be reversed.', 'a. General Laws c. 218, § 26A. Section 26A of c. 218 provides a right to a jury of six in criminal cases tried in the Boston Municipal Court and the District Court Department. That right may be waived in writing,', 'provided certain requirements are satisfied. Among other things,', '', '. . . . Such waiver shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of [G. L. c. 263, § 6]; provided, however, that defense counsel shall execute a certificate signed by said counsel indicating that he has made all the', 'Page 275', 'necessary explanations and determinations regarding such waiver."" (Emphasis added.)', ""G. L. c. 218, § 26A, as appearing in St. 1992, c. 379, § 139.\n\n        Here, at the time the defendant's jury waiver was purportedly received, the defendant was not represented by counsel but was instead proceeding pro se, assisted by standby counsel. No written waiver of counsel had been signed or filed. Thus, the plain terms of § 26A emphasized above were not satisfied."", ""The Commonwealth argues that the statute was sufficiently honored in the circumstances of this case by virtue of standby counsel's certification that she explained to the defendant the consequences of his jury waiver and by her active assistance during trial. It is true that standby counsel played an active role during trial, assisting the defendant in seeking to have evidence admitted and arguing on his behalf during sentencing. It is also true that she signed the certification contained on the jury waiver form. We are loath, however, to substitute a case-specific evaluation of a particular standby counsel's activities for the plain language of the statute, which forbids the receipt of a jury waiver unless the defendant is represented by counsel or has previously filed a written waiver of counsel. See Sullivan v. Brookline,"", ', 360 (2001) (""statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result""); Commissioner of Correction v. Superior Ct. Dept. of the Trial Ct. for the County of Worcester,', ', 124 (2006) (where language is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent). See also Commonwealth v.

Standby counsel is available only to assist the defendant to the extent, and in the manner, the defendant wishes to call upon such counsel while representing himself. Standby counsel does not formally represent the defendant. Nor does standby"", 'Page 276', ""counsel protect the defendant's interests in the same way or to the same extent as counsel. See Commonwealth v. Conefrey,"", "", 13 (1991) (requirement that any cross-examination of complainant be done by standby counsel, instead of defendant, violated defendant's right of self-representation); Commonwealth v. Molino,"", ', 152-154 (1991) (pro se defendant has no constitutional right to assistance from standby counsel; appointment and reasonable limitations on standby counsel\'s participation are left to broad discretion of trial judge); S.J.C. Rule 3:10, § 6, as amended,  416 Mass. 1306  (1993) (""Notwithstanding a party\'s waiver of counsel, the judge may assign counsel . . . to be available to', 'the party in the course of the proceedings"" [emphasis added]). That the defendant received assistance from standby counsel does not change the basic fact that standby counsel did not represent the defendant.', 'Because the defendant was not represented by counsel at the time his jury waiver was received (standby counsel being no substitute), and because he had not previously filed a written waiver of counsel, his jury waiver was ineffective for failure to satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 218, § 26A. We must therefore reverse his conviction resulting from the bench trial.', ""b. Remaining arguments. Although we do not rest our decision on these grounds, we comment briefly on the defendant's remaining arguments, specifically: that neither the jury waiver colloquy nor the counsel waiver colloquy was adequate, and that he did not effectively waive counsel because no written waiver was secured, contrary to the requirements of Mass.R.Crim.P. 8, as amended,  397 Mass. 1226  (1986),"", 'and S.J.C. Rule 3:10.', '', 'We acknowledge and are sympathetic to the fact that in our busy trial courts, case management constraints require at times that defendants appear before multiple judges. In this case, however,', 'Page 277', 'several unintended consequences appear to have resulted from the fact that no single judge oversaw the defendant\'s waivers and that each judge relied on the others for the necessary inquiry into the defendant\'s state of mind. Among these, no written counsel waiver was obtained, contrary to the mandate of S.J.C. Rule 3:10. See Commonwealth v. Mullen, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 136 , 142 n.2 (2008) (""Judicial compliance with rule 3:10 is mandatory""). The absence of a written counsel waiver does not alone require reversal, provided there is sufficient other evidence in the record to demonstrate that the waiver was voluntary and intelligent. See Commonwealth v. Pamplona,', ', 242-243 (2003). Contrast Commonwealth v. Osborne, 445 Mass. at 781 (absence of written jury waiver mandates reversal). Here, however, the absence of a written counsel waiver is indicative of the incomplete nature of the truncated interactions the defendant had with three different judges concerning the waivers of his constitutional rights.', ""Additionally, despite the defendant's disclosures, no judge inquired into the effect, if any, his alleged medical conditions may have had on his ability to make rational decisions consistent with self-representation or with waiving his right to a jury."", 'See Commonwealth v.

By way of further example, no judge inquired into whether the defendant had been induced, coerced, or cajoled into relinquishing his rights, or whether he was intoxicated or otherwise mentally impaired. See Ciummei v. Commonwealth,', ', 510 (1979) (among other things, court should ensure that the defendant ""has not been pressured or cajoled and is not intoxicated or otherwise rendered incapable of rational judgment"").', ""When a defendant has appeared before multiple judges for various pretrial proceedings, the trial judge should be particularly cautious about relying on prior inquiries into the defendant's state of mind concerning the waiver of constitutional rights"", 'Page 278', 'such as the right to counsel and to a jury.

We affirm."", 'Background. We summarize the facts as the jury could have found them, reserving certain details for discussion of the issues.', 'Four people testified for the Commonwealth: Trooper Fred', 'Page 866', 'Geiger of the Massachusetts State police; Officer Robert Lockett of the Chicopee police department', '; Special Agent Christopher Dillon of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and Charles Smith, an informant who participated in two controlled buys from the defendant. Geiger first met Smith in February, 2006.', 'Smith told Geiger that he had information about drug dealing and expressed his willingness to make controlled buys. He named several drug dealers, including the defendant, and while Smith worked with law enforcement on several cases, the defendant was one of the persons they first targeted.', ""On February 16, 2006, at the FBI office in the presence of Geiger, Smith called the defendant to arrange a purchase of cocaine for the next day. On February 17, Smith again met the officers at the FBI office; Smith called the defendant and established a meeting at 55 Dearborn Street in Springfield. Geiger searched Smith's person and car, including those areas where a one-quarter ounce bag of cocaine (such as that later marked as an exhibit) could be secreted, to ensure that Smith was not in possession of money, weapons, or narcotics. Smith was outfitted with a covert audio and video recorder, which provided a live audio feed for Smith's safety. The agents activated the equipment and provided Smith with $275 in buy money."", 'Smith and Geiger drove to Dearborn Street separately, with Geiger following Smith.', ""Geiger was aware that Smith's car had been having problems, and several times during the drive, Smith stopped the car and checked under the hood. Geiger testified that he could not see what Smith did while he was under the hood."", 'When Smith arrived at Dearborn Street, he called the defendant and was told to pull into the driveway, which is where the two met. During the minute or two that the defendant and Smith were together, Geiger could see the defendant in person. The video showed the defendant reach into his pocket and then, later,', 'Page 867', 'hold currency in his hand. However, the video did not show the exchange of drugs for money that Smith described in his testimony. Smith drove directly back to the FBI office with Geiger following. Geiger had maintained visual contact with Smith the entire time the video equipment was taping. Smith explained what had transpired and gave the substance he purchased from the defendant to Geiger. Geiger again searched Smith and his car and found nothing of consequence.', 'Geiger and Smith next met on February 28, 2006, to set up the second controlled buy. They followed the same procedures as the first occasion, with the exception that this time Smith was directed to purchase a certain amount of cocaine and given a digital scale. Smith was told to inform the defendant that he wanted to weigh the drugs because he had been ""shorted"" the first time. Geiger again followed Smith and kept him under surveillance to the prearranged location, Smokin\' Deals, a store in Springfield. Geiger was also in contact with Smith by cellular telephone. Geiger saw Smith arrive at the location and saw the defendant and Smith together in a car for less than a minute. Geiger continued to observe Smith as he drove back to the FBI office. Once back at the office, the same debriefing and search procedures as before were followed. Again, the search of Smith and his car turned up nothing of consequence.', 'After each controlled buy, Geiger field tested the substances obtained from the defendant, then sent them to a lab for analysis. Both the field tests and laboratory analyses indicated the substances were cocaine.', 'Discussion. Vouching.

Commonwealth v. Kebreau,', ', 304 (2009).', 'In particular, the defendant\'s claim is based on the testimony of Trooper Geiger and Special Agent Dillon describing the process necessary for Smith to become a government informant and participate in controlled buys. Geiger testified that he introduced Smith to ""one of the controlling FBI agents,"" submitted', 'Page 868', 'information about Smith\'s criminal history to the FBI, consulted with the United States Attorney\'s office, and tested Smith\'s veracity. Geiger indicated that as Smith ""pass[ed] a certain standard,"" he was given a code name and authorized to make controlled buys.

Further, while details regarding the approval process were subject to exclusion upon relevance grounds, see Mass. G.

The unmistakable tenor of Geiger and Dillon\'s testimony about this ""verification"" was that Smith would not have been permitted to participate in controlled buys, handling drugs and money, without it.', ""Furthermore, admitting hearsay evidence of Smith's past relationship with the police does not make the Geiger and Dillon testimony improper.

On September 1, 2005, Trooper Steven Racki secured a warrant to search that apartment, and he and Trooper Scott Holland took positions near the apartment in anticipation of executing the warrant. At approximately 2:30 P.M., the defendant and a female were observed leaving the apartment while carrying several bags. They entered an automobile and drove away. Trooper Fallon, who was in a marked State police cruiser, stopped the defendant\'s car about one and one-half blocks later. Trooper Holland positioned his unmarked vehicle behind Trooper Fallon\'s cruiser, and as Holland approached the car, the defendant was exiting at Fallon\'s direction and Fallon stated that he ""smelled weed in the car."" Trooper Holland, an experienced narcotics officer trained in the identification of marijuana by sight and smell, walked to the driver\'s window and detected an odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the car\'s interior. Opening the door, he observed marijuana roaches in the ashtray and, in the center console, a clear plastic bag containing marijuana. A further search of the car revealed a leather bag behind the driver\'s seat, in which were found clear plastic bags with a ""white rock powder"" that Trooper Holland believed to be cocaine. The defendant was transported to the police station for booking and the troopers returned to the apartment to execute the warrant, discovering narcotics, hypodermic needles, cash, personal papers, and other items.', 'Discussion. 1.

Commonwealth v. Stephens,', ', 381 (2008).', 'a. The search of the defendant\'s apartment. The defendant argues that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. ""To establish probable cause to search, the facts contained in an affidavit, and reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them, must be sufficient for the magistrate to conclude \'that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they reasonably may be expected to be located in the place to be searched at the time the search warrant issues.\' "" Commonwealth v. Lopes,', ', 164-165 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. Anthony,', ', 68 (2008).', 'Page 273', 'The sufficiency of a search warrant application to establish probable cause is judged solely within the four corners of the affidavit. See Commonwealth v. Connolly,', "", 813 (2009). In assessing the contribution of a confidential informant's tips to the probable cause analysis, we employ the familiar tests of the informant's veracity and basis of knowledge. See Commonwealth v. Upton,"", ', 374-375 (1985). We briefly summarize pertinent facts as set forth in the affidavit.', 'In January, 2005, Trooper Racki spoke with a confidential informant he referred to by the pseudonym ""Mary."" She had provided information to police in the past that led to an arrest and seizure of drugs; most recently, three months prior to the affidavit. Mary stated that she knew of an individual named ""Freddy Velez"" who sold cocaine and marijuana. She provided a detailed physical description, offered his address and cellular telephone number, and stated that he sold drugs from his apartment and also made deliveries. Police investigation confirmed the defendant\'s name, description, residency at the given address, and use of the given telephone number. During the month preceding the defendant\'s arrest, Mary, under police supervision, made three controlled purchases of cocaine at the defendant\'s apartment. The third buy occurred within seventy-two hours of the application for the search warrant, which Trooper Racki submitted on the same day as the defendant\'s arrest.', ""We conclude that, in this case, Mary's veracity was established by the fact that she had previously given information which led to at least one arrest and seizure of contraband. See Commonwealth v. Perez-Baez,"", ', 46 (1991), and cases cited. Any weakness in her veracity, or in her basis of knowledge -- if the latter was not fully established by her statements that the defendant had drugs in his apartment at a certain address and used a certain telephone number, and sold $50 quantities of cocaine in small glassine bags -- was cured by the corroborative effect of the three controlled buys at that location. See Commonwealth v. Blake,', ', 828-829 (1992).', 'The controlled buys in this case followed the familiar protocol recited in multiple cases. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Desper,', "", 168 (1994), and cases cited. The facts that the defendant's residence was located within a three-unit dwelling,"", 'Page 274', 'and that the police did not observe which unit the informant entered, do not render the search warrant invalid. See Commonwealth v. Warren,', ', 90 (1994) (""police [are] not required to risk disclosure of their surveillance by accompanying the informant"" to an apartment within a multi-unit dwelling). Additionally, the seventy-two-hour delay between the third controlled buy and the application for the search warrant is not troubling in these circumstances because the other information in the affidavit, including the two other buys, established a continuing pattern of conduct in a fixed location over a comparatively longer time frame. See Commonwealth v. Rice,', ', 590 (1999) (""Where conduct is shown to be continuing . . . the passage of time becomes less important and staleness may be overcome""). The descriptions of the three buys, which all occurred at the residence that was the target of the search warrant, as well as the information provided by Mary, furnished probable cause to issue the search warrant for the defendant\'s apartment.', 'b. The stop and arrest of the defendant. The defendant correctly asserts that the search warrant itself did not give the troopers authority to seize him one and one-half blocks from his apartment. See Commonwealth v. Charros,', ', 764 (2005). However, at the time the car was stopped, the troopers were aware of the three controlled buys. Furthermore, they knew that these buys occurred during the month preceding the September 1, 2005, stop of the car, with the most recent within seventy-two hours of the stop. Accordingly, they had probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a felony as proscribed by G. L. c. 94C, § 32E(b), and thus both the initial stop and subsequent warrantless arrest were valid. See Commonwealth v. Charros, 443 Mass. at 764-765 (controlled buy made under police supervision within past fifteen days provided a basis for arrest, independent of recently issued search warrant).', 'c. The warrantless search of the defendant\'s car. Although the troopers did not have a warrant to search the car, under ""the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, the search of the [car] was justified as long as the [troopers] had probable cause to believe that there was contraband in the car."" Commonwealth v. Garden,', ', 47 (2008). At the motion hearing, Trooper Holland testified that he was trained in the', 'Page 275', ""identification of marijuana, including its appearance and odor, that he had smelled burnt marijuana in the past, and that when he approached the driver's window, he detected an odor of burnt marijuana."", 'This alone furnished probable cause to believe that there was marijuana in the car and thus its search was justified.', 'Id. at 48 (""the odor of marijuana is sufficiently distinctive that it alone can supply probable cause to believe that marijuana is nearby"").', '', ""In sum, the three controlled buys detailed in the affidavit supplied probable cause for the search warrant; the stop and arrest was supported by probable cause to believe the defendant had engaged in cocaine distribution; and the search of the car was proper under the automobile exception. Thus, the motion judge properly denied the defendant's motions to suppress evidence."", '2. Confidential informant. The defendant argues that the identity of the informant should have been disclosed. Here, Mary did not participate in any of the charged crimes and she was not present during the execution of the search warrant, the', 'Page 276', ""seizure of the items from the defendant's apartment, or the defendant's arrest. She acted only as a tipster, not as an active participant in the crimes charged, and thus disclosure of her identity was not required. See Commonwealth v. Brzezinski,"", ', 408 (1989) (government not required to disclose identity of informant who is mere tipster and not active participant in charged offense); Commonwealth v. Fernandes,', "", 339 (1991) (disclosure not required when informant did not participate in crime charged, even though he had participated in controlled buy within seven days of application for search warrant); Mass. G. Evid. § 509(a) (2010 ed.). Additionally, the Commonwealth's privilege applies even if the defendant knows Mary's true identity. See Commonwealth v. Madigan,"", "", 711 (2007). In balancing the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the informant against the defendant's right to prepare his defense, disclosure was not required in this case. See Commonwealth v. Lugo,"", ', 570-572 (1990).', '', '3. Ineffective assistance. The defendant argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the relaxation, intentional or otherwise, of the adversary process. The record reflects that defense counsel in effect pursued a strategy of ""jury nullification"" (despite that this was a bench trial), conceded liability for some of the crimes charged, and used the trial in an extended effort to seek leniency in sentencing.', '', 'Page 277', 'Although we normally review claims of ineffective assistance under the familiar principles of Commonwealth v. Saferian,', ', 96 (1974), the defendant seeks to bring his claim within dicta from United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), in which the United States Supreme Court identified three classes of ineffectiveness in which no showing of prejudice is required: a presumption of prejudice arises when there is (1) a ""complete denial of counsel . . . at a critical stage of [the] trial""; (2) ""if counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\'s case to meaningful adversarial testing""; and (3) where, ""although counsel is available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate.""', 'Id. at 659- 660. See Commonwealth v. Satterfield,', ', 115 (1977) (acknowledging there are some circumstances where a showing of prejudice is not required).', 'The Supreme Court has emphasized that the second category, which establishes prejudice per se when defense counsel fails to subject the prosecution\'s case to meaningful adversary testing, applies only when the attorney\'s failure to test the government\'s case is ""complete."" Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 697 (2002). While Massachusetts has not had the opportunity to apply these principles to circumstances such as those presented here, courts in other jurisdictions have held that unauthorized concessions of guilt can constitute a lack of adversary testing within the meaning of United States v. Cronic, supra.', '', ""We conclude that while some of defense counsel's remarks"", 'Page 278', ""were improper, there was not a complete lack of adversary testing. Defense counsel competently argued, and preserved for our review, issues relating to the search of the defendant's apartment, his stop and arrest, and the search of his car. After the defendant's unsuccessful motions to suppress, the evidence against him was overwhelming and, against counsel's advice, he rejected a favorable plea deal. We note that conceding guilt to less serious offenses can be an appropriate litigation strategy, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Durakowski,"", ', 93 (2003), and in these circumstances, we do not discern a complete abandonment of the adversary process. Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to a presumption of prejudice.', ""Nevertheless, we still assess the defendant's ineffective assistance claim under Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. at 96. Here, the trial judge repeatedly recognized the proper scope of his role as fact finder, and he indicated that the attorney's behavior did not influence him."", 'Even if the ""behavior of counsel [fell] measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,"" the defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was deprived ""of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence."" Ibid.', ""4. The judge's questioning. During trial, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from Andrew Bogle, a former drug chemist with the State police crime laboratory, regarding the weight and identity of certain substances that were admitted in evidence. During the Commonwealth's direct examination, the judge questioned the witness. The defendant argues that the judge's questions, which span approximately four transcript pages, impermissibly aided the Commonwealth in meeting its burden of proof. We disagree. The judge's questions, which simply clarified the representative sampling procedure the chemist"", 'Page 279', ""employed, were proper and did not alter the Commonwealth's burden. See Commonwealth v. Dias,"", ', 416 (1977) (""[A] judge may properly question a witness, even where to do so may strengthen the Commonwealth\'s case, so long as the examination is not partisan in nature, biased, or a display of belief in the defendant\'s guilt""); Commonwealth v. Hassey,', ', 810 (1996) (""[A] trial judge may question witnesses to clarify the evidence"").', ""5. Cumulative errors.

For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the denial of the defendant's motion to suppress."", '', '1. Background. On April 4, 2007, a Canton police detective telephoned the Brockton police regarding a housebreak in Canton.', ""The Canton detective informed the Brockton police that the defendant was the prime suspect in the housebreak, that an informant had told the Canton police that the defendant lived at 14 Benham Street in Brockton (where he reportedly had brought the stolen goods), and that he had two outstanding arrest warrants. One arrest warrant listed the defendant's address as 14 Benham Street, and the other listed a Rockland address."", 'The Brockton police arrested the defendant inside an apartment at the 14 Benham Street address. They had to use force to subdue the defendant, and, during the struggle, the defendant became bloodied and his shirt was torn off. After cleaning the defendant with a towel, the police asked him if he wanted a new shirt. The defendant said, ""yeah,"" and indicated in which bedroom a shirt could be found. While retrieving the shirt, the Brockton police spotted three plastic bags containing what appeared to be ""crack"" cocaine lying in an open dresser drawer. They charged the defendant with the drug offenses, and counsel was appointed.', 'Page 300', ""Inside the defendant's apartment, the Brockton police saw the goods allegedly stolen during the Canton housebreak. They froze the scene, and the Canton police obtained and executed a search warrant on the apartment. While the defendant remained in custody, but before he had been arraigned on the Canton housebreak, the Canton police came unannounced to interview him at the house of correction. Although the Canton police knew that the defendant had counsel for the drug charges, they did not notify that counsel or seek to secure counsel's permission to speak with the defendant. The defendant, however, was read his Miranda rights, and he signed a standard Miranda waiver form before the interview with the Canton police began."", 'The Canton police commenced their interview by questioning the defendant about his ties to the Brockton apartment (where both the drugs and stolen goods were found). The defendant initially denied ever living at the premises. When the Canton police confronted him with the fact that two named individuals had told them that the defendant lived there, the defendant interjected that one of the individuals ""was a scumbag and that after [the police] had left his residence, [that individual] had gone back in and stolen his dresser and the tv that had been left behind."" Realizing his error, the defendant went on to say ""that he knew he shouldn\'t have spoken with [the Canton police] and now he\'s hurt his other case."" The defendant then terminated the interview, and the Canton police never had the opportunity to ask him about the housebreak.', 'After holding an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\'s motion to suppress, a Superior Court judge concluded that the interrogation of the defendant at the house of correction was not ""a ruse to circumvent[] the Sixth Amendment"" and ""that the defendant\'s statement regarding ownership of the dresser where the drugs were secreted was a gratuitous comment, neither prompted by nor responsive to police questioning, and does not implicate Sixth Amendment concerns."" The motion judge also found that the defendant had consented to the interview after receiving Miranda warnings. The judge concluded: ""Considered in their totality, the circumstances surrounding the April 25, 2007 interview provide no basis for suppression under the Fifth or Sixth Amendments [to the United States Constitution] or Articles 12 or 14 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights]."" At trial,', 'Page 301', ""the Commonwealth introduced the defendant's statements as proof that the alleged drugs found in the dresser were his."", '2. Discussion. As noted above, the principal ground on which the motion judge relied was that the defendant\'s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not even implicated because the Canton police came to question the defendant about the Canton housebreak, not about the drug offenses. The defendant argues that this conclusion is erroneous, in essence, because the Canton police knew or should have known that their interrogation could easily lead him to make statements that would incriminate him on the drug charges. See United States v. Bender, 221 F.3d 265, 268 (1st Cir. 2000) (where it was obvious that questioning would lead to incriminating statements on pending charges, and those statements ""were deliberately elicited post-indictment, and were obtained in the absence of counsel . . . they were obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment and were rightly suppressed by the district court"").', ""We need not address the merits of the defendant's argument, because it is plain that the defendant waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before he spoke with the Canton police."", 'At the time of the motion judge\'s ruling, case law clearly established that, absent the consent of counsel, the police could not initiate an interrogation regarding a charge for which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached and been asserted, regardless of whether they had secured a valid Miranda waiver. See Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, 636 (1986) (""hold[ing] that, if police initiate interrogation after a defendant\'s assertion . . . of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendant\'s right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid""). However, in May, 2009, the United States Supreme Court effected a sea change in the law when it overruled Michigan v. Jackson. See Montejo v. Louisiana, 129 S. Ct.', 'Page 302', ""2079, 2091 (2009). Under Montejo, a valid Miranda waiver suffices to waive one's Sixth Amendment right to counsel."", 'Here, the defendant was read his Miranda rights, and he signed a standard Miranda waiver form.', ""We discern no error in the motion judge's conclusion that this was a valid Miranda waiver, and Montejo therefore compels us to conclude that the defendant waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when he agreed to speak with the Canton police."", ""We recognize that the defendant's waiver of his Sixth Amendment right does not mean that he also necessarily waived his parallel right under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights."", 'Although the defendant asserted his art. 12 right below, on appeal he relied entirely on the Sixth Amendment in arguing that his statements to the Canton police should have been suppressed, even though Montejo had been decided a month before his brief was filed. Moreover, despite the fact that the Commonwealth cited to Montejo in its opposition brief, the defendant did not file a reply brief seeking to raise art. 12 issues. We therefore conclude that the issue whether the defendant waived his art. 12 right to counsel, and the issue whether the questioning by the Canton police infringed upon that right, are not properly before us.', '3. Conclusion. For the reasons stated above and in the companion memorandum and order, Commonwealth v. Tlasek (No. 2), post 1111 (2010), the judgments on indictments 07-00359-001 and 07-00359-002, charging trafficking in a controlled substance,', 'Page 303', 'and trafficking in a controlled substance in a school zone, are reversed, and the verdicts are set aside.

He challenges the empanelment of a particular juror and the prosecutor's closing argument to the jury. We affirm."", 'Background. A Superior Court jury could have found the following facts. On December 1, 2006, at about 2:00 A.M., Clark University campus police officer Michael Palermo noticed a yellow car parked on a street corner in Worcester. Officer Palermo believed that the driver of the vehicle, defendant Antoine Ayoub, had been attempting to entice two female college students into his car. When the officer approached the vehicle, the defendant drove away. The women told him that the defendant had attempted to lure them into his car. Officer Palermo broadcasted a description of the defendant and his vehicle to other campus officers and began pursuit.', ""Upon receiving the broadcast, two other campus officers saw the defendant's car and followed it. Officer Palermo pulled the defendant over, and all three officers approached the vehicle. They confronted him about the encounter with the women and requested his license and registration. Although he resisted initially by indicating that he was a deputy sheriff or State police informant, the defendant eventually produced the requested documents."", ""However, the exchange between the defendant and the officers grew contentious, so the officers called for backup from the municipal police. Three Worcester officers arrived momentarily. Fearing that the defendant had been attempting to reach for a weapon in the center console, the police asked him to come out of the vehicle. The defendant refused, and the officers tried to extricate him forcibly. A Worcester officer partially entered the car through the driver's door and grappled with the"", 'Page 565', 'defendant as he attempted to start the car. Officer Palermo entered the car through a rear passenger window.', 'The defendant managed to restart the car and accelerated to a high speed with the two officers trapped inside. The car soon collided with an embankment and flipped onto its side, and the two officers inside the car suffered serious injuries. The car had struck a third officer in the knee as it started away.', ""The ensuing searches of the car, unchallenged on appeal, produced, among other items, a loaded .45 caliber semiautomatic pistol with an attached magazine for which the defendant's license was suspended; two additional magazines; and a silver pipe and separate piece of paper, both with cocaine residue. At trial all six of the officers involved in the encounter testified. The judge admitted in evidence the handgun and attached magazine; the two separate magazine clips of ammunition; and the pipe and paper. The defendant testified. The jury found him guilty of the charges arising from his physical confrontation with the police, his use of the automobile in that confrontation, possession of the firearm, and possession of controlled substances."", '', 'Analysis. The defendant challenges his convictions on two grounds. He argues first that the Superior Court judge empaneled a biased juror. He contends also that the prosecutor committed various improprieties in his closing argument.', 'I. Juror empanelment. The defendant asserts that the trial judge abused his discretion when he allowed an individual (juror 27) to sit after she had answered affirmatively (by raising her hand) the general question whether she would grant greater weight and credibility to the testimony of a police officer.', 'During the empanelment process, ""[a] judge is only required to \'determine whether jurors [could] set aside their own opinions, weigh the evidence (excluding matters not properly before them) and follow the instructions of the judge.\' "" Commonwealth v.', 'Page 566', 'Bryant,', ', 501 (2006), quoting from Commonwealth v. Leahy,', ', 495 (2005). ""A trial judge has broad discretion in determining the partiality of a prospective juror . . . [and] is in a much better position than an appellate court to evaluate a prospective juror\'s ability to be impartial . . . ."" Commonwealth v. Jaime J.,', ', 271-272 (2002). Accordingly, ""we give a trial judge\'s determination of impartiality great deference."" Commonwealth v. Ferguson,', ', 353 (1997).', 'During the examination of the prospective jurors, juror 27 and several other individuals answered affirmatively to the question whether they would afford greater weight and credibility to a police officer\'s testimony. Most of these individuals were subjected to individual voir dire and excused for demonstrating their inability to remain impartial. These voir dire examinations varied in content and duration depending on the individual\'s answers. In two instances, the judge excused individuals for stating that they could not be fair and impartial. The judge asked juror 27 whether, for any reason, she would be unable to listen to the evidence and be fair and impartial. She answered, ""No."" The judge then asked whether she had raised her hand to any venire question. She stated that she had but could not recall which one. The judge then asked her whether the question involved anything that would affect her impartiality in the case. She responded, ""No, not at all.""', 'In examining juror 27, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate her credibility. See id. at 352-353, quoting from Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1038 (1984) (""The determination of a juror\'s impartiality \'is essentially one of credibility and therefore largely one of demeanor\' ""). Based on his observation of her under voir dire questioning, the judge was entitled to accept her representation of impartiality. See Commonwealth v. Bryant, supra at 500.', 'A judge may accept a juror\'s representation of impartiality unless ""solid evidence of a distinct bias"" appears. Commonwealth v. Leahy,', ', 499 (2005), citing from United States v. Anguilo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1183 (1st Cir. 1990). The judge\'s determination of the prospective juror\'s neutrality will stand unless ""prejudice is manifest."" Commonwealth v. Clark,', ',', 'Page 567', ""630 (2006). That deference acknowledges the judge's firsthand observation. See Commonwealth v. Bryant, supra."", 'Furthermore, defense counsel, privy to juror 27\'s responses, chose not to challenge her for cause or use a peremptory challenge. We find that the judge conducted a sufficient examination of juror 27. Her membership in the jury did not result in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. It did not generate ""a serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had [an] error not been made."" Commonwealth v. Randolph,', ', 297 (2002), quoting from Commonwealth v. Azar,', ', 687 (2002).', 'II. Prosecutor\'s closing argument. The defendant argues also that the prosecutor ""injected his personal belief in the credibility of the witnesses, repeatedly suggested to the jury that the defendant had failed to provide evidence that would explain his innocence, speculated as to facts not in evidence, and suggested to the jury that it was their responsibility to convict the defendant."" ""We consider the challenged comments in light of the entire argument, the judge\'s instructions, and the evidence at trial."" Commonwealth v. Burns,', ', 679-680 & n.5 (2000).', 'During his closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the defendant had told a ""very wild unbelievable story about what happened"" and gave ""no explanation,"" ""very little explanation,"" or said ""almost nothing"" about his actions, and characterized the defendant\'s testimony as ""border[ing] on the ridiculous,"" ""very self-serving . . . very weak,"" and ""preposterous.""', '', ""We do not conclude, as the defendant proposes, that these statements amounted to improper personal comment on the defendant's credibility and suggested that the defendant had failed to prove his innocence. Rather, they constitute commentary on the weakness of the defendant's case. See Commonwealth v. Feroli,"", ', 409 (1990) (""A prosecutor is entitled to emphasize the strong points of the Commonwealth\'s case and the weaknesses of the defendant\'s case . . . .""); Commonwealth v. Bregoli,', ', 275 n.17 (2000) (finding that the prosecutor\'s comment that the defendant ""provided no explanation""', 'Page 568', ""for certain misconduct was proper reflection on the strength of the Commonwealth's case and the weakness of the defendant's case). Also, a prosecutor may argue that the defendant is not credible. Commonwealth v. Lucido,"", ', 943 (1984) (""Where the defendant has testified, reference to the defendant\'s credibility in final argument is entirely proper""). The prosecutor neither injected his personal opinion of the defendant\'s account of the events nor shifted the burden of proof onto the defendant. See Commonwealth v. Sherick,', ', 343-346 (1987). The judge took care to instruct the jurors that the burden of proof at trial rested solely with the Commonwealth and that the defendant shouldered no burden whatsoever to offer any evidence despite his decision to testify.', 'In reference to testimony of one of the officers, the prosecutor asked, ""Frankly how can you find anything else? You would be really reaching to find something else,"" and stated that his testimony was ""credible, and you had to believe it. It may not be easy to believe. Sometime[s] people\'s jobs are not easy, but that\'s okay. That\'s life. And we have to do our jobs."" The defendant did not object to these statements during the trial. The defendant now contends not only that these statements constituted improper burden shifting and commentary on the defendant\'s credibility but also that they caused the jury to feel a responsibility to believe the Commonwealth\'s witnesses.', 'As with the statements above, we do not find that the prosecutor wrongly shifted the Commonwealth\'s burden onto the defendant or that he commented unfairly on the quality of the defendant\'s testimony. Further, we are not persuaded that the prosecutor\'s reference to ""jobs"" led the jury to believe it was their responsibility to find the Commonwealth\'s witnesses credible. Instead, its effect was merely to acknowledge the jury\'s difficult task of deciding matters of credibility. Although the prosecutor encouraged the jury to find the officer\'s testimony credible, his statements did not have the effect of compelling that result. And his use of the word ""jobs"" did not approach the forbidden proposal that a verdict of guilty was a civic duty. See Commonwealth v. Degro,', "", 328-329 (2000). The judge's instructions neutralized any potential prejudicial impact because they made clear that matters of credibility lay exclusively within"", 'Page 569', 'the province of the jury. These unobjected-to statements did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See id. at 329. Neither separately nor collectively do the comments create ""a serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had [they] not been made."" Commonwealth v. Randolph,', ', 297 (2002), quoting from Commonwealth v. Azar, 435 Mass. at 687.', 'Finally, the prosecutor pondered aloud to the jury, ""What\'s he going to do with those women? Hard to say. Very very fortunate that [the officer] was there. Very very fortunate.""', 'These statements were imprudent. They invited speculation about offenses uncommitted and, of course, uncharged. In such circumstances, we inspect the record to consider ""(1) whether the defendant seasonably objected; (2) whether the error was limited to collateral issues or went to the heart of the case; (3) what specific or general instructions the judge gave the jury which may have mitigated the mistake; and (4) whether the error, in the circumstances, possibly made a difference in the jury\'s conclusions."" Commonwealth v. Kater,', ', 422-423 (2000), quoting from Commonwealth v. Kozec,', ', 518 (1987).', 'Defense counsel made a timely objection. The remark referred to a peripheral circumstance of the case, and certainly not to the heart of the charged offenses. The judge overruled the objection, but in final instructions reminded the jury that they must deliver a verdict ""solely from the evidence admitted in this case and not from suspicion or conjecture."" He specified that ""the closing arguments of counsel are not evidence."" Finally, the wayward remark did not create a reasonable possibility of a different verdict. The volume of inculpatory evidence, both testimonial and tangible, was overwhelming. The remark was not so inflammatory or suggestive as to ""arous[e] the passions or sympathies of the jury."" Commonwealth v. Vazquez,', ', 312 (2006). In light of the quantity and strength of the inculpatory evidence, the remark was not harmful under the specific criteria of the Kozec and Kater decisions. Under the more general test of prejudicial error, it had slight effect, if any, on the verdict. See Commonwealth v. Flebotte,', ',', 'Page 570', '353 (1994); Commonwealth v. Graham,', ', 288 (2000).', '', 'Judgments affirmed.', '', '(dissenting). The prosecutor\'s closing argument was way over-the-top. ""It is long past time for prosecutors to prepare their closing arguments carefully in order to avoid the possibility of reversals of convictions because of prosecutorial error."" Commonwealth v. O\'Brien,', ', 778 (1979). How many times does this court and the Supreme Judicial Court have to admonish prosecutors to prepare carefully closing arguments? See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Kelly,', ', 270-272 (1994); Commonwealth v. Loguidice,', ', 454-457 (1995); Commonwealth v. Silva-Santiago,', ', 807-808 (2009); Commonwealth v. McLeod,', ', 541 (1991), and cases cited. We have even suggested that if prosecutors are unsure as to what to include in a closing speech, they seek guidance from the trial judge as to whether their proposed remarks would be ""beyond permissible limits"" of proper argument or perhaps even ""sail[ing] unnecessarily close to the wind.""

Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 677-678 (1979), the evidence at trial was as follows: On March 26, 2003, armed with a search warrant,', ""Fall River police officers announced their presence and, after receiving no response, forced their way into the defendant's first-floor apartment at 162 McCloskey Street. Inside were three men and a pit bull terrier. Upon seeing the police, the defendant fled, carrying a pink box; some of its contents fell along the path of his flight. Among items subsequently retrieved were several vials of steroids, hypodermic needles, and a key. Police later used the key to open a safe in the defendant's apartment."", 'When the defendant was apprehended shortly after the chase, the pink box was next to him and contained $8,000 wrapped in a rubber band. Two golf-ball-sized plastic bags containing white', 'Page 729', 'powder believed to be cocaine were near the box. The police handcuffed the defendant and brought him to his apartment where he waived his Miranda rights.', 'When questioned, he told police that he did not have any money or contraband other than what was in the pink box. Police, however, found in his apartment an additional bag of white powder, $2,679, a spoon with a powder residue, baggies, and three rolled-up dollar bills.', 'Near the rear entrance through which the defendant had fled, police retrieved a small digital scale. The money, the three bags of white powder, the rolled-up dollar bills, the scale, the baggies, and the spoon with the residue were among the exhibits at trial and were sent to the jury.', '', 'After having been shown the bag of white powder found in the apartment, the defendant said, ""Oh I forgot about that cocaine. Besides, that\'s just personal use."" When asked what he was doing with two and one-half ounces of cocaine,', 'he told the officer that he smokes cocaine all the time, and that three ounces were ""no big deal to him."" According to the officer, the defendant pointed out that the police only found one-half of an ounce in his house and also stated that he was smoking cocaine when the police initially knocked on the door. The police officer in charge of the investigation (Paul Gauvin) indicated on cross-examination that he believed the defendant ""was a little high"" when apprehended.', 'Certificates of drug analysis were admitted in evidence showing that each of the three bags as well as the residue on the spoon were cocaine. According to the certificates, one of the two bags found with the defendant after his chase contained 27.79 grams of cocaine, the other bag contained 27.91 grams, and the bag found in the apartment contained 14.86 grams of cocaine (a total of 70.76 grams).', 'After a voir dire, a police officer with extensive experience in narcotics investigations testified that fourteen grams is one-half', 'Page 730', 'of one ounce and that twenty-eight grams is one ounce, that one ounce of cocaine would sell for between eight and twelve hundred dollars, and that one-half of one ounce would sell for between four to six hundred dollars. When asked whether the possession by a person of sixty-eight to seventy grams of cocaine was consistent with personal use or with distribution, his answer was distribution, and when asked whether that amount of cocaine and $10,000 in cash was consistent with personal use or with distribution, he stated it would be consistent with distribution.', '2. Melendez-Diaz issue. The United States Supreme Court\'s decision in Melendez-Diaz requires us to hold that the admission of the drug certificates was constitutional error. The certificates were within the ""core class of testimonial statements"" that trigger confrontation clause protections. Melendez-Diaz, supra at 2532, quoting from Crawford v.

Verde,', '(2005), and before Melendez-Diaz, the standard of review is whether the admission of the drug certificates at trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Vasquez,', ', 352 (2010). The standard is strict, and the question is whether', '""we can be satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the erroneously admitted certificates of analysis had little or no effect on the verdicts. . . . It is not enough for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that its other, properly admitted evidence was \'sufficient\' to convict the defendant . . . . Rather, to establish harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt, the Commonwealth must show that other properly admitted evidence of guilt is \'overwhelming.\' ""', 'Id. at 362, quoting from Commonwealth v.

The court answered the question in the affirmative adding:', '""The trial judge will first have to make a finding that any police or drug-user witness\'s experience with a drug would or would not permit him to give an opinion as to what drug a particular substance was. If the judge finds the witness qualified, the knowledge and competence of that witness, and his lack of training in chemical analysis, will bear on the weight to be given to his testimony. We suspect it would be a rare case in which a witness\'s statement that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction.""', 'Id. at 467. See Vasquez, supra at 365. The court in Dawson also noted that ""[t]he great weight of authority in this country permits, for example, an experienced user of a controlled substance to testify that a substance that he saw and used was a particular drug."" Dawson, supra.', 'In this case, the defendant was a user of drugs. Indeed, he admitted to the police that he was using cocaine at the time of their initial entry -- a statement buttressed by the police officer\'s testimony that the defendant was a little high when apprehended. The defendant stated that he smoked all the time, that he had forgotten ""about that cocaine"" in the apartment, that', 'Page 732', 'the cocaine was for his personal use, and that three ounces was not a big deal.', 'In these circumstances, where the defendant admitted to being a substantial user of cocaine, stated that he was using cocaine in his apartment at the time the police arrived, and when shown the drugs found in the apartment, acknowledged that he had forgotten that cocaine was there, we consider the evidence that the composition of the drugs in the apartment was cocaine was so powerful that the certificates had little or no effect on the verdicts. See Commonwealth v. Harris,', ', 707 & n.10 (2009) (error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where, among other evidence, defendant had signed statement admitting substance was cocaine). Equally strong, particularly in view of the defendant\'s statement that ""three ounces was no big deal,"" is the inference that the bags of white powder found near him after he was apprehended was the same substance.', ""The overwhelming evidence of narcotics, including the large sum of money, the scale, the baggies, the spoon with a powder residue, and the defendant's flight, together with the defendant's admission that he was using cocaine when the police entered, and his implicit, if not explicit, admission that the drugs were cocaine lead us to conclude that the admission of the drug certificates had little or no effect in proving the substances found were cocaine."", '', 'The evidence of the certificates as to the amount of cocaine, although a more difficult question, was also, in our view, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of trafficking in fourteen or more grams of cocaine. When asked what he was doing with two and one-half ounces of cocaine, the defendant did not deny the amount, but rather stated that because he smoked all the time, three ounces was no big deal. He took pains to point out that only one-half of an ounce (fourteen grams) was found in his apartment. That he knew the actual weight of the cocaine can be inferred from the scale in his apartment. The one-half of an ounce bag as well as the two golf-ball-sized bags were admitted', 'Page 733', 'in evidence and sent to the jury. The jurors could determine that the weight of the cocaine in the three bags exceeded fourteen grams (half an ounce).', 'See Commonwealth v. Connolly,', ', 831 (2009). While there was testimony that seventy grams was more indicative of distribution than of personal use, the jury rejected the weight of seventy grams stated in the certificates. The other evidence of distribution, including the large amount of cash, the scale, and the baggies was such that we consider the error in admitting the certificates as to weight had little or no effect on the verdict and hence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', '3. Motion for new trial. Subsequent to his convictions, the defendant brought a motion for a new trial (which was heard by the trial judge) on the ground that his counsel had been ineffective in failing to seek a hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). In support of his motion, he sought discovery and also a Franks hearing. He claims that the two controlled buys, which were essential to the validity of the warrant affidavit, never occurred.', 'Under Franks,', '""where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\'s request.""', 'Id. at 155-156. If perjury or reckless disregard is established by a preponderance of the evidence and the remaining content of the affidavit is insufficient to provide probable cause, the search warrant must be voided, and the evidence seized excluded. Id. at 156.', 'In Commonwealth v. Amral,', ', 522, 525 (1990), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a defendant, under a less stringent test than Franks, may be entitled to an in camera hearing to determine whether he or she must receive a Franks hearing. Amaral, supra at 525. The court held ""that the public interest in', 'Page 734', 'deterring police misconduct requires the trial judge to exercise his or her discretion to order an in camera hearing where the defendant by affidavit asserts facts which cast a reasonable doubt on the veracity of material representations made by the affiant concerning a confidential informant.""

The question before us is whether his inquiry went far enough. We hold that it did, that an additional hearing was not necessary, and that the judge's denial of a new trial was within his discretion."", ""We take the facts relevant to the new trial motion from the record and the judge's careful memorandum. The defendant, in conjunction with his motion for a new trial, moved for extensive discovery concerning the controlled buys, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30 (c)(4),  435 Mass. 1501  (2001), including: the date and times of the alleged controlled buys; identity of the confidential informant; amount of narcotics alleged to have been purchased; amount of money alleged to have been paid in the two controlled buys; serial numbers of the money alleged to have been used in the controlled buys; and results of chemical analyses conducted on the drugs alleged to have been purchased in the two controlled buys."", ""The defendant filed a supporting affidavit, not included in the record, which the judge stated averred: that the material contained in Officer Paul Gauvin's warrant affidavit setting forth the two controlled buys was false; that the defendant never sold drugs to anyone; and that, despite explicit requests, the Commonwealth never turned over to the defense the analyses from the alleged controlled drug buys, Gauvin's request for funds for the two buys or the reports, logs, or memoranda regarding the two alleged controlled buys."", 'Page 735', 'The judge noted appellate counsel\'s claim that the only information relevant to the controlled buys given to the defendant was a single document. The record shows that that document, entitled ""Fall River Police Department Evidence/Property Custody Document,"" was dated March 28, 2003, two days after the warrants were executed and was redacted in two places. The document states that, as a result of the controlled buys, an unspecified amount of cocaine and ""O.C."" pills were received by Gauvin. It named Justin DeMatos (the defendant) as the person from whom the drugs were received and stated they were found at the defendant\'s address.', ""After recounting the pretrial proceedings and emphasizing the defendant's repeated requests for discovery, the judge summarized:"", '""DeMatos, by affidavit, denied that any drug sale took place. During 2005 and 2006, the Fall River Police Department failed to supply any information or documentation of the use of buy monies allegedly used in the controlled buys. Despite being directly ordered by the court [a different motion judge not the trial and current motion judge] to disclose such information, if available, the Fall River Police Department failed to provide any information tracing the existence of an account for buy monies, the use by Gauvin of buy monies, or the transfer of buy monies to the informant for use in the controlled buys. The question, therefore, arises whether trial counsel, faced with discrepancies in the handling of drugs pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, § 47A,', 'together with a curious absence of records accounting for the buy monies involved in the controlled buys, should have, as a matter of effective representation, moved for a Franks or Amral hearing.""', 'Page 736', 'The judge did not directly answer the question in his memorandum, but pointed out that the Commonwealth\'s failure to provide documentation of the use of buy monies ""does not derive from the Commonwealth\'s assertion of a privilege based on protecting the informant\'s identity.""', 'He stated that the absence of documentation on the use of monies in the two controlled buys leads to the reasonable inference that no public moneys were transferred to the informant. The judge concluded that the defendant\'s affidavit, together with this inference and the discrepancies in following the requirements of G. L. 94C, § 47A, see note 12, supra, ""provides enough heft to make it worthy of further exploration."" He then ordered the Commonwealth ""[t]o supply the court and appellate counsel with all information regarding the narcotics alleged to have been purchased and the buy monies alleged to have been used in the two controlled purchases.""', 'In response to the court order, the Commonwealth submitted:', '""1. Memorandum from Sgt. Paul Gauvin, Fall River Police (1 page);', '""2. Fall River Police Evidence/Property Custody Document (1 page); and', '""3. Controlled Purchase Buy Money Ledger (redacted, 1 page).""', 'Gauvin\'s memorandum, addressed to an assistant district attorney, stated that he was enclosing ""the controlled buy log and the evidence custody document,"" and requested that they be sanitized. He also added that ""as discussed during the trial with [the prosecutor], both the defendant and his brother had some involvement in threatening and physically assaulting several people in Fall River, in an effort to uncover the informant.""', '', 'The Evidence/Property Custody Document was the document', 'Page 737', 'provided earlier, the only difference was that the portion that had previously been redacted now showed ""1 bag cocaine"" and ""4 OCS pills.""', 'Upon receipt of this material, the judge entered the following order:', '""Sergeant Paul Gauvin shall submit an affidavit addressing the authenticity of the \'buy money ledger\' previously submitted to the court and the content of his one page memorandum on controlled buys that was also submitted to the court.""', 'In response, Gauvin filed an affidavit stating that he participated in two controlled buys, that he obtained a certain sum of money for what is termed on the control buy log as ""controlled buy \'B\' "" which covered both buys, that his memorandum attested to his concerns regarding safety, that both the controlled buy log and the Evidence/Property Custody documents are kept in the normal course of business, that he filled out the latter accurately, that the discovery materials submitted constitute the entirety of the information regarding the narcotics alleged to have been purchased and the buy monies, and that at the time the documents were drafted the department did not have a ""controlled policy.""', 'A controlled buy policy was put in place on April 17, 2003.', 'Considering that he had ""authoriz[ed] discrete discovery and [had] examin[ed] the results of that discovery process,"" the judge entered an order denying the motion for a new trial. In his view, the defendant had failed to demonstrate that the motion to suppress would have been successful and hence failed to show that counsel was ineffective. See Commonwealth v. Cutts,', ', 830 (2005).', ""The defendant's main focus on appeal is that the judge erred"", 'Page 738', ""in failing to order a Franks hearing because the defendant had made a substantial showing that the Fall River police intentionally fabricated the account of the controlled buys alleged in the warrant affidavits. He lays stress on the following: that no document exists prior to the warrant affidavits suggesting that the defendant was involved in a controlled buy; while the controlled buy ledger which was not produced until after many requests and several court orders predates the affidavit, it makes no mention of the defendant; the copies of the money referenced in the controlled buy ledger do not exist; the drugs from the buy were not turned in to the evidence officer until two days after the execution of the warrant and one week after the buys allegedly took place; the drugs no longer exist; and there is no documentation supporting the claim that the defendant was threatening individuals in an attempt to learn the name of the informant and defendant's trial counsel never heard such a claim."", '', 'It is true that the matters listed required further inquiry and, indeed, so the judge determined. However, they did not require a Franks hearing or even an Amral hearing. In Commonwealth v. Alcantara,', ', 595 (2002), where statements of the affiant concerning the informant in the affidavit in support of the warrant appeared to be inconsistent with other warrant applications, the judge, after a hearing, found that the affiant was credible, the affiant\'s explanation for the apparent inconsistencies acceptable, and that the affidavit in support of the warrant application ""did not contain misrepresentations sufficient to \'cast a reasonable doubt on the veracity of material representations made by the affiant concerning a confidential informant.\' "" Ibid., quoting from Commonwealth v. Padilla,', ', 72 (1997). On appeal in Alcantara, the defendant argued that the failure of the judge to conduct an in camera Amral hearing in which the affiant was required to disclose the identity of the informant or informants was an abuse of discretion. Noting there was no showing of clear error', 'Page 739', ""in the judge's findings of fact, and that the challenge to the judge's decision was nothing more than an argument about the affiant's credibility, an area in which deference is given to the motion judge, we held that there was no abuse of discretion in the judge's acceptance of the affiant's explanation and that an Amral hearing was not needed."", 'In the present case, the prosecution supplied the judge with information that satisfied him that there were no misrepresentations. Despite the fact that withholding of information had been shown, there was no indication of intentional misrepresentation. Gauvin had been the primary prosecution witness at trial, and the judge had observed him and could assess his credibility. In his memorandum requiring additional discovery from the Commonwealth, the judge correctly pointed out that ""the presence of misstatements or omissions in record-keeping on the buy monies and drugs involved in the controlled buys adding up to negligence"" would not require either a Franks or Amral hearing. See Commonwealth v. Nine Hundred and Ninety-Two Dollars,', ', 767 (1981).', 'Implicit in his decision denying the motion for a new trial was a finding that Gauvin was credible, that the discrepancies and late production were most likely the product of negligence and that, in any event, there were no misrepresentations sufficient to ""cast a reasonable doubt on the veracity of material representations made by the affiant concerning a confidential informant."" Amral, supra at 522.', ""Although the judge did not hold a preliminary hearing, as the judge did in Alcantara, supra at 595, the motion judge here ordered additional discovery, examined the documents that had been provided, and required an additional affidavit from Gauvin in which he swore to the authenticity of the documents. In following this course, the judge did not abuse his discretion in accepting the documents as authenticated by Gauvin and, based on this material and his assessment of Gauvin's credibility during trial, in determining that an Amral hearing was not necessary."", 'Judgments affirmed.', 'Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.']"

Because the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we summarize in detail the evidence, considering it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 579 (2010). On January 7, 2007, Officer Sean Rooney was in a marked police cruiser and in uniform, patrolling an area in the Mattapan section of Boston. He was alone in his cruiser but was accompanied by another marked cruiser, operated by Officer Charlie Daniels. At about 6:30 P.M., the two police officers drove by 43 Harvard Street and observed two males standing outside on the top front step of the building. One was later identified as Daishaun Brown; the other was later identified as the defendant. The defendant made eye contact with Officer Rooney and then immediately turned and opened the outer door of 43 Harvard Street, but was unable to enter the building.', 'The officers parked their cruisers and spoke to the individuals. Officer Rooney spoke to the defendant, the other officer with Brown. Officer Rooney asked the defendant ""if he lived there and needed help with regard to getting access."" Both individuals seemed a little nervous and a little apprehensive but the defendant was not the subject of a patfrisk at that time. In answer to Officer Rooney\'s questions, the defendant stated that he did not live at that house, but was waiting for someone. At Officer Rooney\'s request, the defendant produced an identification card, handing it to the officer with his left hand. At that time, the defendant was also holding a cellular telephone, ""scrolling through and using the walkie-talkie feature."" While Officer Rooney was copying the defendant\'s identification card information, the defendant placed a full-fingered baseball batting glove on his right hand.', 'Page 39', 'As Officer Rooney finished copying the defendant\'s information, the defendant went to the front door of the building and opened it. Officer Rooney told the defendant, ""[D]on\'t go too far away. I still have your license. Come back and grab it. I\'m all set with it."" The defendant again reached out with his left hand and took back his identification card.', 'At that point, the owner of the building, Ms. Lewis, opened the door of the first-floor apartment that had been locked, came out, and asked, ""What\'s going on?"" Ms. Lewis was then asked, apparently by the defendant, ""Is Seyon there?"" Ms. Lewis told the defendant that she did not know him (the defendant) and that ""there\'s no one here."" The defendant responded, ""Well, Seyon has my thing, and I need to get it.""', ""He then pushed Ms. Lewis to one side, entered the first-floor apartment, and went down a hallway, followed by Ms. Lewis and Officer Rooney. The defendant entered a bedroom, followed by Ms. Lewis. She saw the defendant bending by the middle part of a bed, but she could not see what he was doing. Ms. Lewis left the room to get Officer Rooney and the defendant closed the door. Ms. Lewis came back with the officer and attempted to open the door, but could not. Officer Rooney also tried, unsuccessfully at first, to get the door open. He could tell that the door was being held shut from the inside while he was trying to push it open. Officer Rooney finally pushed the door open and found the defendant standing directly behind it, within arm's reach of the door. Officer Rooney immediately pat frisked the defendant and, not finding any weapon on him, brought him outside to the front stairs and ordered him to sit there."", ""Officer Rooney went back to the bedroom where he was informed that Ms. Lewis's grandson, Kamau, occupied the room and was taking a shower.

Kamau had known the defendant for about four or five', 'Page 40', ""years. The defendant was also a friend of Seyon Marshall, Kamau's cousin. See note 1, supra. Kamau stated that no one should be going into his room in his absence. At Officer Rooney's direction, Ms. Lewis, Kamau, and another police officer entered the room. Ms. Lewis asked Kamau to lift the mattress off the bed where the defendant was seen bending. A loaded handgun was found under the mattress. It was located near the foot of the mattress, an arm's length from the bedroom door. Kamau had last looked under the mattress the day before and had not seen a gun at that time. The firearm bore a single fingerprint of an unknown person."", ""The defendant did not testify at trial but through cross-examination and the testimony of the defendant's companion, Brown, offered the theory that he neither had the firearm on his person nor placed it under the mattress and that another individual, possibly Kamau, placed the gun there."", ""2. Sufficiency of the evidence. At trial, the Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that at the time the defendant was first confronted by Officer Rooney, the defendant was in actual possession of the firearm. Because the defendant was afraid that Office Rooney would discover the firearm, the defendant ran into the bedroom and placed the firearm under the mattress. The case was put to the jury on alternative theories of the defendant's actual or constructive possession of the firearm.

See Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 676-677 (1979)."" Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 456 Mass. at 582. Here, the actual possession theory advanced by the Commonwealth was not based on observations or fingerprints, but rather relied entirely on circumstantial evidence. Commonwealth v. Martino,', 'Page 41', '', ', 272 (1992) (""A conviction may be properly based entirely on circumstantial evidence so long as that evidence establishes the defendant\'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"").', 'The evidence presented at trial supported an inference that the defendant placed the firearm under the mattress. When first seen by the police, the defendant was attempting to enter 43 Harvard Street but was unable to open the door. When confronted by the police, he appeared ""nervous"" and ""apprehensive."" While talking to the police, the defendant placed a baseball batting glove on his right hand. Thereafter, when Ms. Lewis opened the previously locked door to the first-floor apartment and came out, the defendant pushed her to one side and ran into the apartment.', 'The defendant immediately entered a bedroom, closed the door, and prevented Ms. Lewis and Officer Rooney from entering the room. He was seen bending down near the middle part of the bed in which the firearm was found. The firearm had not been under the mattress the day before the incident. Therefore, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth supports the inference that the defendant, at the time of the initial confrontation with the police, had in his possession the firearm and, afraid it would be discovered, panicked, ran into the bedroom, and hid it under the mattress.', 'The evidence was also sufficient as to constructive possession. "" \'Constructive possession\' requires proof that the defendant had \'knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\' "" Commonwealth v. Sann Than,', ', 751 (2004), quoting from Commonwealth v. Sespedes,', ', 99 (2004). Knowledge may be established by circumstantial evidence ""if the evidence warrants a reasonable inference to that effect."" Commonwealth v. Cotto,', ', 592 (2007), quoting from Commonwealth v. Garcia,', "", 686 (1991). Intent to exercise dominion and control can be inferred from the defendant's conduct. See Commonwealth v. Whitlock,"", ', 519 (1995).

Valentin,', ', 671 (2002), quoting from Commonwealth v. Albano,', ', 134 (1977). Here, the presence of the defendant was supplemented by evidence that he ran to the bedroom, proceeded directly to the bed where the firearm was discovered, and attempted to prevent others from entering the room.', ""Therefore, we reject the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions of possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition."", '3. Ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the defendant claims that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because of misstatements made in his closing argument.

It is undisputed that no one testified to having observed the defendant with the firearm, or to having seen him place it under the mattress. Rather, Ms. Lewis, a Commonwealth witness, testified that when she got to the bedroom, ""I saw [the defendant] bending by the bed. I don\'t know what he was looking for, but he quickly got up. I turned around and went back outside."" Later, when she was asked by the prosecutor, ""And could you see if he was doing anything?"" she responded, ""No. I didn\'t see anything.""

Further, the prejudicial effect of the error was compounded by the prosecutor, who told the jury in her closing argument that the defendant was observed ""stashing [the firearm] by Ms. Lewis.""', ""The Commonwealth argues that the judge's instructions to the jury cured any error caused by the closing arguments.

One was from an individual who identified himself as Ed and asked to purchase $100 worth of cocaine. Detective Hyde informed him that he could fill the order and directed Ed to the intersection of Albion and Lowell Streets. When Ed reached that location, he placed a second telephone call to Detective Hyde, who sent a marked cruiser over. As the cruiser approached, Ed called again, saying that he should not be met at that intersection because the police were there.', 'The second call was from a woman who also sought to buy drugs. She asked for Ray or Ron and then asked to purchase cocaine for herself and marijuana for her niece. Detective Hyde said that he could satisfy her request and directed her to a nearby liquor store. Again, he sent a marked cruiser to the designated location. The woman later called and indicated that she had been stopped by the police, but still wanted to purchase drugs.', 'Detective Sergeant David Montana, the head of the Medford police department\'s drug-control unit, testified as an expert witness for the Commonwealth. Among other things, he explained what cocaine and marijuana look like, the forms they may take, and how they are ingested and packaged for sale. He stated that he ""believe[d]"" one substance in evidence was ""about half a gram"" of cocaine and that another substance ""appear[ed] to be marijuana."" In response to a hypothetical question, it was his', 'Page 478', 'opinion that the summary of the evidence put to him was not consistent with personal use.', ""b. The defendants' case. The theory of the defense was that the brothers were drug users, but not drug dealers, and that any drugs found in their apartment were for their own use. Ronald introduced the testimony of a friend who stated, among other things, that he would smoke marijuana with Ronald. Raymond introduced the expert testimony of Dr. Alan Wartenberg, a physician who specializes in the treatment of addiction and who described the consumption and purchasing habits of heavy drug users. In addition, each defendant testified on his own behalf."", 'Raymond testified that the records found by the police were for the purpose of keeping track of money that the defendants\' friends had donated to help them buy music studio time for Raymond\'s son, an aspiring musician. He also offered benign explanations for the presence of the significant amounts of cash found in the apartment. As for his drug use, Raymond said that he would purchase an ounce of marijuana each week and that he would roll the marijuana into a ""blunt"" cigar, sprinkle cocaine on top, and smoke it. He stated that he kept ""the drugs"" in the places where Detective Hyde said he found them in order to hide them from Ronald\'s children, who would come to visit. He also explained that he took ecstasy pills as a sex drug when ""a lady friend"" came to visit.', 'Ronald testified that he smoked marijuana every day, three to four times per day, and that he also used cocaine approximately three times per week. Like Raymond, he offered innocent explanations for the presence of cash in the apartment. He admitted that the bags of marijuana found in the pocket of the shirt in his closet and in the jacket in the living room were his, explaining that he had purchased marijuana for his personal use from a dealer who only sold it in ""dime bags,"" rather than in larger quantities. He also acknowledged that the cocaine found in his room was his.', ""2. Certificates of drug analysis. The Commonwealth had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substances seized from the defendants' apartment actually were marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy. Commonwealth v. Vasquez,"", ', 361 (2010). As held by the United States Supreme Court in', 'Page 479', ""Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), the admission of the certificates of drug analysis to meet the Commonwealth's burden, without affording the defendants the opportunity to cross-examine the chemical analyst who prepared them, violated the defendants' rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although the defendants did not object, on confrontation grounds, to the admission of the certificates at trial, because their case was tried after the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Verde,"", '(2005), and before the issuance of Melendez-Diaz, they are entitled to have this constitutional error reviewed under the ""harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard. Vasquez, supra, at 356-360.', '""[T]o establish harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt, the Commonwealth must show that other properly admitted evidence of guilt is \'overwhelming,\' in the sense that it is \'so powerful as to ""nullify any effect""\' that the improperly admitted evidence \'might have had\' on the fact finder or the findings."" Id. at 362, quoting from Commonwealth v. Tyree,', ', 704 n.44 (2010). ""We pay particular attention to whether the Commonwealth\'s case \'radiates from a core of tainted evidence.\' "" Commonwealth v. Fluellen,', ', 526 (2010), quoting Tyree, supra at 702. ""[W]here the improperly admitted evidence directly implicates the Commonwealth\'s proof of an element of the crime, our inquiry must necessarily focus on the effect of the improperly admitted evidence as it pertains to that element."" Vasquez, supra at 362.', 'In this case, although the Commonwealth introduced abundant properly admitted evidence of drug dealing, this evidence did not establish that the substances seized actually were cocaine, marijuana, and ecstasy as charged in the criminal complaints against the defendants. See Vasquez, supra at 366. See also Commonwealth v. Morales,', ', 668 (2010). Other than the certificates of drug analysis, the Commonwealth\'s evidence bearing in any respect on the nature of the substances consisted only of general descriptions by the police witnesses of the typical appearance of cocaine and marijuana, the conclusory use by witnesses of the words ""cocaine"" and ""marijuana"" to describe the substances found, the testimony of Detective', 'Page 480', 'Montana that he ""believe[d]"" one substance was ""about half a gram"" of cocaine and that the other substance ""appear[ed] to be marijuana,"" and Raymond\'s statement to Detective Hyde that there were ""some trees"" in his bedroom. This evidence is comparable to, and no stronger than, evidence in other cases where it has been held that the potent evidentiary effect of erroneously admitted certificates was not nullified. See Vasquez, supra at 365; Commonwealth v. Rivera,', ', 69-70 (2009), Commonwealth v. Melendez-Diaz,', ', 233 (2010); Commonwealth v. Pimentel,', ', 239 (2010); Commonwealth v.

Barbosa,', ', 344-345 (2010).', ""The Commonwealth maintains, however, that we also must take into account evidence admitted during the defendants' case -- in particular, the defendants' own testimony concerning their drug use."", ""We are unconvinced that it is appropriate for us to do so. The Supreme Judicial Court has indicated on more than one occasion that, short of a stipulation as to the nature of the drugs -- which, by express agreement, conclusively establishes the facts contained therein -- the Commonwealth is not relieved of its burden of proving the composition of the substances in question with properly admitted evidence. Commonwealth v. Vasquez, supra at 361, 368. This is so even where the defense strategy is to concede possession and contest only the defendant's intent to distribute, and even where the defendant has conveyed through words or conduct that the items in question are drugs. See Commonwealth v. Charles,"", ', 383 (2010); Commonwealth v. Fluellen, supra at 526-527.', '', 'We disagree with the dissent that admissions coming in the', 'Page 481', ""form of the defendants' sworn testimony at trial stand on a special footing and may form the basis for concluding that the admission of the certificates was harmless. In this regard, the case of Commonwealth v. Charros,"", ', cert. denied, 546 U.S. 870 (2005), is instructive. In Charros, one of the issues presented was whether the erroneous admission of incriminating evidence that should have been suppressed (money found in the defendant\'s purse when she was illegally seized by police) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In confronting that issue, the Charros court was required to consider the significance of the defendant\'s own trial testimony explaining and thereby admitting possession of the erroneously admitted evidence. After noting that there were conflicting views among courts and commentators on the point, the court rejected the Commonwealth\'s argument that the defendant\'s testimony rendered the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, observing that ""[i]t is virtually impossible to say, on this record, whether [the defendant] would have testified had the evidence been suppressed."" Id. at 766. Similarly, in the present case, we cannot know whether the defendants\' testimony was a response to the erroneous admission of the certificates and hence tainted by the error. We therefore conclude that we should not consider their testimony in analyzing the question of harmlessness, lest we compound the prejudicial effect of the certificates\' admission.', ""Unlike our dissenting colleague, we see no determinative distinction between this case and Charros. No less than in Charros, the defendants' testimony went to a potentially outcome-determinative issue; and, no less than in Charros, the defense strategy, including the defendants' decision to testify and any concessions made by counsel, was based upon the hand they were dealt. The defendants may well have made choices in light of the existing state of the law in Massachusetts, which allowed the Commonwealth to use certificates of drug analysis, without more, to meet its burden of proof as to the nature of the substances"", 'Page 482', 'forming the basis of the charges. See Vasquez, supra at 359-360, & 368 n.21.', 'In any event, even if we were to take the defendants\' testimony into account, we would not be assured that the impact of the drug certificates was nullified. While they admitted to being substantial users of drugs, and used the nomenclature ""marijuana"" and ""cocaine"" during their testimony, the defendants made no direct admissions about the composition of the charged substances. Compare Commonwealth v. Villatoro,', ', 652-653 & n. 11 (2010).', ""In short, when the issue properly is framed as whether there was overwhelming evidence, apart from the erroneously admitted certificates, of the actual nature of the substances forming the basis of the charges, we must conclude that there was not, whether or not the defendants' evidence is included in the analysis."", ""3. Other issues. The defendants' remaining arguments require little discussion."", 'a. Search warrant. There is no merit to the claim that the affidavit submitted by Detective Hyde in support of the application for a search warrant failed to establish the veracity of the two confidential informants referenced therein, and, hence, did not supply probable cause. See generally Commonwealth v. Upton,', ', 369-377 (1985) (adopting Aguilar-Spinelli', 'standard for purposes of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration', 'Page 483', 'of Rights). The affidavit established that the identity and places of residence of both informants were known to Detective Hyde, see Commonwealth v. Welch,', ', 651 (1995); that the information provided by both informants was extremely detailed, see Commonwealth v. Alfonso A.,', "", 376 (2003); that the informants corroborated each other; and that the information they supplied was further corroborated by police investigation and observation. Most significantly, the second informant engaged in two controlled buys, both within seven days of the application for the search warrant. See Commonwealth v. O'Day,"", ', 301 (2003).', ""Contrary to Raymond's position, it was not necessary for Detective Hyde to have personally observed the actual controlled buys. See Commonwealth v. Luthy,"", ', 106-108 (2007). Furthermore, the magistrate was entitled to conclude, for purposes of issuing the search warrant, that the substance purchased by the informant was, in fact, cocaine. See Commonwealth v. Byfield,', ', 430 (1992).', ""Ronald's additional contention that there was an insufficient nexus between any drug activity and the brothers' apartment is also groundless. In addition to two controlled buys made by the second informant, where the defendants were observed leaving their apartment and traveling directly to the prearranged buy location close to their residence, the first informant directly observed more than twenty cocaine and marijuana sales in the apartment and provided detailed information about where drugs and paraphernalia were kept at that location. Contrast Commonwealth v. Pina,"", ', 442 (2009).', ""b. Expert opinion. Detective Montana's opinion testimony did not exceed appropriate bounds. He provided general, educational information for the jury about the significance of certain facts and whether they were consistent with drug distribution rather than personal use. A hypothetical question posed to him, which closely reflected the trial evidence, was not impermissible. See Commonwealth v. Tanner,"", ', 579 (1998).', ""c. Calls to defendants' cellular telephones. For the first time on appeal, the defendants contend that Detective Hyde's testimony concerning calls placed to the defendants' cellular"", 'Page 484', 'telephones was inadmissible hearsay and violated their rights of confrontation.', ""It is evident, however, that the testimony was not offered for the truth of the statements made by the callers, but, rather, was offered for the nonhearsay purpose of establishing that the telephones were instrumentalities employed by the defendants to facilitate the sale of drugs. The defendants' intent to distribute was the core issue in the case, and the prosecutor used the testimony concerning the telephone calls to argue that the defendants had organized and equipped themselves to sell, and not merely to use, drugs. Because the testimony was not hearsay, the confrontation clause was not implicated. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 59 n.9 (2004); Commonwealth v. Brum,"", ', 116 (2002).', ""The defendants' alternative argument that the judge was required sua sponte to give a limiting instruction when this testimony was received is without merit. See Commonwealth v. Washington,"", ', 488 (2007).', ""4. Conclusion. Because we are unable to determine that the admission of certificates of drug analysis played little or no role in the outcome of the case, we conclude that this constitutional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the defendants' convictions are reversed, and the verdicts set aside."", 'So ordered.', '', '(dissenting in part). With due respect, I dissent from that part of the majority opinion which holds that the admission of the drug certificates was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I also depart from the majority in the suggestion that it is not the whole trial record -- Commonwealth case-in-chief and defense case -- which is to be considered in determining the question whether an error, here the admission of the certificates, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', '', 'Page 485', 'Consideration of the entire trial record of prosecution and defense evidence. Under Commonwealth v. Vasquez,', '(2010), the standard of review is whether the error in the introduction of the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In reviewing whether an error is so harmless, it is the trial record in its entirety, including both the Commonwealth\'s and the defendants\' evidence, that is to be considered. ""[A]n appellate court must ask \'whether on the', 'before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury\'s verdicts.\' "" Id. at 369 (Cordy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), quoting from Commonwealth v.

[and] whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence."" Vasquez, 456 Mass. at 360 n.12, quoting from Tyree, 455 Mass. at 701.', ""The defendants' testimony rendered the error in the admission of the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Contrary to the majority, I would conclude that the admission of the drug certificates was harmless error, because in addition to other expert evidence concerning what the substances were, both defendants -- in order to explain the existence of the cocaine and marijuana found in their rooms and in other parts of the apartment -- took the stand at trial, acknowledged that the drugs were theirs, and explicitly admitted in their testimony that the substances were, in fact, cocaine and marijuana, the defendants contending only that these controlled substances"", 'Page 486', 'were being held for personal use. The defendant Ronald Mendes testified that the marijuana and cocaine seized in his room belonged to him, and that he smoked marijuana every day and used cocaine three times a week, sometimes adding the cocaine to his ""weed"" and making a ""blunt."" The defendant Raymond Mendes acknowledged that he kept cocaine and marijuana in the apartment, used these substances himself and with his codefendant twin brother Ronald,', 'and also acknowledged that he gave the substances to guests, ""do[ing] the blunt and the cocaine . . . that\'s when I have a lady friend come over."" Raymond offered details about how to roll the marijuana into a ""blunt"" cigar by taking out the tobacco.', ""All of this was powerful substantive evidence, direct from the mouths of the defendants, that the substances were, in fact, cocaine and marijuana. In addition, the defense offered an expert on addictive drug use, who described the practice of using cocaine and marijuana -- seeking to buttress and corroborate the defendants' testimony to the effect that, even if the marijuana and cocaine taken from the apartment belonged to the defendants, the drugs so held by the defendants would be consistent with personal consumption, rather than distribution. There was also expert testimony in the Commonwealth's case-in-chief by a qualified police expert who examined the exhibits containing the controlled substances, described what cocaine and marijuana look like, and stated that the substances packaged in the exhibits appeared to be cocaine and marijuana."", ""Thus, apart from, and cumulative to, the drug certificate evidence, the defendants' testimonial admissions, the defense drug expert's corroborating evidence, and the prosecution drug qualified drug expert, taken in totality, provided persuasive probative evidence that the substances were cocaine and marijuana. Therefore, applying the standards from the Vasquez and Tyree cases quoted above, in my opinion, this other independent evidence rendered the error in admission of the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."", 'To be noted is that all of this other drug identifying information was introduced at trial as substantive evidence. Hence, this', 'Page 487', ""is not case in which, in counter to the government's evidence, a defense strategy is advanced not by introducing evidence in the defense case (including, perhaps, as here by the defendants' testimony), but rather the defense strategy is pursued though the means of counsel's opening statement and closing argument, and counsel's interrogation of witnesses in an effort to persuade the fact finder at trial, that, even assuming illicit drugs were present, such drugs were for personal use."", 'To the contrary, there was more than a defense theory advanced in this case; instead, substantive evidence was developed of and concerning the subject drugs being cocaine and marijuana. Given this substantive evidence, the principle applies to this case that, ""[p]roof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis and may be made circumstantial evidence."" Commonwealth v. Dawson,', ', 467 (1987). ""[S]uch evidence may be \'so powerful\' as to \'nullify any effect\' that the drug certificates \'might have had on the jury or the verdict[s].\' "" Commonwealth v. Charles,', ', 381-382 (2010), quoting from Tyree, supra at 704 n.44.', ""That the most probative testimony concerning the nature of the unlawful controlled substances was forthcoming in the defendants' own words -- and reflected a wealth of experience"", 'Page 488', 'in using the drugs by these defendants -- sharpens the proof line because it is each defendant who inculpated himself and provided direct substantive, probative evidence about the nature of the controlled substances. Thus, in this case, the defendants\' trial testimony and defense evidence went far to prove the nature of the drugs. In my judgment, a defendant cannot have it both ways, i.e., take the stand at trial and testify that the controlled substances were particular drugs, and then shift stance to contend on appeal that a conviction was fraught with error because certificates of drug analysis were introduced. Such switches are, in effect, a disavowal of the defendant\'s testimonial acknowledgment under oath that the substances were certain unlawful substances, here cocaine and marijuana. Here, in considering whether the error in admitting the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendants should be held to their words under oath at trial. Cf. United States v. Havens, 446 U.S. 620, 626-627 (1980) (this Court has ""repeatedly insisted that when defendants testify, they must testify truthfully or suffer the consequences. . . . The defendant\'s obligation to testify truthfully is fully binding on him"").', ""To the defendants' testimony, I would add, in the harmless error calculus, the prosecution's police expert who described what cocaine and marijuana look like, and the various forms of these controlled substances and methods of packaging for sale, and the theme of the defense drug expert that, even though cocaine and marijuana may were involved, such drugs may be for personal use. All this evidence, when bundled -- and even when assessed apart from the chemical analysis in the erroneously admitted drug certificates -- brings this case within the core of the class of substantive and circumstantial evidence which Commonwealth v. Dawson, supra, held may prove the nature of an unlawful drug."", 'The majority relies on Commonwealth v. Charros,', ', cert. denied, 546 U.S. 870 (2005). But I do not see Charros as providing legal justification for the defendants being able to say one thing at trial under oath -- acknowledging that the controlled substances were cocaine and marijuana and offering a defense drug expert to the same effect -- but, then postconviction, on appeal, stepping away from the defense evidence presented.', 'Page 489', ""First, I do not believe that Charros, which involved a defendant's trial testimony following the erroneous denial of a suppression motion, is apposite. In Charros, the court focused on the prejudicial effect of the defendant's testimony, which may not have been given had the evidence been suppressed. Specifically, the defendant's trial testimony that she had taken money from a strong box provided a critical link to the twenty-eight grams of cocaine. The point is: there was an important and potentially outcome-determinative contested issue in Charros concerning whether the defendant had knowledge that cocaine was being held in the apartment for distribution, versus a defense position that she was not aware of her husband's drug business. In this case, there is no such contested defense issue, given the defendants' concessions that the drugs were cocaine and marijuana, albeit supposedly held for personal use."", 'A second reason Charros is inapposite is that the court noted in that case that, ""[i]t is virtually impossible to say, on this record, whether [the defendant] would have testified had the evidence been suppressed."" Id. at 766. That is absolutely not so in this case. To the contrary, it is perfectly clear from the case record here -- beginning with trial counsels\' openings that the defendants would testify, would acknowledge that the substances were cocaine and marijuana, and would offer expert evidence to that end.', '', 'Page 490', 'Third, looking to Charros, the majority concludes that the defendant\'s testimony is not ""countable"" because the govern ment has the burden of proof on all elements of a case. That is, of course, so. But, we are not here considering appellate review of a motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the government\'s case, where only the evidence in the Commonwealth case-in-chief counts. Rather, we are reviewing the entire case record, including the defense case -- all, I submit, to be counted in the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt analysis. For these reasons, Charros, in my view, cannot be read to warrant reversal in this case because of the Melendez-Diaz and Vasquez error.', 'In certain respects, this case is similar to Commonwealth v. Villatoro,', ', 652 (2010), in which we held that admission of the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In that case, ""[t]he defendant not only admitted that the substance in question was marijuana, he testified at length on the subject, asserting the distinction between different grades of \'weed,\' explaining why he also had smoking implements and baggies on his person, and detailing his experience and long history of marijuana use. . . . Additionally, the arresting officer recounted that he had received Drug Enforcement Administration task force training and ATF drug recognition training; he testified further that he also recognized the odor of marijuana when he approached the defendant based on his own experience, including hundreds of marijuana arrests."" Id. at 652-654.', 'In addition, the majority opinion in this case appears', 'Page 491', 'to be inconsistent with the holding in Commonwealth v. DeMatos,', '(2010). In DeMatos, this court held that the error in admission of drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the evidence was that the defendant, by an out-of-court admission, stated that he was using cocaine at the time of his arrest. This out-of-court admission was, in turn, buttressed by police officer\'s testimony that the defendant appeared ""high"" when apprehended. If, as in DeMatos, such an out-of-court admission, coupled with other evidence of drug distribution, rendered the admission of the drug certificates harmless error, I fail to see how an in-court admission by a defendant under oath, also buttressed by other evidence, is to be afforded less weight in the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt analysis. Yet, to accept the majority analysis is to do that, inconsistently with DeMatos. That is, while this court has in that latter case afforded weight to an out-of-court admission by a defendant, the majority opinion in this case would not afford equal or greater weight to a defendant\'s in-court testimony under oath that a substance is a particular unlawful drug, here cocaine.', 'In sum, taking the defendants\' testimonial admissions that the substances were cocaine, the defense expert evidence centering on these two controlled substances and the police expert testimony, I would conclude that the error in admitting the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. ""[S]o powerful [was all of this other evidence] as to nullify any effect that the improperly admitted evidence might have had on the fact finder or the findings.""

Two months later a second jury trial was held before the same judge, at which time each defendant was convicted of two counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Before us are the defendants' appeals from the judgments of conviction and from the denial of their motions for a new trial."", ""The defendants' primary claim arises from the trial judge's denial of their requests to obtain a transcript of the first trial for use in the second trial. While we agree that the transcript should have been made available to them, we conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the defendants are not entitled to appellate relief. We further conclude that, as conceded by the Commonwealth, an omission in the judge's instructions on joint venture requires that defendant White's convictions of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon be reversed. In all other respects, we affirm."", 'Background. The Commonwealth introduced evidence from which the jury could find that, on August 22, 2007, White lured the victim, Donald Reynolds, to a designated location in Adams, where he was beaten by Luciano and another man, Timothy Malloy. At one time or another, Malloy, Reynolds and Luciano all had been involved with White. Indeed, each of them had fathered a child with her. For some period prior to the beating incident, White had been living with Luciano. However, after discovering that Reynolds had won some money at a casino, she began to see him again and led him to believe that they were dating.', 'Reynolds had strong feelings for White. After learning that Luciano had fathered a child with another woman, Reynolds', 'Page 56', ""tried to use that fact to persuade White to reunite with him permanently. White told Reynolds that she would leave Luciano if Reynolds could corroborate the accusation. Reynolds therefore paid the other woman for a copy of papers containing test results establishing Luciano's paternity."", 'On the day of the beating, Reynolds went with White to a shopping mall and spent thousands of dollars on her and her children. Within a few hours, however, Reynolds spotted White and her children in the company of Luciano at a McDonald\'s ""drive-thru."" A heated argument (but no violence) ensued between the two men.', 'That evening, White called Reynolds to tell him that what happened at McDonald\'s was ""stupid."" She also told him that she would like to confront Luciano with the paternity papers, but was afraid to do so herself. She informed Reynolds that if he gave the papers to Luciano, she would kiss him, announce that she would marry him, and they would ""ride off"" together. Later that night, she left several voice mail messages for Reynolds telling him that she was with Malloy and Luciano on Spring Street, and urging him to come over.', ""After listening to the messages, Reynolds went to Spring Street. When he arrived, White pointed him down an alley to a door, which (unbeknownst to Reynolds) was the entrance to Malloy's residence. After Reynolds refused to walk down the alley, White went to the door and knocked on it. Reynolds then caught sight of Luciano hiding in the alley and walked towards him."", ""Reynolds and Luciano began to argue. As they did, Malloy came from somewhere to the left of Reynolds and began to beat him on the head with a large, heavy glass bottle. Luciano, who worked as a security guard, joined in the attack, using a long, black security flashlight to strike Reynolds. Eventually, White and Luciano departed together in White's car, and Malloy, too, left the scene. Reynolds was left bleeding and lying on the ground until help arrived."", ""The theory of the defense was that the defendants had nothing to do with Reynolds' beating and that, after being attacked by one or more other individuals, Reynolds accused the defendants because he was upset and angry that White was choosing Luciano over him."", 'Page 57', 'Discussion. 1. Transcript. Immediately after the completion of the first trial, White, who previously had been found to be indigent, moved for funds to obtain the transcript of the prior proceedings, stating in her motion that ""a certified copy of the transcript of the prior trial [was] necessary for her to properly prepare for the upcoming [re]trial."" The motion requested a hearing at the court\'s earliest convenience and was accompanied by an affidavit of counsel attesting to White\'s continued indigency and inability to pay for the transcript. The judge denied the motion without a hearing. As he later explained,', 'his reason for denying the motion was that the ""general, non-specific reason"" offered by White was ""insufficient to incur the expense and time necessary to obtain such transcript,"" and because delaying the trial in order to obtain a transcript would have been ""inconsistent with the rights of the defendants and the Commonwealth for timely adjudication of criminal matters.""', ""On the first day of the second trial, the transcript issue arose again. Immediately after the prosecutor's direct examination of Reynolds, Luciano's counsel orally moved that, if nothing else, Reynold's testimony from the first trial should be transcribed over the weekend so that it could be used to impeach Reynolds during cross-examination on a particular detail of his direct testimony, i.e., that he was holding the paternity papers in his hand when he approached Luciano. The judge said that this would be impossible, and denied the request. Both defendants objected."", 'Requests by indigent defendants for funds to prepare their defense are governed by G. L. c. 261, §§ 27A-27G. Pertinent here, G. L. c. 261, § 27C(4), as amended by St. 1980, c. 539, § 7, provides: ""If the court makes a finding of indigency, it shall not deny any request with respect to normal fees and costs, and it shall not deny any request with respect to extra fees and costs if it finds the document, service or object is', 'to assure the applicant as effective a prosecution, defense or appeal as he would have if he were financially able to pay.', '; and if there is an appeal pursuant to section twenty-seven D following a denial, the court shall, within three days, set forth its written findings and reasons justifying such denial, which', 'Page 58', 'document shall be part of the record on appeal.""', '(Emphasis supplied.)', ""As mandated by § 27C(4), White's motion should not have been denied without a hearing. Indeed, this case well illustrates the utility of such a requirement. As the record stands, the judge's concerns about delay are unsubstantiated. A hearing could have shed light on the amount of time needed for production of the transcript, whether it was feasible to obtain the transcript on an expedited basis, and whether the defendants were willing to waive their rights to a speedy trial in order to secure the transcript before the retrial."", '', 'Even more fundamentally, the denial of White\'s motion on the ground that she failed to make a particularized showing of need was a violation of her constitutional right to equal protection, as established in Britt v. North Carolina, 404 U.S. 226 (1971). In that case, the United States Supreme Court concluded that State courts generally must provide indigent defendants with a free copy of the transcript of a mistrial for use in a subsequent trial without requiring the defendant to specify how the transcript might be useful. Id. at 228. As the Supreme Court observed, ""even in the absence of specific allegations it can ordinarily be assumed that a transcript of a prior mistrial would be valuable to the defendant in at least two ways: as a discovery device in preparation for trial, and as a tool at the trial itself for the impeachment of prosecution witnesses."" Ibid. Thus, to be consistent with the constitutional requirements discussed in Britt, the ""reasonably necessary"" standard of § 27C(4) generally must be deemed to be met whenever a defendant requests funds', 'Page 59', ""for the transcript of a prior mistrial, even if the defendant has not made a specific showing of the transcript's utility."", '', ""While it may be that the judge nevertheless had discretion to deny the midtrial request of Luciano's counsel for partial transcription because of its timing and the practical difficulties it presented, we need not decide the issue, because neither that ruling nor the judge's ruling on White's motion necessitates appellate relief. The only prejudice claimed by the defendants is their alleged inability to have impeached Reynolds on a minor detail -- whether, when walking towards Luciano in the alley, he had the paternity papers in his hand, as he testified on direct examination."", 'According to the defendants, if they had been able to show that Reynolds was not holding the papers as he went down the alley, his account of why he came to Spring Street would ""not make any sense."" We think, however, that the defendants greatly exaggerate the value of establishing this discrepancy.', 'Whether Reynolds actually had the paternity papers in hand when he saw Luciano and walked towards him bore no relationship to the main issue in the case, which was whether the defendants were present and participated (as principal or joint venturer) in the beating.', ""The proposed impeachment went only to the collateral issue of Reynolds' general credibility. See Commonwealth v. Farley,"", ', 750-751 (2005). As to that issue, the defendants had at their disposal far more potent evidence that apparently did not persuade the jury to disbelieve', 'Page 60', 'Reynolds.', ""Furthermore, even without the benefit of the transcript, Luciano's counsel was able to draw on his memory of the prior trial to cross-examine Reynolds effectively on the paternity papers -- eliciting an admission that Reynolds was uncertain and confused about whether he had them in his possession when he walked down the alley. In these circumstances, the failure to afford the defendants a transcript of the mistrial was inconsequential. Accordingly, even though the error was of constitutional dimension, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."", 'See generally Commonwealth v. Tague,', ', 515-516 (2001).', ""2. Instructions on joint venture. It is not disputed that the judge's final charge did not inform the jury that in order to find either of the defendants guilty of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon on a theory of joint venture, it was necessary for the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that his or her coventurer was armed with a dangerous weapon."", 'Because neither defendant objected at trial,', 'we consider only whether the omission created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Commonwealth v. Redmond,', ', 7 (2001).', 'Page 61', 'As to defendant White, the Commonwealth concedes that her convictions cannot stand. After independent review, see Commonwealth v. McClary,', ', 686 n.6 (1992), we conclude that the concession is appropriate. On the state of the evidence, the jury could have found that, although White laid a trap for Reynolds to be assaulted by Luciano and Malloy, she did not know that Luciano and Malloy had dangerous weapons.', 'As to defendant Luciano, we discern no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice resulting from the omitted instruction. There were two distinct charges against Luciano: a charge of ""assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, to wit: a flashlight,"" which was based upon his own actions; and a charge of ""assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, to wit: a glass bottle,"" which was based upon the actions of Luciano\'s alleged coventurer, Malloy. The evidence was that Malloy initiated the physical attack on Reynolds by coming at him from the left and striking him with the bottle, that Luciano immediately joined in by hitting Reynolds with a flashlight, and that Luciano and Malloy continued to strike Reynolds at the same time, using their respective weapons. In these circumstances, there was no real risk that the jury would have reached a different result had they been told expressly that they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Luciano knew that Malloy was armed. See Commonwealth v. Palmer,', ', 426 (2003).', '', '3. Other issues. a. Police officer testimony. Although he did not object below, defendant Luciano now claims that the investigating police officer gave what amounted to an improper expert opinion as to guilt. The officer testified that after speaking with Reynolds as he lay bleeding in the road and after making observations at the scene, the officer notified other police officers that there was ""probable cause to arrest"" two individuals: Luciano and Malloy. We disagree that this testimony was an impermissible comment on the defendants\' guilt; it was an explanation of', 'Page 62', ""the officer's actions, elicited to counteract the defendants' claim from the inception of the trial that the police investigation was inadequate and misdirected. See Commonwealth v. Lodge,"", ', 467 (2000); Commonwealth v. Avila,', ', 753-754 (2009); Commonwealth v. Flanagan,', ', 476 n.2 (1985).', ""In any event, no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice resulted from the admission of this testimony. The officer's determination that there was probable cause to arrest was implicit in the arrest itself. Furthermore, in view of the judge's thorough instructions as to the jury's function, the presumption of innocence, and the Commonwealth's obligation to prove the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, we are confident that the jury would not have understood the officer's testimony that, at the time, he believed that the lesser probable cause standard had been met, as supplanting their responsibility as fact finders or as diminishing the Commonwealth's burden of proof."", ""b. Ineffective assistance of counsel. We have reviewed the defendants' various claims of ineffective assistance and conclude that they fall short under the Saferian standard. Commonwealth v. Saferian,"", ', 96 (1974). The unpreserved errors already discussed fare no better when recast in terms of ineffective assistance. See Commonwealth v. Randolph,', "", 295-296 (2002). The evidentiary objections that the defendants claim their trial counsel should have made most likely would have been futile or would have made no material difference in the case. White's trial counsel cannot be faulted for deciding not to mount a weak alibi defense that did not account for the time when the crime occurred; nor was he ineffective in failing to call Malloy as a witness, where Malloy was asserting his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Notably, White's claims are unsupported by any affidavits from trial counsel, Malloy, or herself. The motion judge, who also was the trial judge, was entitled to reject them."", ""4. Conclusion.

There, Morales met and befriended the defendant, who began working as a receptionist in February, 2006, under a work-release program for prerelease inmates committed to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Framingham (MCI Framingham).', 'Morales and the defendant became close friends. Morales, who was only 21 years old, viewed the defendant as a ""mother figure"" and trusted her. The defendant told Morales that she was not living with her husband and children but was in prison because her boss had been trading stocks and bonds illegally.', ""One day in April, 2006, Morales noticed that the defendant was upset and asked what was wrong. The defendant told Morales that the cellular telephone company had shut off her husband's"", 'Page 181', ""telephone service because he had supplied the wrong bank information. She told Morales that she did not have a credit card of her own and needed one so the telephone could be reconnected. The defendant convinced Morales to allow her to use Morales' debit card, issued by Middlesex Savings Bank and bearing a Visa logo, as a form of surety for the telephone company. She promised that no charges would accrue to Morales. The defendant then wrote Morales' debit card number on a scrap of paper."", 'Morales thought this strange, but the defendant assured her that she only wrote it down ""in case [the transaction] doesn\'t go through"" so that ""I don\'t have to keep bugging you for your card.""', ""About a week later, the defendant complained to Morales that she felt uncomfortable because she did not look professional enough in the uniform that the work-release program required her to wear. Although Morales assured the defendant that she looked fine, the defendant told Morales that she was going to order some clothing from Chadwick's, an on-line clothing store, and she asked Morales if she could have the clothes sent to Morales' house because she did not know when she would be seeing her husband. Morales agreed, and when the clothing arrived, she brought it to Bernardi's and gave it to the defendant."", ""Subsequently, the defendant convinced Morales to make a purchase from Chadwick's despite Morales' reluctance to purchase clothing for herself until she had done so for her daughters. The defendant then suggested that since she was going to place another order for herself using her husband's credit card, she and Morales should place their separate orders at the same time and have both delivered to Morales' address as before. Morales acquiesced, and the defendant purported to place both orders."", ""About one week later, on May 7, 2006, the defendant's scheme began to unravel when Morales overheard the defendant placing a telephone order for a pizza using Morales' debit card information. Not wanting to confront the defendant without proof, Morales decided to wait until a charge was posted to her account. Two days later, when Morales' bank statement reflected a charge of $50.62 from Pizza Plus, she questioned the defenant, who"", 'Page 182', ""responded that she was sorry and must have confused her husband's credit card number with Morales' debit card number."", ""Alarmed at what was occurring, Morales telephoned Chadwick's and learned that rather than two separate orders there was but a single order in Morales' name alone for $1,200."", 'Morales was distraught at this discovery and immediately telephoned her bank.

The evidence just summarized amply established that, without Morales\' knowledge or consent and with intent to defraud, the defendant used Morales\' debit card to make purchases of clothing, a mobile telephone, telephone services, food, and Registry of Motor Vehicle services, in excess of $250. The defendant argues, notwithstanding, that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support conviction of fraudulent use of a credit card under G. L. c. 266, § 37C(e), because the instrument used was Morales\' ""debit card"" rather than her ""credit card."" The defendant contends that because the debit card drew upon Morales\' own funds at the bank, the transaction lacked the requisite obtaining of goods or services ""on credit"" to support conviction. Viewing the governing statutes in context and in their entirety, we disagree. See Commonwealth v. Roucoulet,', ', 650, 653 (1992) (court must view statute in its entire context, not construing it to defeat obvious intention of Legislature nor manufacturing ambiguity to invoke rule of lenity to defeat that intent); Commonwealth v. Kneram,', ', 376-377 (2005).', 'General Laws c. 266, §§ 37A-37C, render unlawful the misuse and fraudulent use of any instrument or device, however denominated, issued by a business organization or financial institution', 'to facilitate the movement of money, goods, services,', 'Page 184', 'or anything else of value without immediate payment. Section 37B prohibits the misuse of ""credit cards"" by applicants, holders, and those who furnish goods or other things of value to the holder of such a card, and § 37C prohibits the fraudulent use of such cards to obtain money, goods or services or anything else of value. Overarching the statutory framework is the definition of ""[c]redit card"" in § 37A as ""any instrument or device, whether known as a credit card, credit plate,', ', issued with or without fee by an issuer for the use of the cardholder in obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value', '"" (emphasis supplied).', 'We agree with the Commonwealth that for purposes of G. L. c. 266, §§ 37A-37C, a debit card is the functional equivalent of a credit card.', ""See generally Cumis Ins. Soc., Inc. v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc."", ', 462-463 (2009) (treating debit card as equivalent of credit card in context of scheme involving theft of card data). A debit card, like its credit card counterpart, is an ""instrument or device . . . issued with or without fee by an issuer"" (here Middlesex Savings Bank) ""for the use of the cardholder"" (here Morales) ""in obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value on credit."" G. L. c. 266, § 37A. The defendant\'s argument that a debit card does not involve the obtaining of things of value ""on credit"" focuses too narrowly on only one facet of a debit card transaction, that between the issuer and the cardholder. See ibid.', ""We acknowledge that unlike a credit card transaction, in which a cardholder borrows funds from an issuer for a grace period or longer, a debit card transaction involves no similar extension of credit from the issuer to the cardholder because the cardholder's own funds, not those of the issuer, are drawn upon when the transaction is later posted and money is credited to the merchant. Nevertheless, a debit card transaction does involve an extension of credit at the point of sale and at least until the funds are later deducted from the cardholder's account by the issuer"", 'Page 185', 'and credited to the merchant\'s account (through acquiring bank intermediaries). See Cumis Ins. Soc., Inc. v. BJ\'s Wholesale Club, Inc., supra at 462-463 (""After the transaction is approved, the acquiring bank acquires the merchant\'s Visa or MasterCard receipt, pays the merchant for the amount of the transaction, and seeks payment from the issuing bank; the issuing bank pays the acquiring bank and debits the cardholder\'s account""). See also Black\'s Law Dictionary 424 (9th ed. 2009) (distinguishing between ""consumer credit,"" which is ""[c]redit extended to an individual to facilitate the purchase of consumer goods and services,"" and ""bank credit,"" which is ""[c]redit that a bank makes available to a borrower""). Although a debit card transaction does not involve the continued extension of credit after the settling of accounts that arises in a credit card transaction, a debit card transaction is nevertheless ""on credit"" for purposes of the statutory proscription against fraudulent use.', ""Indeed, debit cards and credit cards are virtually indistinguishable. The same plastic card often functions as both a debit card and a credit card, and whether the card is to be used as a debit card (drawing on the cardholder's own funds) or as credit card (obtaining a loan of funds for a grace period or longer) depends entirely on the option chosen by the cardholder at the point of sale."", 'The defendant\'s proposed construction of the statute would render a misuse or fraudulent use of a card dependent on the fortuity that the wrongdoer chose ""credit"" rather than ""debit"" at the point of sale. We cannot imagine that the Legislature intended such an absurd result. See Commonwealth v. Roucoulet, 413 Mass. at 652 (disapproving of proposed interpretation that would create a loophole in criminal law unlikely to be endorsed by Legislature); Commonwealth v. Tata,', ', 25-26 (1989); Commonwealth v. Kneram, 63 Mass.

We do not perceive any ambiguity in the conduct proscribed such that an ordinary person would mistakenly understand the prohibited conduct to be unlawful if committed with a credit card but lawful if done with a debit card. See Commonwealth v. Roucoulet, supra at 652-653 (rule of lenity does not apply and ""maxim that penal statutes are to be strictly construed does not mean that an available and sensible interpretation is to be rejected in favor of a fanciful or perverse one"" that ""create[s] great practical difficulty in the enforcement of the law"").', '3.

We discern no such requirement in G. L. c. 266, § 40."", ""The defendant's proposed construction ignores the clear statutory language that permits conviction as a common and notorious thief in two different instances. The first, which applies here, arises when one who has been convicted upon an indictment for larceny is later charged and convicted upon an indictment of another larceny. The second arises when, whether upon"", 'Page 187', 'indictment or upon a complaint, one is tried and convicted of three separate larcenies at the same sitting of the court. See Commonwealth v. Mills,', ', 388 (2002).', '4. Specific unanimity. The judge did not err in refusing to provide a specific unanimity instruction. The Commonwealth proceeded on a theory that the defendant used the victim\'s debit card as a continuing course of conduct comprising a single criminal episode that, in aggregate, amounted to larceny and fraudulent use of a credit card in excess of $250. A specific unanimity instruction is called for ""when, on a single charged offense, the prosecutor presents evidence of separate, discrete incidents, any one of which would suffice by itself to make out the crime charged."" Commonwealth v. Santos,', ', 284-285 (2003). Here, there was no danger of the juror confusion that underlies a specific unanimity instruction because none of the individual instances of theft other than that from Chadwick\'s exceeded the statutory minimum of $250. See id. at 285 (""[I]f the offense is alleged to have been committed as part of a single episode, there is no . . . risk of juror confusion and no specific unanimity instruction need be given"").', 'Moreover, a specific unanimity instruction is not required where there is but a single larceny comprised of ""successive takings . . . actuated by a single, continuing, criminal impulse or intent . . . pursuant to the execution of a general larcenous scheme.""

Jury instruction.

See Commonwealth v. Blake,', ', 827 (1992).

Pina,', ', 440-441 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. O\'Day, 440 Mass. at 304 (single observation of drug dealer leaving his residence to go to drug transaction did not provide sufficient nexus). ""Information establishing that a person is guilty of a crime does not necessarily constitute probable cause to search the person\'s residence."" Commonwealth v.', 'Page 266', 'Cinelli, 389 Mass. at 213. ""It follows that probable cause to expect that drugs will be present in a home is not established by the fact that the defendant lives there."" Commonwealth v. Pina, 453 Mass. at 441. Just as residency alone does not establish probable cause, ""the fact that a defendant drives from his home to the location of a drug transaction, and returns to his home on the transaction\'s conclusion, with', 'connecting the residence to drug sales, does not provide probable cause to search the residence"" (emphasis added). Commonwealth v. Medina,', "", 1011 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. Pina, 453 Mass. at 441 (single round trip to and from drug transaction did not establish probable cause to search residence). Among the infinite variety of additional facts human behavior can provide (together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them) to establish probable cause to search a residence, one cannot exclude a drug dealer's pattern of leaving and returning to his residence for each drug sale. A pattern of repeated activity giving rise to a reasonable inference that a dealer's residence is being used as the base for his drug operation provides sufficient nexus to search his residence."", 'Summarized, the facts in the affidavit in this case were as follows. A confidential informant (CI) told police that he (a pronoun used for convenience, not to signify gender) knew of a heroin dealer in Brockton who used two different automobiles (one a white Toyota, the other a green Audi with fancy wheels) to deliver drugs to prearranged locations. Using this information, the police worked with the CI to make four controlled purchases of heroin over the next two weeks. On each of these occasions, the CI called the defendant by telephone and asked for a specific quantity of drugs. The defendant then specified the location at which to meet. The defendant arrived by car (either the white Toyota or the green Audi) and picked up the CI. He drove a short distance with the CI in the car, during which a sale of heroin took place. The CI was then let out of the car. After each of these sales, the defendant drove directly to his residence, and parked the car in the parking lot. He then entered the house through its rear entrance, located near the basement. In addition, on one of these occasions, police observed the defendant drive the Toyota away from his residence a few', 'Page 267', 'minutes after arranging a sale by telephone with the CI. The defendant then drove directly to the prearranged location where he sold drugs to the CI.', ""On two additional occasions during the same two-week period, the defendant was observed to leave his residence, get directly into the Audi, and drive to a location where he picked up a woman, drove a short distance, and then dropped her off. He returned directly to his residence. This behavior was in all material respects identical to the defendant's modus operandi in the controlled purchases and it takes no leap of imagination to infer that these too were drug transactions."", 'See Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 576 (2008), quoting from Commonwealth v. Jimenez,', ', 218 (2002) (""affidavits in support of search warrants are to be approached with a view toward common sense, read in their entirety and with considerable latitude allowed for the drawing of inferences""). On the first of these two occasions, the defendant took counter measures while driving to ensure he was not followed. Also on this occasion, after parking the Audi when he returned home, he opened the driver\'s door of the Toyota and then its hood. After looking around to ensure he was not being watched, he either took something from the engine compartment or placed something in it. He then went inside his residence, using the rear door.', ""In summary, the defendant was seen leaving and returning to his residence multiple times to what were either known drug sales or to encounters that could readily be inferred to be drug transactions. A pattern of activity such as this, in our view, provides sufficient nexus to a dealer's residence to satisfy probable cause to search it. In addition, the defendant's use of multiple cars makes it more likely that he stored drugs in his residence, rather than in the vehicles. Moreover, whatever the defendant was storing in the engine compartment of the Toyota, he had no need to access it on the way to a sale. Rather, that material was either deposited into the compartment after a sale or taken from the compartment into his house. Either way, it bolsters the inference that drugs were stored in the house, rather than in the vehicles. Furthermore, the defendant always used the rear"", 'Page 268', ""entrance to the house, and the landlord confirmed that the occupants of the defendant's apartment were the only people (in addition to the owner) who had access to the locked basement and a locked storage container that were located at the rear of the house."", ""The defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied."", '3. Other issues. We address briefly the other issues raised by the defendant. The judge correctly determined that the defendant did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the basement to which the landlord also had full access. See Commonwealth v. Williams,', "", 208-209 (2009) (and cases cited therein). Finally, there was no error in denying the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty regarding the charges based on items discovered in the basement. The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to allow a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had constructive possession over the items in the basement."", ""For the reasons set forth above, the defendant's conviction of possession of ammunition (indictment no. 06-00182-003) is affirmed. The judgments on the other indictments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial."", 'So ordered.', '', '. I write separately because our case law on the issue of nexus and probable cause no longer appears to provide useful precedent. This case illustrates that certain assumptions underlying our rescript decision in Commonwealth v. Smith,', '(2003), and thereafter adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v. Pina,', '(2009), and Commonwealth v. Medina,', '(2009), would benefit from reexamination.', '', 'A known drug dealer is observed leaving his residence,', 'Page 269', 'proceeding directly to a controlled buy, and then returning directly home. This does not establish to a certainty that the drugs which were sold under surveillance were retrieved from a supply kept at the residence -- but it provides a rational observer with a reasonable basis to consider it probable.', 'The term ""probable cause"" is not defined in either the Federal Constitution or our Declaration of Rights. Commonwealth v. O\'Day,', ', 300 (2003). ""Probable"" refers to an inference ""that can reasonably be expected or believed on the basis of the available evidence, though not proved or certain."" Webster\'s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 1433 (2d ed. 1983). ""[F]or there to be probable cause, the facts must be such as would warrant a belief by a reasonable man."" Black\'s Law Dictionary 1321 (9th ed. 2009), quoting from LaFave and Israel, Criminal Procedure § 3.3 at 140 (2d ed. 1992).', 'Our task therefore has been, and remains, to apply ""probable"" in a continuum somewhere between possible and certain. The variation in background and circumstances presented by each successive case has resulted in appellate pronouncements relying on ever finer factual distinctions employed to support a particular result for that case; police, prosecutors, defense counsel, magistrates and judges are consequently deprived of useful guidance.', ""Probability does not require the elimination of competing explanations; that would be certainty. In many cases, including this one, the competing explanations to be derived from observed facts are that the defendant kept drugs in a car or on his person, rather than in his home. The existence of these alternatives would not remove a basis to search the defendant's home in my opinion, even if they claimed parity with the probability of drug storage in the home. But they do not: cars and other vehicles"", 'Page 270', ""are less private and less secure than buildings, while keeping drugs on one's person removes the ability to disclaim ownership. However, having denied for legal purposes what a reasonable person"", 'would consider self-evident, we have been required to embark on a search for additional indicia of residential drug storage that are generally less convincing than the round-trip controlled purchase properly surveilled from portal to portal. Not surprisingly, consensus has eluded us.', ""As in this case, reasonable judges can and do differ on the significance of using the same entrance to a building, engaging in activity which looks like a drug transaction but might be something else, registering utilities in one's own name or someone else's, raising the hood of a car on one occasion but not on another, and so forth. Having denied the inference properly drawn from the stronger evidence, we seek to remedy the shortfall with a collection of the weaker. At some point, of course, a large accumulation of facts with weak import may be said to provide a critical mass, but this approach is unsatisfactory in my view and in any event does not often present itself for appellate review."", 'In sum, I believe the majority and dissent reach equally defensible results, depending largely on how one chooses to interpret the mandate for additional ""particularized information"" required by Pina, supra at 442. Under these circumstances, because I consider probable cause to have been demonstrated, I join in the result reached by the majority.', '', '. Respectfully, I dissent because I believe that on the current state of the law, the cases of Commonwealth v. Pina,', '(2009), and Commonwealth v. Medina,', '(2009), control this case. See Part 1, infra.', 'I also dissent because I do not believe that, within the four corners of the search warrant affidavit, a probable cause nexus', 'Page 271', 'to the apartment building in which the defendant lived was established. See Part II, infra. While the affidavit suggests suspicion that heroin may have been stored in the defendant\'s apartment building, a hunch is not enough under the particularized probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. ""In each case, the basic question for the magistrate is whether he has a', 'for concluding that any of the articles described in the warrant are probably in the place to be searched"" (emphasis added). Commonwealth v. Upton,', ', 370 (1985). Here, reduced to essentials, the search warrant affidavit describes four small heroin controlled buys by an informant -- three ""ones"" for forty or sixty dollars, and a ""two"" for $100. All the buys occurred by way of automobile deliveries by the defendant, away from the apartment building.', 'Nothing is set forth in the affidavit that directly ties these four drug sales to the apartment building. Indeed (as further detailed herein), from all that appears in the affidavit, it was two automobiles, an Audi and a Toyota, that presented as most probably ""the place to be searched"" for any stored heroin. Id. at 370. Beyond these inadequacies, the omissions in the affidavit here are telling when compared to the search warrant affidavit that was found to establish probable cause nexus to a residence in Commonwealth v. O\'Day,', '(2003). See Part 2, infra.', 'Turning to the first basis of this dissent, I believe this court is bound to apply the controlling precedent of Pina, supra, and Medina, supra.', 'The Supreme Judicial Court ""is the highest appellate authority in the Commonwealth, and [its] decisions on', 'Page 272', 'all questions of law are conclusive on all Massachusetts trial courts and the Appeals Court."" Commonwealth v. Vasquez,', ', 356 (2010).', 'Here, as in Pina and Medina, there was only one transaction in which the investigators had set up surveillance at the defendant\'s apartment building and saw the defendant drive from the parking lot to the site prearranged with the informant, sell the ""two"" to the informant for $100, and then drive back to the apartment building. In the other three transactions, there was no such point of origin surveillance. Thus, in three of the four deals, it was unknown where the defendant originally came from in order to reach the prearranged site, and the affidavit does not state, nor could it state, that the defendant\'s point of origin before driving to the prearranged site was the apartment building.', '', 'In Pina, 453 Mass. at 442, the Supreme Judicial Court held that ""a single observation of the defendant driving from the apartment to a location where he sold an unspecified quantity of cocaine to the informant"" did not constitute', '""specific allegations, or particularized information based on police surveillance or otherwise, that would permit a reasonable inference that the defendant likely kept a supply of drugs in his apartment.""', 'Furthermore, in Pina -- so too, in this case -- there are no other connective factors that link to the apartment building. That is, like the Pina affidavit, this affidavit did not include ""details about the amount and quantity of drugs the defendant', 'Page 273', 'had sold in the past, or any other facts tending to demonstrate that the defendant sold drugs from his apartment or that he kept a supply of drugs there."" Ibid. Given the foregoing, and following the Pina analysis, the affidavit here -- with only one surveilled round trip from the defendant\'s apartment building parking lot to the prearranged site -- does not demonstrate, by particularized probable cause, a nexus to the apartment building as a place with ""a substantial basis"" to be the location of a supply of heroin.', ""The court's analysis in the Medina case confirms the Pina rejection of one round trip as a predicate for probable cause nexus to a residence. In Medina, 453 Mass. at 1011, the court wrote as follows:"", '""[In the Pina case], we reiterated the principle that evidence establishing that a person may be guilty of illicit drug activity does not necessarily establish probable cause to search that person\'s residence for drugs. . . . The affidavit before us contains the following information linking the defendant\'s drug activity to his apartment: (1) he drove from the apartment to a prearranged location where he sold cocaine to a police informant; and (2) after the sale, he drove back to his apartment. The obvious flaw, as was the case in the Pina and [Commonwealth v. Smith,', '(2003),] decisions, is that the affidavit lacks the requisite nexus between the items to be searched for (drugs and drug paraphernalia) and the place to be searched (the defendant\'s apartment) to constitute probable cause to search.""', ""In sum, in this case, when one applies the analysis that one round-trip surveillance of a drug sale is insufficient, see Pina, supra, and Medina, supra, as this court is bound to do, there are only blanks, not connective dots, in the affidavit, leaving no probable cause nexus between the apartment building and the defendant's four small sales of heroin in offsite car transactions. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority holding in light of the Pina-Medina precedent."", '2.  Second, I dissent because, even apart from the Pina-Medina precedent, I am not persuaded that, within the four corners of', 'Page 274', 'the affidavit, the constitutional standard of particularized probable cause was met. ""[T]he sufficiency of the search warrant application always begins and ends with the \'four corners of the affidavit.\' "" Commonwealth v. O\'Day, 440 Mass. at 297, quoting from Commonwealth v. Villella,', ', 428 (1995). ""The right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one\'s privacy. It was just this sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amendment was designed to circumscribe by the general requirement of a judicial determination of probable cause."" Commonwealth v. Forde,', ', 805 (1975). Accordingly, where the place to be searched is a residence, the affidavit must include specific information and reasonable inferences a magistrate may draw to provide ""a sufficient nexus between the defendant\'s drug-selling activity and his residence to establish probable cause to search the residence."" Commonwealth v. O\'Day, 440 Mass. at 304. That nexus is not established here.', ""To the contrary, if one looks within the four corners of this affidavit, there is only a broken line that cannot connect probable cause to the apartment building. (Compare the O'Day case, discussed infra.) In this case, there is no indication that the informant ever saw drugs in the defendant's apartment building. There is no surveillance indicating that drugs were sold by the defendant from within the apartment building. There is no indication that the defendant was within the apartment when the sales were set up by the informant's telephone calls. There is no indication that the defendant ever carried anything from the apartment building. And as previously noted, there is nothing in the affidavit about the defendant leaving the apartment building prior to three of the four controlled buys. Indeed, the only round-trip surveillance refers to the defendant driving from the parking lot"", '-- it appears that the police did not see the defendant leave the building, and did not see his actions with respect', 'Page 275', 'to the Audi and Toyota cars before he left the parking lot -- a point of import, to which I now turn.', ""From all that appears in the affidavit, it was more probable that the heroin was stored in the interchangeable Audi and Toyota cars, which the defendant drove to the prearranged heroin dealing sites. On that point, I note that in two separate surveillances (not part of the four controlled sales to the informant), the police observed the defendant engaging in unusual activity that indicated he was placing something into or moving something around between the Audi and the Toyota. During one such surveillance conducted on April 1, 2005, detectives observed the defendant, accompanied by an unidentified heavyset Hispanic man, exit the rear of the apartment building, and enter the green Audi. The defendant drove in an evasive manner. The Audi was met by an unidentified man and woman. The woman entered the Audi, and after a short ride, was dropped off. Upon return to the apartment building parking lot, the defendant exited the Audi, walked over to the Toyota, and looked about to see if he were being watched. The defendant entered the Toyota, and opened the engine hood. Again, the defendant looked around to see if he were being watched. The defendant either placed something in, or took something out of, the Toyota engine compartment. Then, the defendant moved the Toyota to a spot that blocked the Audi. In another such surveillance, on April 4, 2005, the police observed the defendant exit the rear of the apartment building and walk directly to the Audi, which he opened with a key. The defendant drove the Audi to meet with an unidentified female, who entered the Audi, and was dropped off after a short ride. When he returned to the apartment parking lot, the defendant again exited the Audi, and used another key to unlock the Toyota. The defendant went into the Toyota's interior for a brief time."", '', 'Further indicating that the defendant used the two cars as', 'Page 276', ""tools of his trade, the defendant masked his connection to the two cars. The Audi was registered in the defendant's girlfriend's name and the Toyota was registered to another individual, who had a heroin distribution criminal record. This pattern suggests that the two cars were being used not only to transport, but also to store, heroin. It is reasonable to infer that the defendant engaged in a shell game of driving one car to the prearranged site, while using the other car as a storage location, and then alternating the cases and the cars' purposes. There were far more probable cause connections to the cars, as described in the affidavit, than in the scant descriptions associated with the apartment building."", ""The majority looks to Commonwealth v. O'Day,"", "", as support for a probable cause nexus to the apartment building. In my opinion, the O'Day case tends to demonstrate no such probable cause. In O'Day, the only significant affidavit information similar to this case is that there were three controlled buys by an informant. But, in most other material respects, the O'Day case is markedly different because the O'Day search warrant affidavit had many more links to the residence than are present in this case."", 'Most significantly, in the O\'Day case, the Supreme Judicial Court cited two police surveillances indicating sales from within O\'Day\'s residence as establishing probable cause that controlled substances were stored in that residence. In one police surveillance of O\'Day\'s residence, the officers saw a number of visitors arrive and depart after a very brief stay. Commonwealth v. O\'Day, supra at 299. Given the quick visits by this series of individuals to O\'Day\'s residence, the affidavit included a police officer\'s expert opinion that the behavior was ""consistent with narcotics distribution."" Ibid. A second police surveillance of O\'Day\'s residence confirmed ""the same pattern of visitors to the defendant\'s residence as on the previous occasion: \'several vehicles that arrived and departed . . . after a brief stay.\' "" Id. at 300.', ""this parade of visitors briefly entering and exiting O'Day's residence that the Supreme Judicial Court found critical"", 'Page 277', 'in the probable cause calculus of nexus to the residence.', 'the informant\'s three controlled buys from O\'Day away from O\'Day\'s residence that established the connection. To that end, the court made clear in O\'Day that ""the details provided by the confidential informant, standing alone, did not establish a nexus between [O\'Day\'s] drug activity and his residence, [it was rather] the additional information gathered by the State troopers during their surveillance and investigation [that] established probable cause"" (emphasis added). Id. at 302. In contrast, in this case, virtually all of the argument for nexus to the apartment rests on the four controlled buys away from the apartment building.', 'In further contrast to the O\'Day case, here, there was no information in the affidavit that the defendant was using the apartment to sell drugs to random and brief visitors. Nor did the affidavit contain corroborative investigative information linking the residence to illegal conduct, such as was set forth in the O\'Day affidavit. To illustrate the major differences: as set forth in the O\'Day affidavit (beyond the sales at the residence already described), the investigation also revealed a series of sales by O\'Day to a number of buyers at the pub where he worked. In this respect, the O\'Day affidavit refers to one pub surveillance where there were ""a series of exchanges beneath a table in the bar [between O\'Day and] several individuals."" Id. at 229. In another surveillance at the pub, there were several police observations of potential buyers going into the men\'s room with O\'Day for a short period of time, as if a deal had just occurred. Id. at 300. Given all of this additional information -- beyond the three controlled buys to the informant -- the Supreme Judicial Court in O\'Day concluded that the number of transactions and quantity of drugs being sold on divers dates by the O\'Day enterprise gave rise to probable cause that cocaine was stored at O\'Day\'s residence. Specifically, the O\'Day court wrote as follows:', '""During two surveillances, the defendant was observed departing from his residence in his truck, proceeding directly to [the pub], and engaging therein in what appeared to be drug transactions. The reasonable inference was that the defendant brought a substantial quantity of', 'Page 278', 'drugs with him to the pub. It was unlikely that the defendant obtained the drugs from within the bar, as the defendant argues, or from any other location because he was constantly watched by the officers. It appeared that the drugs were transported in the truck, to which he returned to replenish his supply.', '(emphasis added).', 'Id. at 303.\n\n        None of this is present in the affidavit in this case. Unlike the O\'Day case, there are no sales by the defendant other than the four controlled buys. There is not, in this case, a large number of buys or substantial drug sales. There is no evidence of a large-scale drug enterprise. Rather, what the search warrant affidavit devolves to is four ""small time"" controlled buys by an informant: (1) a buy of ""one"" for forty dollars on March 28, 2005; (2) a buy of ""one"" for sixty dollars on March 29, 2005; (3) a buy of ""two"" for $100 on April 4, 2005; and (4) a buy of ""one"" for sixty dollars on April 8, 2005. (As previously referenced, see note 1, supra, these four controlled buys were not a part of the trial, and not the basis for any of the defendant\'s convictions.)', ""Because the trial was based on the heroin, cocaine, and guns and ammunition seized under the warrant, and not the controlled buys by the informant, it is true that allowance of the defendant's motion to suppress on the basis that the search warrant affidavit did not establish probable cause nexus to the apartment building means that a man who had a large cache of heroin (30.96 grams), a smaller, but not insignificant, amount of cocaine, and handguns will have his convictions vacated."", 'That is troubling, especially since had there been more targeted law', 'Page 279', ""enforcement surveillance -- such as establishing a surveillance point at the apartment building prior to the four controlled buys, watching the defendant's activities on more occasions than was done here, and undertaking additional, corroborative investigative work in this case -- gaps would have been filled, and a probable cause nexus may very well have been built into the search warrant affidavit with connections to the defendant's apartment building. But courts must not fill in probable cause blanks. Thus, although this dissent would lead to an untoward end in that a large amount of drugs and guns would be suppressed under the exclusionary rule, in the final judicial analysis, I set the lodestar for this dissent in the words that resonate with fundamental constitutional power in the Fourth Amendment"", 'and art. 14.', '""[C]onviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions . . . should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts . . . .

On April 20, 2007, a Lowell police officer applied for four search warrants, one each for a residence on Angle Street in Lowell, a residence on Lantern Lane in Billerica, and two vehicles registered to the defendant. The warrants issued, and police officers executed them on April 21, 2007. Read as a whole, Commonwealth v. Donahue,', ', 715 (2000), the single affidavit supporting the application for the four warrants narrates the following.', ""The Lowell police department investigated the defendant's drug-selling activity throughout March and April of 2007. A confidential informant"", 'provided information about illicit oxycodone sales by the defendant from a residence on Angle Street in Lowell. Sometime after April 13, 2007, the confidential informant, at the request of the Lowell police officer, conducted a controlled purchase of oxycodone from the defendant at the Angle Street residence. The controlled purchase took place as planned, leading to the identification of the defendant, his automobile, and his telephone number.', 'The Lowell police also obtained information by liaising with the Billerica police department. The Billerica police had received information from a second, unnamed confidential informant', 'that the defendant distributed oxycodone using removable magnetized containers hidden under the hood of his vehicle. Based on this information, the Billerica police began surveilling an address on Talbot Avenue in Billerica during December, 2006. On one occasion, a police detective observed the defendant arrive at the Talbot Avenue address and remove a container from under the hood of his vehicle. Although the detective stated that the defendant\'s ""body language was consistent with', 'Page 292', 'that of a person secreting or removing an item(s) from under the hood of the vehicle,"" there was no evidence as to the contents of the container.', 'The Billerica police subsequently received information from a third confidential informant', 'on March 1, 2007. This informant, ""Wizard,"" provided the Billerica police with the defendant\'s address on Lantern Lane in Billerica. Wizard also described the defendant\'s drug-selling operations from the Lantern Lane address, stating that customers come to the address during the morning hours while the defendant makes deliveries of oxycodone later in the day. Finally, Wizard corroborated the defendant\'s method of using containers under the hood of his vehicle to hide narcotics.', ""Upon request by the Lowell police officer, the Registry of Motor Vehicles (registry) verified that the vehicle observed as the defendant's at the Angle Street address was registered to the defendant at the Lantern Lane address. Registry files also identified another vehicle registered to the defendant at that address."", ""Finally, the affiant recited his training and experience during his eight years as a Lowell police officer and, on this basis, the affiant identified certain common practices employed by individuals involved in the drug trade, including separation of narcotics from proceeds and records by storage at different locations. Based on his understanding of these practices, the affiant stated his belief that he would find proceeds and records from the defendant's drug-selling activity in the Lantern Lane residence. The affiant did not seek to search the Lantern Lane residence for oxycodone or any other drugs."", 'The warrants then issued for both addresses and both vehicles. On April 21, 2007, the Lowell police executed two warrants at the Angle Street address (one was for one of the vehicles), and', 'Page 293', 'the Billerica police executed the remaining two warrants at the Lantern Lane address (again, one was for a vehicle).', 'At Angle Street, the Lowell police encountered the defendant and secured him after he appeared to attempt to ingest narcotics. The defendant had on his person a hollow lip balm container with nine oxycodone tablets inside. The subsequent search of the home yielded an additional eighty-four tablets of oxycodone, eighty-six tablets of morphine, small amounts of suboxone (buprenorphine) and methadone, and $1,149 in cash.', ""At Lantern Lane, the Billerica police found a safe hidden in the floor of the defendant's bedroom closet. A search of the safe uncovered evidence of narcotics trafficking, including paper records, a device for detecting counterfeit currency, and approximately $23,000 in cash in bundles of $1,000 each. Elsewhere in the house, the police found additional money and five cellular telephones. Five tablets of suboxone were in the safe and the bedroom, but the police found no other narcotics. A firearm also was discovered."", 'The defendant was charged with trafficking in oxycodone (over fourteen grams), G. L. c. 94C, § 32E(c)(1); possession of oxycodone with intent to distribute, G.

L. c. 94C, § 34; and improper storage of a firearm, G. L. c. 140, § 131L(a)-(b). He pleaded guilty to the firearm charge and was tried on the narcotics charges.', ""Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence recovered from the Lantern Lane address based on inadequacies in the search warrant affidavit.

In contrast, the affidavit here included no reference to even one direct observation, either by police officers or confidential informants, of the defendant entering or leaving the Lantern Lane residence before or after a drug transaction or before or after secretly accessing the engine compartment of one of his vehicles. The affiant, therefore, recited no pattern of activity at the Lantern Lane residence similar to the pattern held sufficient to establish probable cause in Escalera.', 'Additionally, the lapse of time between the Billerica police\'s receipt of Wizard\'s information and the application for the search warrant, more than seven weeks, ""raises further concerns."" Pina, 453 Mass. at 442 (three-day lapse between observation', 'Page 297', 'and warrant application raises concerns). Although the affiant described activity demonstrating continuous drug-selling operations involving the Angle Street residence and the two vehicles, see Commonwealth v.

Latimore,', ', 677-678 (1979). Commonwealth v. Dagraca,', ', 555 (2006). Factors bearing on the tainted evidence\'s contribution to the jury\'s verdicts include ""the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\'s case; the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; who introduced the issue at trial; the frequency of the reference; whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence; the availability or effect of curative instructions; and the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt."" Id. at 553.', ""Here, the defendant contested the trafficking and possession of narcotics with intent to distribute charges by claiming that he possessed large quantities of narcotics for personal use due to his oxycodone addiction. The defendant presented evidence that a person addicted to oxycodone could consume up to nine pills in one day, making the quantity recovered from the defendant's possession only about one week's supply for a person sufficiently addicted. The defendant also presented evidence that the defendant's possession of suboxone and methadone, substances used to treat the symptoms of withdrawal from opiates such as oxycodone, corroborated his defense as consistent with attempted treatment for an oxycodone addiction."", ""In light of the defendant's theory, the evidence recovered from the Lantern Lane residence powerfully undermined the premise of the defense. Indeed, the Commonwealth highlighted this evidence by calling Louis Cherubino, a Cambridge police detective not involved with this investigation or prosecution, as an expert witness to testify about the consistency of the evidence against the defendant with standard drug-selling practices."", 'Cherubino testified that the evidence found at the Lantern Lane residence ""definitively"" affected his opinion that the defendant intended to distribute the narcotics found in his possession. Moreover, Cherubino testified that the packaging of the money, in bundles of $1,000, was ""more consistent with distribution than just simple possession."" Cherubino testified similarly about the recovery of the magnetized container and the presence of a safe containing this evidence at the Lantern Lane residence.', 'Page 299', ""Finally, the prosecutor highlighted Cherubino's testimony in closing argument. She cited his testimony about the packaging of the money found at the Lantern Lane residence, in $1,000 bundles, as consistent with the defendant's involvement in the narcotics business. She further argued that the large cash sum and the defendant's maintenance of two residences was much more consistent with a seller of narcotics than a person addicted to them."", 'Because the Commonwealth introduced the evidence seized from the Lantern Lane residence and highlighted it with expert testimony and in closing argument, and because the evidence strongly contradicted the premise of the defense, we must conclude that it was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', '4. Conclusion. The judgments on the trafficking, possession with intent to distribute, and school zone violation indictments are vacated and the verdicts set aside. Because there was ample evidence of the lesser included offenses of simple possession of oxycodone, morphine, and suboxone found in the Angle Street residence, the Commonwealth, on remand, may move for sentencing on these lesser included offenses or seek to retry the defendant on the trafficking, possession with intent to distribute, and school zone violation indictments. See Commonwealth v. Kastner,', ', 141 (2010); Commonwealth v. Montalvo,', ', 331-332 (2010). The judgment on the indictment charging the defendant with possession of suboxone found in the Lantern Lane residence is vacated, the verdict set aside, and a new judgment is to enter dismissing that indictment. The judgment on the other indictment charging the defendant with possession of suboxone is affirmed. The matter is remanded to Superior Court for further consistent proceedings.', 'So ordered.']"

Our conclusion in this regard was expressly based on our understanding of Commonwealth v.

To the contrary, Narcisse reaffirmed the result reached in Fraser but clarified the proper analysis to use when confronted with the type of encounter as that in Frasier. Ibid. Specifically, after laying out how an individual\'s conduct could simultaneously create a reasonable suspicion both that criminal activity was afoot and that a suspect was armed and dangerous, the court stated the following:', '""The Fraser case fits within this analysis. Having responded to a scene where they reasonably believed a gun was likely to be present, the police officers could fairly interpret the defendant\'s furtive conduct of bending down as though picking up something, followed by his refusal to remove his hands from his pockets, as evidence that the defendant had armed himself and was about to undertake some action against them with a weapon. These circumstances justified the escalation of the encounter.""', 'Narcisse, 457 Mass. at 10. With this as a backdrop, we turn to the question whether the police here had the requisite reasonable suspicion to conduct a protective frisk of the defendant at the time they did so.', '', 'Page 370', 'We begin by examining the information on which the police originally relied, the overheard dispatch call. There was no information about who provided the tip on which the call was based, or under what circumstances the information was relayed. Thus, ""we do not know and cannot learn who called, and cannot discern the motive or state of mind of the caller."" Mubdi, 456 Mass. at 397. While acknowledging that the dispatch call did not identify the tipster (and that therefore the source would have to be treated as anonymous), the motion judge nevertheless concluded that the tip ""so accurately described [the defendant] that I find it to reflect a reliable basis of knowledge on the part of the informant."" As set forth below, this analysis is inconsistent with the case law.', 'It is certainly true that under some circumstances, ""the reliability of an anonymous caller may be demonstrated by police corroboration of the information provided."" Ibid., citing Commonwealth v. Alvarado,', ', 271-272 (1996). However, the case law establishes a distinction between corroboration of details regarding the identity of the person whom the tipster has accused and corroboration of information about concealed criminal activity. As the United States Supreme Court has emphasized, ""The reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person."" Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 272 (2000). Thus, an anonymous tip that someone has a gun -- regardless of how detailed it may be in identifying the person being accused -- is not ""without more, sufficient to justify a police officer\'s stop and frisk of that person."" Id. at 268.', '', 'The Supreme Judicial Court has also emphasized that police corroboration of the identity and location of the person whom an anonymous tipster has accused, by itself, has limited value. See Mubdi, supra. In that case, the police had received an anonymous tip regarding a reported gun transaction involving two black males in a specifically identified car. In following up on the tip, ""the police confirmed that the caller was accurate in describing the location of the vehicle and the number of men', 'Page 371', 'inside."" The court held that this was insufficient given that all the police were able to confirm were ""innocent facts, all of which could have been observed by anyone at or around the location of the automobile.""

Id. at 397-398, citing Commonwealth v. Bakoian,', ', 302 (1992); Commonwealth v. Lyons,', ', 22 (1990). In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court has highlighted that ""[c]arrying a gun is not a crime. Carrying a firearm without a license (or other authorization) is."" Alvarado, supra at 269. For all of these reasons, it is now well established that ""[a]n anonymous tip that someone is carrying a gun does not, without more, constitute reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop and frisk of that individual"" (footnote omitted). Commonwealth v. Barros,', ', 177 (2001).', 'Accordingly, there can be little doubt that the dispatch call that the police officers overheard could not alone provide them reasonable suspicion sufficient to seize the defendant.', 'However, the police did not seize the defendant based on the dispatch call alone. Instead, they seized him only after having observed him during their on street encounter. The question we face is whether those observations, in combination with the information they had received from the anonymous tip, provided them with the requisite reasonable suspicion.', 'Although we find this question close, we conclude that it does.', 'While the anonymous tip alone did not provide the police', 'Page 372', 'with reasonable suspicion to seize the defendant, it provided them ample authority to approach him and to conduct what the Supreme Judicial Court recently termed a ""field interrogation observation."" See Narcisse, 457 Mass. at 3. Indeed, as the court said in Fraser, in an observation that remains valid today, ""it would have been poor police work"" not to investigate a report of an armed man. 410 Mass. 544  at n.4. See Commonwealth v. Stoute,', ', 790 (1996) (""When a tip . . . concerns the possession of a firearm, it deserves the immediate attention of law enforcement officials""). Having validly approached the defendant with some basis for believing that he in particular was armed,', 'the police made a judgment that they could not let the defendant have easy access to the specific location where the gun was alleged to be. We believe that it was reasonable for the police to make that judgment even though the action that the defendant started to take, removing his backpack, could also be interpreted as an innocent gesture (or as a predicate to fleeing).', '', ""Our analysis draws support from Fraser, as reinterpreted in Narcisse. That is, the facts here are broadly similar to those in Fraser, and we think that they provide a comparable level of support for the actions the police took. The defendant's taking off his backpack could perhaps be seen as less threatening than what the defendant had done in Fraser (bending down as though picking up something, followed by his refusal to remove his hands from his pockets). However, the police here had a significantly stronger basis for believing that the defendant was armed."", 'See Commonwealth v.

While admission of the certificates was error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the defendant contends that the motion judge (who was not the trial judge) erred in denying the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the execution of a search warrant. On our review of the warrant application, there was probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant for this location, and we affirm the judge's decision to deny the motion. Therefore, we affirm the convictions."", 'Background.', 'At about 2:45 P.M. on August 25, 2006, members of the Everett police department (including Detectives Kelley and Connor) arrived at the basement door at 9 Belmont Street in Everett to execute a search warrant. After the officers knocked on the door to the basement, the defendant answered it and the officers entered. One of the officers explained to the defendant that the officers were there to execute a search warrant. The defendant ""was fine; he was cooperative."" The officers explained the warrant and read the defendant his Miranda rights.', 'The defendant asked the officers not to ransack his apartment and agreed to give the police the items he thought they were looking for, whereupon he began to retrieve a number of Ziploc bags containing different substances and handed them to Detective Kelley. First, he retrieved a Ziploc bag from a kitchen cabinet that contained a ""green leafy substance,"" which Detective Kelley ""believed to be marijuana."" The defendant then retrieved a second Ziploc bag of marijuana from a kitchen drawer. Next, the defendant retrieved what Kelley said were ""three bags of cocaine, and then two additional bags with pills"" from a small vest on the couch. One of the bags had seventy-two pills, and the other had thirty-eight pills.', 'Page 419', 'The officers searched for additional drugs. Detective Connor found two small bags of a ""white powdery substance"" that he believed to be cocaine and a ""small bag of a green leafy substance"" he believed to be marijuana in the top drawer of a bureau next to the bed. In the third drawer down from the top of the same bureau he also located a bag of ten blue Percocet pills. These blue pills, which were admitted in evidence, had the word ""PERCOCET"" stamped on them on one side. In the same drawer, he found fifteen white Percocet pills. Detective Connor also located two bags of white Percocets in a drawer inside the stove, one bag containing 179 pills and the other containing eighty-eight pills. At the coffee table, Detective Connor discovered another ""small bag of green leafy substance,"" which he believed at the time to be marijuana.', ""Sergeant Durant found ten orange suboxone pills during the search and gave them to Detective Kelley. Based on Detective Kelley's training and experience, he recognized buprenorphine as another name for suboxone. During the search, Detective Kelley also received marijuana from both Sergeant Durant and Sergeant O'Malley. Officers also seized several additional bags containing various substances."", ""At trial, a certificate of drug analysis was entered in evidence with each controlled substance and identified by Detective Kelley. The defendant turned over $286 during the search to Detective Kelley, which was entered in evidence. There was no drug paraphernalia found in the apartment other than the above evidence. The Commonwealth's police witnesses conceded on cross-examination the lack of evidence indicative of drug distribution, such as scales, dilutant, grinders, baggies or packaging materials, ledgers, safe or other security items, and weapons."", 'The defense was that the seized drugs were for personal use, not distribution. In support of this defense, the defendant testified to a lengthy history of drug use, dating from about 1990, when he got run over by a truck; as a result of his injuries, he was prescribed and began taking Percocet. Thereafter and for the interceding twenty years, the defendant was given Percocet pills, other than by prescription, by others, including coworkers and work customers and testified to using up to thirty Percocets a day.', 'Page 420', 'The defendant admitted to keeping Percocet ""[a]ll over"" his apartment, keeping Percocet pills in his pocket at work, and hiding his ""per[c]s"" from most people. He testified that he was taking them ""constantly,"" having to ""eat five, ten at times,"" to get out of bed in the morning, taking another twenty Percocets in the afternoon and night. The defendant introduced three medical records in evidence to demonstrate his Percocet addiction.', 'When asked why some of the pills were blue and some white, the defendant explained, ""That\'s just how they come."" He continued, ""I just know -- \'Percs\' -- I look at the thing, and if it says \'Perc\' on it, or something."" He added, ""I don\'t care about the color, as long as they\'re \'Percs.\' "" When asked if he kept Percocets in his stove, the defendant said, ""Yes."" He also confirmed that he had one bag containing 179 Percocets and another bag containing approximately eighty-eight Percocets. He also stated that along with taking six to seven Percocets in the morning before he got out of bed, ""instead of coffee [he\'d] have a joint.""', 'Regarding the cocaine, the defendant testified on direct examination that he used cocaine once a year at an annual party on Labor Day weekend. According to the defendant, he had purchased the supposed cocaine found in his apartment from a ""kid from Chelsea"" but had never used any of the three bags he had recently purchased (and was unclear whether he had used any of the alleged cocaine contained in two smaller bags discovered by the police). The defendant saved up ""all year long"" for cocaine and then obtained it from ""a friend of [his] that [he] know[s] very well."" The defendant received a discount because the ""kid is a pretty good friend of [his],"" and the defendant ""did it once a year with him for years."" The defendant stated that the other two bags found in his apartment were from the previous year when he ""went and did the same thing."" The defendant stated that he ""[d]idn\'t look and see what it was. Didn\'t know anything,"" when he purchased the cocaine. Then, in response to the question whether there were three bags of cocaine that he delivered to the police, he responded, ""That was, yes."" On cross-examination, the defendant confirmed that he was ""caught with"" ""three eight balls"" of cocaine, and when asked if he saw the ""bags of cocaine introduced in evidence,"" the defendant responded, ""Yes.""', 'Page 421', 'The defendant was also indicted for possession of buprenorphine. Detective Kelley testified that he recognized buprenorphine as another name for suboxone. The defendant said his friend gave him the suboxone pills to help him combat his opiate addiction because the defendant was taking thirty ""Percs"" a day. The defendant ""knew what they were"" and had never taken any but was saving them ""until [he] was ready.""', 'Discussion. Certificates of drug analysis. The United States Supreme Court has held that the admission of the certificate from the forensic chemist without an opportunity for cross-examination is error. See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009). The defendant is entitled to a review under harmless error principles. Commonwealth v. Vasquez,', ', 355-360 (2010). In determining whether the error was harmless, we ask ""whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction."" Commonwealth v. Perez,', ', 260 (1991), quoting from Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).', 'In making an assessment of harmless/harmful error, the court must consider whether, ""on the totality of the record before [it], weighing the properly and improperly admitted evidence together, [the court is] satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the [certificates] did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury\'s verdicts."" Commonwealth v. Tyree,', ', 701 (2010). ""[A] number of factors [may be examined], including the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\'s case, the frequency of reference to the evidence, whether it was cumulative of other evidence, and whether the other evidence against the defendant was overwhelming."" Commonwealth v. Pimentel,', ', 238 (2010), quoting from Commonwealth v. Rosario,', ', 511 (1999). Also considered is ""the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense."" Ibid., quoting from Commonwealth v. Mahdi,', ', 696-697 (1983).', 'The defendant contends that there was inadequate evidence, independent from the certificates of chemical analysis, showing the nature of the substances for which he was charged and that his testimony ought not to be considered on this issue. As to this latter point, he contends that the harmless error analysis', 'Page 422', 'should not give much weight to his testimony because he did not stipulate to the nature of the substances seized by police. See Melendez-Diaz, supra at 2542 (defendant ""will often stipulate to the nature of the substance in the ordinary drug case""); Commonwealth v. Muniz,', ', 173 n.7 (2010); Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 456 Mass. at 355 (""The defendant, however, did not stipulate that the substances were cocaine""); Commonwealth v. Charles,', ', 383 (2010) (rejecting the Commonwealth\'s argument that reversal is not required where the nature of the substances was not a "" \'live issue\' at trial"" because ""the defendant \'tacitly stipulated\' to the nature of the substances"" when defense counsel referred ""to the substances as \'drugs\' in his opening statement,"" and when ""in questioning witnesses and in his summation, [counsel] referred to the substances as \'marijuana\' and \'crack cocaine,\' "" and when counsel ""encouraged the jury to return verdicts of guilty on the lesser included offenses of simple possession""); Commonwealth v. Rivera,', ', 71-72 (2009). The defendant also argues that his testimony did not waive his confrontation rights that he had preserved by objection because he was compelled to present the personal use defense in light of the statutorily permitted and virtually certain introduction of the certificates. We disagree.', 'As to the nature of the substances, we have recognized that ""it would be a rare case in which a witness\'s statement that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction."" Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 263 (2010), quoting from Commonwealth v. Dawson,', ', 467 (1987). It is also ""settled that scientific analysis is not the only method to prove the nature of a substance, and that a properly qualified police officer may provide opinion testimony that a substance is a particular controlled substance."" Ibid. Had the evidence in this case consisted only of the testimony of police officers who ""believed"" that the substances were Percocet, cocaine, marijuana, and suboxone, and considering the authorities upon which he relies, there would be force to the defendant\'s arguments. Here, however, powerful evidence of the nature of the substances was introduced, consisting of admissions made by the defendant during the search by police and during his trial testimony.', 'Page 423', 'Competent evidence of the nature of a controlled substance can come from drug users, such as a defendant. Furthermore, ""a witness need not have used the substance on the occasion in question in order to testify as to its nature. It is enough that the witness have familiarity based on prior use or sale. . . . \'Identification based on past use coupled with present observation of the substance at hand will suffice to establish the illicit nature of a suspected substance.\' "" Commonwealth v. Cantres,', ', 246-247 (1989), quoting from United States v. Harrell, 737 F.2d 971, 978-979 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1164, and 470 U.S. 1027 (1985). See Commonwealth v. Villatoro,', ', 652-654 (2010) (judge entitled to infer that defendant in that case, who testified to long history of marijuana use, was able to identify marijuana and competent to testify on subject).', 'Here, the defendant\'s statements and actions during the search of his residence were, at the least, implicit admissions that the substances in question were, in fact, cocaine, Percocet, and marijuana. The Commonwealth introduced evidence during its case-in-chief that police officers explained the search warrant to the defendant. The defendant told them he would hand over ""what they were looking for"" in return for the police not ransacking his residence; he then proceeded to retrieve Ziploc bags from the kitchen containing marijuana, cocaine, and multiple bags of Percocet containing approximately thirty to seventy pills in each bag. The officers also located other items that they believed to be Percocet pills, cocaine, marijuana, and buprenorphine. In Commonwealth v. DeMatos,', ', 732 (2010), the Commonwealth introduced admissions from the defendant that he was ""a substantial user of cocaine, . . . that he was using cocaine in his apartment at the time the police arrived, and [that] when shown the drugs found in the apartment, [he] acknowledged that he had forgotten that cocaine was there."" The court concluded that ""the evidence that the composition of the drugs in the apartment was cocaine was so powerful that the certificates had little or no effect on the verdicts."" Ibid.', 'In addition, consistent with the opening statement of his attorney at the beginning of the trial,', 'the defendant gave extensive', 'Page 424', 'testimony during which he identified the substances found in his possession and described a long history of use of the substances in question. He admitted that he had been addicted to Percocet for many years, dating from a work-related accident in 1990, and that he consumed up to thirty pills per day; additionally, he admitted frequent and long-standing use of marijuana and annual purchase and consumption of cocaine. Then, during the prosecutor\'s cross-examination of the defendant, following up on the Commonwealth\'s evidence of the manner in which the defendant retrieved and turned over bags of drugs, he identified the bags containing in excess of 100 pills as Percocets, and admitted that he had secreted Percocets all over his house, including in his stove, and that he knew Percocets. Moreover, he admitted being ""caught with"" ""three eight balls"" of cocaine.', 'This testimony is significantly similar to that given in Commonwealth v. Villatoro, 76 Mass. App. Ct. at 652-654, wherein the defendant ""not only admitted that the substance in question was marijuana, he testified at length on the subject, asserting the distinction between different grades of \'weed,\' explaining why he also had smoking implements and baggies on his person, and detailing his experience and long history of marijuana use."" Moreover, as in Villatoro, and unlike the recent case of Commonwealth v. Mendes,', "", 478-482 (2010), further appellate review granted, 459 Mass. 1104  (2011), the defendant's testimony was directed toward the nature of the substances for which he was charged."", '', 'Page 425', 'Unlike Mendes, supra, we have no doubt here that the defendant was not motivated to testify because of the admission of the certificates of drug analysis. Rather, we are confident that he testified because he needed to explain the large number of Percocet pills that the police seized, including many handed over by the defendant himself. Unless he testified, any justification for his possession of the drugs for his personal use, especially due to his Percocet addiction, would have been unknown to the jury. Moreover, we can discount the possibility that admission of the certificates provided any motivation for the defendant to testify as he would have been aware of the evidentiary impact of his own admissions to the police during the search. Contrast Mendes, supra at 476 (one defendant made no admissions during the execution of the search warrant, and the other only admitted to "" \'some trees\' -- street slang for marijuana""). Moreover, unlike the currency that should have been suppressed in Commonwealth v. Charros,', "", 765-767, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 870 (2005), the controlled substances here are not being suppressed; the issue is the quantity and quality of evidence of the nature of the substances apart from the certificates. In our view, because the defendant's testimony explained his possession of the drugs for which he was charged and his familiarity with the drugs at issue, and because he admitted the nature of the substances found by police, this case is different from Commonwealth v. Mendes, supra, and is instead controlled in significant measure by Villatoro, supra, and DeMatos, 77 Mass. App. Ct. at 730-732."", ""We acknowledge that in analyzing for harmless error, a defendant's failure to contest the nature of the substance should not be considered as controlling. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 456 Mass. at 355 (defendant's theory of defense, as explained by trial counsel's summation, was mistaken identity). We believe that there is a significant difference between a situation where"", 'Page 426', 'the defendant does not contest the nature of a substance and one where the defendant admits to the police the nature of a substance, confirms it during his testimony, and advances the theory of personal use by more than cross-examination and final argument. Here, that theory, which was announced in his attorney\'s opening statement, was powerfully advanced by his own testimony and finally summarized by his attorney in the closing statement: ""the Commonwealth has failed to meet their burden with respect to one and one element alone, and that is that there is no intent to distribute by [the defendant].""', '', 'We are thus convinced that the certificates\' admission in evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Commonwealth showed that other properly admitted ""evidence of guilt was \'overwhelming\' in the sense that it was so powerful as to \'nullify any effect\' "" that the improperly admitted evidence ""might have had on the jury or the verdict."" Commonwealth v. Tyree, 455 Mass. at 704 n.44, quoting from Commonwealth v. Dagraca,', ', 555 (2006). See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, supra at 363. Thus, reversal is not required.', 'Search warrant. The affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant from Everett police Detective Kelley provided the magistrate with information that an Everett police officer living next door to 9 Belmont Street had observed frequent foot traffic coming and going from the basement apartment of 9 Belmont Street. In the span of a few hours, the officer ""notic[ed] the occupant [of 9 Belmont Street] [i.e., the defendant] would come out of the house talking on a [cellular telephone] several times."" Detective Kelley corroborated these observations on August 8 and 9, 2006, witnessing a number of people make short visits to 9 Belmont Street. Prior to the visits, the defendant was seen in front of 9 Belmont Street looking around and talking on a cellular telephone. In addition, the affidavit reported that a confidential informant known to Kelley and dubbed ""Spider"" told Kelley that the defendant was distributing Percocet out of 9 Belmont Street, that he had purchased Percocet from the defendant in the past, and that he ""ha[d] seen over 100 pills in [the defendant\'s] possession wrapped in a paper towel or in a zip', 'Page 427', 'lock freezer bag.""

In particular, the defendant contends that sufficient evidence of a nexus was lacking because the warrant affidavit does not contain any description of the interior of 9 Belmont Street, including how many units are in the building, nor does it contain any ""description of the means of access or egress between the units in the building."" Likewise, the affidavit does not contain any description of Spider\'s supposed activities inside 9 Belmont Street, i.e., where he went, what he did, or who (if anyone) he met with while inside the building, nor does it contain any allegation that Spider ever saw Percocets (or any other controlled substance) inside the defendant\'s basement apartment.', '', 'Page 428', '""Our inquiry into the sufficiency of a search warrant application always begins and ends with the \'four corners of the affidavit.\' "" Commonwealth v.

See Commonwealth v.Gallagher,', ', 59 (2007).', ""While the search warrant affidavit was not a model of detail and clarity, as a whole it provides sufficient evidence that there was a nexus between the drug transactions and the basement apartment at 9 Belmont Street. See Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 300-305. The affidavit reported that there were three controlled purchases, all of which the informant set up by calling a specified number. On all three occasions, the informant was told to go to the basement apartment. While the affiant"", 'Page 429', 'could not constantly watch the informant after he entered the building, the affiant states that he saw the informant go in and leave by the basement door.', ""In addition, the defendant argues that there was no conclusive evidence that the drug transactions occurred within the target apartment. However, the fact that neither the informant's statement nor police observations established that the drug transactions occurred within the apartment does not alter the probable cause analysis.

While the affidavit did not negate the possibility that the purchases occurred somewhere inside the building and not necessarily within the apartment, it is reasonable to conclude that the transactions occurred within the apartment or, at the least, that evidence of or from the transactions would be located there. See Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 522 (2006); Commonwealth v. Turner,', ', 669-670 (2008). Further, the additional facts of three controlled purchases, the method used by the informant to contact the defendant, the surveillance, and the reasonable inferences drawn from those facts tip the balance in favor of the Commonwealth. Contrast Commonwealth v. Olivares,', ', 600-601 (1991); Commonwealth v. Smith,', "", 908-909 (2003).

Between 5:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M., MEC 506 began leaking diesel fuel onto the ground. Two Pan Am employees noticed the odor of diesel fuel at around 7:00 P. M. and reported the odor to their superiors between 8:30 P.M. and 9:00 P.M. About one hour later, after finishing an unrelated task, the two employees observed MEC 506 spilling fuel ""like . . .

At 6:30 A.M., a Pan Am corporate vice-president called a train master and asked about the spill. The train master, based on his observations of the railyard from approximately three hours earlier, told the vice-president that an estimated 100 gallons of fuel had spilled.', 'Clean-up operations continued throughout the morning of August 9. Fuel from MEC 506 had saturated the ballast -- crushed rock used to support railroad track -- and underlying soil around the locomotive. Pan Am employees excavated this ballast and soil and removed it from the site in several fifty-five-gallon drums. These employees replaced the excavated material with new ballast. Heavy machinery facilitated these operations, which continued throughout August 9.', ""At 2:45 P.M., on August 9, an anonymous informant alerted DEP to the spill by telephone. None of the four corporate defendants had made a previous report of the release to DEP. About seventeen hours had passed since Pan Am employees had first reported the spill to their superiors.

The judge declined to give such an instruction as Pan Am requested, and Pan Am objected.

This interpretation does not run afoul of the requirement of Life Care that the Commonwealth prove that an agent or employee had the requisite mens rea in order to convict a corporate defendant of a crime requiring proof of wanton or reckless conduct or of intentional or wilful conduct.

The instructions further distinguished, appropriately and clearly, between corporate liability based on Pan Am's agents or employees violating § 11 (i.e., respondeat superior liability, see notes 6 & 14, supra) and corporate liability based on the corporation itself violating § 11 because, through its agents and employees, it had the necessary knowledge of the release and failed to notify DEP in time. There was no error in the instructions."", '', '5. Corporate probation. Pan Am argues that the judge had no statutory authority to place the corporate defendants on probation. Pan Am insists that the term ""person,"" as used in the relevant statute, G. L. c. 276, § 87,', 'does not encompass corporations. We disagree.', 'Page 35', 'The statute governing construction of the General Laws, G. L. c. 4, § 7, provides, ""[i]n construing statutes the following words shall have the meanings herein given, unless a contrary intention clearly appears: . . . Twenty-third, \'Person\' or \'whoever\' shall include corporations, societies, associations and partnerships."" Accordingly, unless a contrary intention clearly appears in G.

Angelo Todesca Corp.,', ', 135-136 (2006) (""[B]y including corporations within the general statutory definition of \'person,\' the Legislature evinced a general intent to hold corporations legally accountable for their actions.

Although Pan Am points to various aspects of that statute, such as references to placing probationers ""in the care of [a] probation officer,"" age of the probationer, and offenders who have committed certain sex abuse crimes, see G. L. c. 276, § 87, these minor inconsistencies do not amount to sufficient contrary legislative intent. Similar references to ""defendant(s),"" ""he,"" or ""she,"" or other language intended to alter the meaning of the statute as applied to natural persons, appear throughout the Commonwealth\'s criminal statutes. See, e.g., G. L. c. 90, § 24G(c) (referring to ""right to operate"" a motor vehicle of a ""defendant"" charged with violating G. L. c. 90, § 24G[b]), as amended by St. 1986, c. 620, § 16. Because it is well established that such references do not evidence legislative intent to exclude corporations from the definition of ""person"" as used in those criminal statutes, see, e.g., Angelo Todesca Corp., supra, it follows that similar language in G. L. c. 276, § 87, also does not evidence this intent to exclude corporations from its operation.', '', 'Nor are we convinced otherwise by the 2003 enactment of', 'Page 36', 'G. L. c. 21L, a criminal statute known as the Environmental Endangerment Act, which includes a specific directive for sentencing judges to impose a special probation condition on corporations in certain circumstances. General Laws c. 21L, § 3(a), authorizes a special probation condition, mandatory for subsequent offenses under G. L. c. 21L, § 2(b)(2), and discretionary for first time offenses, that a defendant organization pay for an environmental audit (the recommendations of which the court is empowered to enforce). The statute deems this special condition sufficiently important that it authorizes a court to impose ""a term of probation that is longer than the term otherwise permitted by law, if the court determines that the longer term is necessary to implement the environmental audit."" G. L. c. 21L, § 3(e), inserted by St. 2003, c. 26, § 123. Accordingly, we see nothing in the enactment of G. L. c. 21L, with specific authorization for corporate probation subject to a statutorily prescribed special condition in certain cases, to affect the conclusion that a judge may impose standard probation conditions on a corporation in other cases, as she may on any legal person, pursuant to G.

First, Pan Am argues that the judge erroneously failed to instruct that piercing the corporate veil requires a showing of fraudulent purpose or fraudulent conduct in the parent's control of the subsidiary. The Supreme Judicial Court has repeatedly stated since My Bread that two separate and distinct means of piercing the corporate veil exist and that only"", 'Page 39', 'one of them requires a showing of fraud.

The judge therefore properly declined to give the instruction because fraudulent purpose or conduct is not a necessary element of imposing derivative liability, whether criminal or civil, on a parent corporation.', 'Second, and more generally, Pan Am claims that the judge erroneously instructed the jury to consider the factors in Beneficial Fin. Co., which do not include fraudulent purpose or conduct, instead of those in M.C.K., which do include fraud.

Statutory definition of ""day."" Pan Am claims that the judge improperly instructed the jury that the word ""day,"" as used in G. L. c. 21E, § 11, means a calendar day, not any given continuous twenty-four hour period. Consequently, Pan Am argues, only one conviction per defendant was possible, rather than two, for the relevant period from the evening of August 8 through the afternoon of August 9.

We consider the probable cause question with respect first to the cocaine, and then as to the records and proceeds.', '1. Cocaine. The defendant argues that the affidavit that accompanied the warrant application provided insufficient evidence to support a probable cause determination that cocaine was located at 191 Belmont Street. We agree. The affidavit revealed that the defendant had taken up residence in the second and third floors at 191 Belmont Street.', 'However, ""probable cause to expect that drugs will be present in a home is not established', 'Page 117', 'by the fact that the defendant lives there."" Commonwealth v. Pina,', ', 441 (2009) (citations omitted). Rather, the affidavit must contain ""specific information"" explaining why there was probable cause to believe that cocaine would be found at the defendant\'s home other than it being the residence of the defendant. Ibid. See Commonwealth v. Smith,', ', 908 (2003).', 'Here, such ""specific information"" from which we could infer that cocaine was located in the 191 Belmont Street apartment is absent from the affidavit. Not a single drug deal was observed, suspected, or reported to have occurred at 191 Belmont Street. Contrast O\'Day, 440 Mass. at 302 (frequent, brief visitations to defendant\'s residence consistent with drug distribution and storage). In fact, the affidavit explicitly states that the 191 Belmont Street apartment was unlikely to contain narcotics. The defendant\'s apparent method of distribution, as supported by the facts and Bonanca\'s inferences, was to distribute and store drugs at 29 Goddard Road and not at 191 Belmont Street.', ""Accordingly, this case is unlike cases where drug dealers were observed leaving their residence prior to making a sale at a location where they would not have a stash of drugs. Contrast O'Day, 440 Mass. at 304-305 (infer supply of drugs at home where defendant departs from his residence to a bar to consummate a drug deal). Because the sales in question all took place at 29 Goddard Road, where police believed the defendant was storing the drugs, observations of the defendant departing from 191 Belmont Street prior to drug sales or returning there immediately after sales do not necessarily support an inference that the defendant stored cocaine at 191 Belmont Street. See Commonwealth v. Medina,"", '(2009).', 'In sum, the affidavit failed to present probable cause to search 191 Belmont Street for cocaine.', 'Page 118', ""2. Proceeds and records. The Commonwealth argues that any evidence found at 191 Belmont Street of drug contraband, as well as the ammunition and firearms found there, were fruits of a permissible search for proceeds and records. We agree. The affidavit does provide probable cause to believe that proceeds and records related to the defendant's cocaine operation at 29 Goddard Road would exist in the 191 Belmont Street apartment. Probable cause to search for proceeds and records is sometimes found in addition to probable cause to search for drugs. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Luthy,"", ', 107 (2007); Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 299-300 (2009). However, in some circumstances, probable cause exists to search only for proceeds or records related to drug distribution, but not to search for the drugs themselves. See Santiago, 66 Mass. App. Ct. at 522 (""records, ledgers, or proceeds""); Commonwealth v. Turner,', ', 669 (2008) (proceeds).', ""The affidavit here was premised on Bonanca's specialized knowledge of drug distribution operations."", 'Bonanca stated that based on his training and past experience, it is common for narcotics organizations to maintain one empty dwelling for the sole purpose of drug storage and distribution, and another, separate dwelling to house the proceeds and records of the drug operation. Bonanca stated that ""[d]rug distributors use this strategy for the purpose of eliminating any personal connection with any seized narcotics."" In evaluating an affidavit for probable cause, ""weight must be given to the special experience of a law enforcement officer who has executed an affidavit. For example, where such an officer states that he has drawn inferences from facts which an inexperienced person might not draw from those facts, the magistrate may rely on those inferences."" Santiago, supra at 521, quoting from Taglieri, supra at 199.', 'Moreover, ""taking the affidavit as a whole, interpreting it in', 'Page 119', 'a commonsense fashion,"" there was sufficient indirect evidence to support Bonanca\'s inference that 191 Belmont Street contained proceeds and records. Santiago, supra at 522. In Santiago, the court found sufficient indirect evidence supporting the affiant\'s conclusion that records, ledgers or proceeds were contained in a dwelling based on the following information:', '""[1] that the defendant was a drug dealer responsible for a large-scale operation; [2] that he resided at, or at least had unlimited access to, [the residence]; [3] that he and his subordinates used record-generating cellular telephones; [4] that the bulk of the narcotics were', 'kept at [the residence]; and [5] that the defendant had access to a [vehicle], from which drugs were delivered and in which he met with his compatriot to transact \'business.\' ""', 'Ibid. (emphasis and numeration added). We conclude that the affidavit here provided similar indirect evidence to warrant a probable cause finding, and that those factors collectively provide the necessary ""specific information"" providing ""a sufficient nexus between the defendant\'s drug-selling activity [in the stash house on 29 Goddard Road] and his residence to establish probable cause to search the residence [for money and records]."" Pina, 453 Mass. at 440- 441. See Smith, 57 Mass. App. Ct. at 908. We note that Pina did not involve a search of a residence for money or records relating to drug activity in a stash house for which there was probable cause to search for contraband. There was thus no need or occasion for the Pina court to comment on the validity or applicability of the Santiago factors. We discern no reason why those factors cannot supply the necessary link here for probable cause, and we consider them now.', 'First, it was reasonable to infer that the defendant was a drug dealer', 'responsible for a large-scale operation. We note that the Santiago case does not define ""large-scale operation."" However,', 'Page 120', 'because the instant defendant conducted business with at least one associate, maintained an empty dwelling for the purpose of distributing and storing drugs, and supplied drugs to Shaun Hillegass, from whom police seized trafficking quantities of cocaine, such a conclusion is warranted. Compare id. at 516-522. In an operation of this scale, business records can be expected. Id. at 522; Rodriguez, 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 298-299 (evidence sufficient to find drug enterprise; drug enterprises generate records).', 'Second, the statement from the property owner, combined with police surveillance, provides sufficient evidence to infer that the defendant resided at 191 Belmont Street.', '', ""Third, the affidavit provided evidence of the defendant's custom of arranging drug sales through record-generating cellular telephone calls."", ""The bills generated by the defendant's use of his telephone reasonably could be expected to be found in the defendant's residence and would be of significant evidentiary value. Santiago, supra at 521-22 & n.16. Further, the defendant's cellular telephone use inside the 191 Belmont Street apartment"", 'buttresses the inference that business records were kept at that location. Luthy, 69 Mass. App. Ct. at 107 (where defendant received cellular telephone call at his residence to arrange drug sale, magistrate can infer that defendant kept records of his drug business at his residence); Rodriguez, supra at 300.', 'Fourth, the police surveillance revealing drug activity at 29 Goddard Road but not at 191 Belmont Street, is consistent with', 'Page 121', ""Bonanca's opinion, noted above, that in an effort to conceal a personal connection with the seized contraband, the defendant likely maintained a separate dwelling to house the proceeds and records of the drug operation, if not the drugs themselves."", ""Fifth, the defendant had access to a vehicle, specifically a 1997 BMW sedan. Although here, unlike in Santiago, no evidence suggests that the vehicle was instrumental in drug deliveries, the defendant's access to the 1997 BMW suggests an alternative inference. On multiple occasions police observed the defendant driving directly to or from 191 Belmont Street to consummate drug deals."", ""One could infer that the defendant would be unwilling to keep proceeds in his car or at 29 Goddard Road (an unoccupied apartment the location of which was known to several customers) due to risk of theft. See O'Day, 440 Mass. at 303. It follows that the defendant likely transported his proceeds from the deals to 191 Belmont Street. Luthy, supra at 108 (likely that the defendant, who remained under surveillance after a drug sale, brought the fruits of the transaction into his house). See Turner, 71 Mass. App. Ct. at 669."", ""Finally, while not identified as a factor in Santiago, the defendant's concealment of his residence at 191 Belmont Street buttresses the probability that proceeds and records would be kept at this residence. The defendant signed no rental agreement and paid his rent in cash. This evidence supports the inference that the defendant was attempting to conceal items in the apartment. In sum, the indirect evidence provided by the affidavit sufficiently supported Bonanca's inference that proceeds and records were kept at 191 Belmont Street."", ""Moreover, the affidavit presents a strong temporal nexus between 191 Belmont Street and the defendant's drug business, such that it presents probable cause that proceeds and records were stored at this residence. Probable cause to search a location requires a timely nexus to the illegal activity. Pina, 453 Mass. at 442. Here, the search warrant was obtained on April"", 'Page 122', '26, 2002, on or about the date of the second controlled purchase, in which the defendant left from and returned to 191 Belmont Street. See Turner, supra at 669 (timely nexus established where police observed the defendant return to his residence after three drug deals, the last within seventy-two hours of the affidavit). Furthermore, the evidence that the defendant sold drugs from November, 2001, through April, 2002, and lived at 191 Belmont Street for about six months prior to his arrest on April 19, 2002, supports an inference that he was dealing drugs for, roughly, the entire time he was living at this apartment.', 'In sum, based on the affiant\'s specialized knowledge, which was supported by indirect evidence and a sufficient temporal nexus, the clerk-magistrate properly concluded that the affidavit established probable cause to search the 191 Belmont Street apartment for proceeds and records. See Santiago, supra at 522 (affiant\'s specialized knowledge coupled with indirect evidence in the affidavit sufficient for magistrate\'s probable cause conclusion that records could be found in the defendant\'s suspected residence). See also Pina, supra at 442 (""Probable cause to search a particular location for contraband requires a timely . . . nexus to the illegal activity""). Accordingly, the magistrate\'s reliance on Detective Bonanca\'s inference that 191 Belmont Street contained proceeds and records was warranted.', '', 'Although the ""warrant was considered invalid as to the search for drugs [,] . . . it does not follow that the drugs and other items seized need be suppressed."" Turner, supra at 670. Rather, if the items, including any narcotics, seized from the 191 Belmont Street apartment ""were seized in plain view \'within the scope and intensity of the search permitted under the terms of the valid portions of the warrant,\' namely the search for [proceeds and records], they need not be suppressed."" Ibid., citing Commonwealth v. Lett,', ', 147 (1984). See Rodriguez, supra at 300, n.6. For example, the two loaded guns that form the basis of the ammunition charges were discovered on a', 'Page 123', ""bedroom floor in 191 Belmont Street. Because these items were in plain view to police officers during the search, they should not be suppressed. In the event that the defendant believes that the drugs and other items seized from 191 Belmont Street did not come within the officers' plain view while they were conducting a legal search in places where proceeds and records might reasonably be found, they may on remand seek a hearing on that issue. See Turner, supra at 670."", 'B. Ballistics and drug certificates. The Commonwealth concedes, as it must, that it was a violation of the confrontation clause to admit the ballistics and drug certificates. See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009); Commonwealth v. Vasquez,', ', 351-352 (2010). Moreover, because the defendant objected to the admission of the certificates on constitutional grounds, we review the errors to determine whether they were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Muniz,', ', 168-69 (2010), citing Commonwealth v. Molina,', "", 211-212 (2003). Here, because the admission of these certificates was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we agree with the Commonwealth's concession that this case must be remanded for a new trial on the drug"", 'and firearm', 'convictions.', 'The defendant also argues that his convictions on ammunition charges must be overturned because the admission of a ballistic certificate with regard to one of the ammunition charges violated his constitutional rights where the expert who conducted the ballistics tests was not available for cross-examination. Commonwealth v. Brown,', ', 363 (2009). We disagree. The statute requires only that the ammunition was ""', 'for use in any firearm."" G. L. c. 140, § 121 (emphasis added).

See Muniz, supra at 172-173; Morales, supra at 671. In this case, both the silver handgun (count 004) and the AB10 semiautomatic pistol (count 005) were loaded', 'Page 124', 'when the officers found them. ""The cartridges themselves and the officer\'s testimony that they were found in the magazine[s], which [were] in the gun[s] at the time [they] were seized, provide overwhelming evidence that the cartridges met the statutory definition of ammunition."" Muniz, supra at 173. See Morales, supra at 671. Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of the ballistics certificate with respect to this charge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and affirm the defendant\'s convictions for unlawful possession of ammunition in counts 004 and 005.', '', ""Conclusion. We affirm the motion judge's decision to deny the defendant's motion to suppress evidence of records and proceeds found at 191 Belmont Street. With respect to other evidence found while conducting a search for proceeds and records, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion to make a determination as to the permissible fruits of the search.

We summarize the most significant facts from within the four corners of the twenty-two page affidavit in support of the warrant, prepared on May 25, 2001, by State police Trooper Dean LeVangie (affiant), an experienced narcotics investigator.', 'State police were informed in early 2001 by two confidential informants (CI1 and CI2) that they had purchased cocaine in Brockton from a Hispanic man named ""Mickey,"" ordering by cellular telephone numerous times in the previous few months. CI1 told police in February, 2001, that CI1 usually purchased cocaine from Mickey, who drove a black Cadillac vehicle with a tan roof, but that if he was not available, Mickey would send another Hispanic male who drove a small green car. Mickey provided CI1 with a telephone number to call to arrange for a sale, which would be conducted at a location designated by Mickey. CI1 was directed to the area of 20 Brook Street for these purchases. CI1 told police that the two men deal in larger', 'Page 164', 'quantities with a minimum of an ""8- ball"" (approximately three and one-half grams).', ""The trooper observed a white Cadillac vehicle parked at 20 Brook Street on February 27, 2001, and determined that it was registered to a Carmen Santiago (Carmen) at the same address. Utility company records indicated that the first-floor apartment at that address was listed to Miguel Santiago, and further investigation revealed that a second, older man, also named Miguel Santiago, lived there and was identified as Mickey from a photograph shown to CI1. Mickey's wife, Carmen, also lived there."", '', 'A controlled ""buy"" was arranged with CI1 on February 28, 2001. CI1 called the cellular telephone number that Mickey had given to CI1 and placed an order. After about forty-five minutes, police observed the location to which CI1 had been directed, and saw a Hispanic male drive up in a green Mazda automobile. After an exchange of money for a substance,', 'the police observed the green Mazda go to 88 South Leyden Street (hereafter the target location). The driver parked in the side driveway at the rear of the house, where he left the car and walked toward the rear of the house. Later, CI1 identified this man from a photograph as the defendant.', ""Police determined through the Registry of Motor Vehicles that the green Mazda was registered to the defendant at 88 South Leyden Street. The United States Postal Service confirmed that a person with the defendant's name received mail at the first-floor apartment at that address, although utility records were in the name of the owner of the building."", '', 'Page 165', 'A second controlled buy from the defendant was arranged with CI1 on March 19, 2001. After CI1 placed a telephone order, a police surveillance unit at 88 South Leyden Street was alerted, and the defendant was observed leaving through the rear door of the house, entering the green Mazda, and driving directly to the prearranged location. After an exchange the defendant returned to 88 South Leyden Street a ""short time later."" CI1 had obtained a plastic bag of a white powdered substance, which a field test indicated was cocaine.', '', 'CI2 made a controlled buy from Mickey on May 21, 2001, calling the same telephone number as used by CI1. CI2 arranged to purchase an 8-ball. Police established the same surveillance procedure.', 'At the target location they observed both a white Cadillac', 'and the green Mazda parked in the driveway. Mickey left in the white Cadillac and drove to the prearranged location to meet CI2. After the transaction, Mickey drove away, made a stop at a business, and returned directly to the target location. CI2 gave police a plastic bag of suspected cocaine, which CI2 had purchased from Mickey. Field testing indicated that it was cocaine. Later CI2 positively identified Mickey, from photographs obtained from the Registry of Motor Vehicles, as the elder Miguel Santiago, and also identified the defendant as the Hispanic man in a green car who sometimes made cocaine deliveries instead of Mickey.', 'Based on the drug transactions described in the affidavit, Trooper LeVangie opined that the defendant and Mickey operated a cocaine delivery service and that there was probable cause to believe that cocaine may be found in their possession at the target location. He requested a search warrant covering the first floor of the target location, the first floor of 20 Brook', 'Page 166', ""Street, the green Mazda, and the white Cadillac. Specifically, the warrant sought controlled substances; materials, products, and equipment used in manufacturing or distributing any controlled substances; records, computers, and electronic devices capable of storing information; and monies used in manufacturing, delivery, and distribution of controlled substances. A conforming search warrant was issued and executed on May 25, 2001. The search at the target location resulted in the seizure of items including cocaine, nearly $12,000 in cash, an electronic scale, and a firearm. The judge's order suppressed these items and statements the defendant made to the police while being detained during execution of the warrant at his residence."", '3. Discussion. The defendant argues that police observations of the controlled buys did not constitute sufficient probable cause to support a search of his residence. He asserts that because neither confidential informant', 'provided any information about his residence, and because he was a secondary figure in the observed events, there was no reason to believe controlled substances would be found there.', 'He also asserts that because there were no observations of him after March 19, 2001, the search warrant issued on May 25, 2001, was based on stale information.', 'a. Probable cause and nexus. We examine the affidavit submitted by Trooper LeVangie in accordance with familiar principles, reading it in a commonsense fashion to determine whether a magistrate could conclude that the items identified in the application for a search warrant probably would be found in the place to be searched.

There were no direct observations that the defendant (or Mickey) left from or', 'Page 168', ""returned to the first floor of the target location, because he parked at the rear of the building and the rear door generally could not be viewed.

An experienced Brockton narcotics unit police officer, Thomas Keating (affiant), applied for a warrant on April 10, 2009, to search the defendant\'s single-family home at 46 Vine Street in Brockton and a Chevrolet Tracker utility vehicle. The affiant stated in his supporting affidavit that he had been informed by a confidential informant (CI) that a described male known to him as ""Tony"" was dealing in ""crack"" cocaine from 46 Vine Street by responding to orders placed through telephone calls to a number CI had been given, and that Tony delivers the cocaine while driving a black Chevrolet Tracker utility vehicle with a specified Massachusetts registration tag (Chevy Tracker). CI described Tony as a black male, about five feet seven inches tall, with a medium build, wearing glasses. Police subsequently obtained a digital image of the defendant, Anthony Monteiro, from the Registry of Motor Vehicles, and from it CI positively identified the defendant as Tony. Police investigation determined that the defendant, his wife Sheila Gamble, and her son lived at 46 Vine Street; that the telephone number used by CI appeared on electric utility records billed to Sheila Gamble at that address; and that the Chevy Tracker was registered to Sheila Gamble. A criminal history of the defendant indicated that he had been convicted of trafficking in cocaine in 2002.', 'On March 11, 2009, CI agreed to make a controlled ""buy"" from Tony. CI first was searched by the affiant and found not to possess any controlled substances. Using the specified telephone number, CI called Tony in the presence of the affiant and made arrangements for a meeting at a location designated by Tony.', 'Page 173', ""The affiant and CI went to the designated location while two detectives conducted a surveillance of 46 Vine Street where the Chevy Tracker was observed parked in the driveway. Within five minutes of the telephone call, the detectives observed Tony walk out the front door, enter the Chevy Tracker, and back out of the driveway. They followed it to the designated location. The affiant observed the Chevy Tracker approach and watched CI go to the driver's side window for about forty-five seconds to one minute, then walk away as the vehicle left. The detectives followed the vehicle, saw it enter the driveway at 46 Vine Street, and saw Tony depart the vehicle and enter the front door of the premises. Meanwhile, CI directly approached the affiant, handing him an off-white, hard rock-like substance which he had obtained from Tony in exchange for the sum of money they had agreed on by telephone. The affiant field tested the substance and it tested positively for cocaine, which he turned in as evidence."", ""A second controlled buy was arranged by CI on March 15, 2009, following similar procedures, except that instead of there being two surveilling detectives, the affiant, after meeting with CI, drove to 46 Vine Street, saw the Chevy Tracker in the driveway, then returned to the designated location where he saw the Chevy Tracker arrive. CI approached the Chevy Tracker and stood at the driver's side window for about one minute. The Chevy Tracker drove away and CI gave the affiant an off-white, hard rock-like substance purchased from Tony. The affiant then drove by 46 Vine Street where he saw the Chevy Tracker parked in the driveway. Field testing again revealed the seized substance to be cocaine."", 'A third controlled buy was arranged on March 22, 2009, which occurred substantially as in the second buy, with the exception that it was at about five minutes prior to the telephone call placed by CI that the affiant drove by 46 Vine Street and observed the Chevy Tracker in the driveway. After the buy transaction was completed, the affiant drove back to 46 Vine Street where he saw the Chevy Tracker in the driveway about ten minutes after the buy.', 'A fourth controlled buy was arranged by CI on March 30, 2009. The same procedures as in the first controlled buy were', 'Page 174', 'followed; that is, two detectives saw Tony leave the house, followed the Chevy Tracker to the designated location, then followed it back to 46 Vine Street after the controlled buy and saw Tony enter the house.', 'A fifth controlled buy was arranged on April 9, 2009. About twenty minutes before CI made the telephone call, the affiant observed the Chevy Tracker in the driveway of 46 Vine Street, and while he was observing CI waiting for the arrival of the Chevy Tracker, a detective went to 46 Vine Street where he did not see the Chevy Tracker. Within five minutes after the buy transaction was completed, the detective saw the Chevy Tracker enter and park in the driveway and the driver, Tony, walk toward the rear of the house where the rear door is located.', 'The affiant requested the issuance of a warrant authorizing a search of 46 Vine Street and the Chevy Tracker. The warrant authorized a search for, inter alia, controlled substances; materials, equipment, and records used in processing and delivery of controlled substances; and monetary proceeds from the sale of controlled substances. The return of the affiant, who conducted the search, listed as items seized a clear glass jar containing an off-white, hard rock-like substance in water, weighing thirty-four grams, and a magnetic key holder containing ten individual pieces of crack cocaine, weighing five grams. Also seized were $3,372 in currency, plastic baggies with cut corners, a digital scale, and ""paperwork.""', ""Discussion.

Officer DaSilva arrived on scene within minutes. As she was preparing to search the area for casings she received a second dispatch that a caller had reported seeing a dark blue or green motor vehicle leaving the scene after hearing the shots being fired. The caller supplied the dispatch with a registration number MA9122W. She then received a report from Lieutenant Sergio, the shift commander, that he had spotted the motor vehicle with that license plate. He advised the officers of his location. Officer DaSilva and other cruisers joined Lieutenant Sergio who had been', 'Page 273', 'following the motor vehicle. Lieutenant Sergio then executed a stop of the motor vehicle. . . .', '""Lieutenant Robert Sergio . . . heard the report of the gun shots fired at 17 Wilmington Street. Wilmington Street runs between Main Street and Montello Street. After this dispatch he headed toward Montello Street because he believed that someone fleeing in a motor vehicle would head in that direction. At that time he heard a second broadcast stating that a dark green or blue motor vehicle with license plate number 9122WY left the scene after hearing the shots. At that time he observed a motor vehicle coming south on Montello Street matching that description. This was a short distance from Wilmington Street. Lieutenant Sergio followed the motor vehicle and observed the license plate to be that in the broadcast 9122WY. He then confirmed with dispatch the plate number. He then notified the other cruisers and continued to follow this motor vehicle. He eventually was joined by the other cruisers at which time he activated his emergency lights and pulled the vehicle over. Because of the nature of the call (gunshots) he ordered all occupants out of the motor vehicle. He kept his hand on his sidearm although he never took his gun out of the holster. The defendants were pat frisked for officer safety. No contraband was found on these individuals. . . . When Lieutenant Sergio found out that a gun was located in the motor vehicle he gave each individual a Miranda warning. The defendant acknowledged he understood same. Lieutenant Sergio asked the group whose gun it was. The defendant replied that it was his gun and that he did not have a license to carry. The defendant was then arrested.""', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress because the traffic stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion as set forth in Terry v.

The fact that the officers went back to the scene and spoke with the initial caller supports a reasonable inference that they were able to do so because the caller either had identified herself or could be traced by means of caller identification. While the record would have been better developed had the 911 recording been introduced or the dispatch described in greater detail, cf. Commonwealth v. Costa, 448 Mass. at 517 (caller ""provid[ed] information to the police after knowing that her call was being recorded, and that the number she was calling from had been identified""), we conclude that the first caller was identifiable and thus placed her anonymity sufficiently at risk such that her reliability should have been accorded greater weight than that of an anonymous informant. By contrast, although the police testified that dispatch attempted to contact the second caller by telephone ""a couple of times,"" this was not sufficient to make the second caller identifiable in the absence of any additional facts in the record to indicate or support the inference that the caller knew the call was being recorded or that the caller\'s number was identifiable.

Bielitz was approached in the courthouse by the prosecutor who was handling the Commonwealth\'s case. The prosecutor suggested that the Commonwealth would consider recommending a sentence of credit for time served and straight probation on a guilty plea, in exchange for the defendant\'s testimony against her husband. Bielitz conveyed this offer to the defendant, while she was in lockup, and strongly urged her to consider it. When Corby was being taken out of the courthouse to be transported back to jail, having apparently either overheard or been informed about the offer, he began yelling at Bielitz, ""there [are] to be no [plea] discussions.""

Similar concerns were raised at the sentencing hearing. As the motion judge found, Bielitz sought permission from the defendant to be able to argue at sentencing how much she had been abused by her husband and constrained or coerced by him to commit the acts that formed the basis for the guilty verdicts. After a discussion at which Bielitz, Murphy, Corby, and the defendant were present, it was decided that Murphy would represent both Corby and the defendant at sentencing and that Bielitz would not address the', 'Page 580', ""judge at the defendant's sentencing hearing.

He ruled that a competency hearing was not required at the time of trial because competency had never been raised as an issue before or during the trial and because the defendant demonstrated an understanding of the proceedings and an ability to consult with counsel, as evidenced by her jury waiver. The judge also rejected the defendant's substantive claim that she was not competent to stand trial or to be sentenced."", 'The judge based his ruling that a competency hearing was not required on two grounds. First, he noted that the issue of the defendant\'s competency was ""never . . . raised by anyone"" throughout the trial and pretrial proceedings and that there had been no suggestion during the three-week trial that the defendant was incompetent. Second, he reviewed the jury waiver colloquy conducted by the trial judge with the defendant and concluded that the defendant answered all of the questions in an appropriate and responsive manner.

Commonwealth,', "", 514 (1979), the judge's acceptance of her jury waiver demonstrated her competency."", 'Further, according to the motion judge, the defendant\'s predominant concern was to regain the custody of her children. The judge found that ""[i]t was all or nothing, namely, she had to go to trial and hope that she received not guilty verdicts."" He continued, ""Just because [her trial strategy was unsuccessful and] she lost with the fact finder does not mean that she was incompetent.""', 'Discussion. On appeal, the defendant argues that her rights were violated by reason of a failure to conduct a timely competency hearing before or during the trial.', ""She also argues that the evidence demonstrated that she was incompetent to assist in her defense, because she suffered from battered woman syndrome as the result of abuse inflicted upon her by her husband, the codefendant, and that the motion judge's conclusion to the contrary was wrong."", '', '""It has long been the law of this Commonwealth that the \'trial, conviction or sentencing of a person charged with a criminal offence while he is legally incompetent violates his constitutional rights of due process\' . . . , whether under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of this Commonwealth.""

The judge also accepted, at least implicitly, that there was', 'Page 587', 'evidence the defendant suffered from battered woman syndrome.', ""Each of the three experts described the defendant as a victim of battered woman syndrome, and each agreed that Corby exercised a tremendous degree of control over her. The opinions of the experts were corroborated by the defendant's son and by both of the defendant's attorneys, as well as the defendant's own testimony."", 'In addition, truly startling evidence was presented at the hearing, and apparently credited by the judge, revealing the remarkable amount of control that Corby exercised over the defendant throughout the proceedings. Bielitz, in particular, testified about this in chilling detail.', 'Once Corby isolated the defendant from her attorney, or at least from the opportunity to consult with him privately, he then insisted that the two proceed with a ""unified defense"" and prohibited any suggestion of a plea or separate trials. This ""unified defense,"" along with regular direct and indirect contact with the defendant, permitted Corby to maintain tight control over the defendant even though they were held in separate facilities.', 'Contrast Pike v.

Pike,', "", 224-225 (2000), where the motion judge explicitly disbelieved the defendant's testimony about her alleged abuse. Here, it appears that the judge credited all of the testimony regarding the history of violent abuse and regarding Corby Adkinson's successful efforts to control the defendant's defense. In the judge's view, however, that evidence did not raise a doubt about the defendant's competency, in part, perhaps, because his definition of competency was too narrow. In any event, we disagree with his conclusion."", ""We have considered and rejected another aspect of the motion judge's decision. He placed, as does the Commonwealth, significant emphasis on the suggestion that the defendant's goal of reunification with her children was the basis for her pursuit of the ill-advised unified defense, because a finding of not guilty was the only way she would ever regain custody of her children. In so doing the judge observed, accurately, that a defendant has a right to reject a defense suggested by her attorney and that a foolish or unsuccessful choice does not render her incompetent."", 'We note at the outset that the record support is thin for the', 'Page 589', 'finding that reunification with the children was the driving force supporting the defendant\'s acquiescence in a unified defense; that finding is based almost exclusively on the fact that the defendant retracted her statement, made when she was in Solomon for a psychiatric evaluation, that Corby was abusive, after his lawyer told her on Christmas Day, 1995, that she had better stop telling the staff what was going on at home or she would never get her children back. The defendant also acknowledged on cross-examination at the hearing that she knew she would not get her children back if she was convicted. However, the record also shows that, when Bielitz testified at the motion hearing that it was ""foolhardy"" to go to trial, the prosecutor unsuccessfully pressed him to concede that the defendant chose trial because a not guilty verdict was the only way she could be reunited with her children and that was her paramount goal. Bielitz responded that he did not know if the defendant understood that strategy and that it was not the viewpoint he had adopted. In addition, the defendant testified at the motion hearing that she had wanted her children to be safe and ""if that meant that they were in DSS custody, then that was safe to me.""', ""Even assuming, however, that reunification with her children was an important goal underlying the defendant's decisions, our inquiry remains whether the evidence raises a substantial doubt as to the defendant's ability to consult rationally with her attorney and assist her defense in achieving whatever goal she chose. The issue in a competency inquiry is not whether a defendant has made poor trial choices. See Commonwealth v. Robidoux,"", ', 156 (2007), quoting from Commonwealth v. Martin,', ', 721 (1997) (defendant has a constitutional right to make decisions relating to his defense because ""respect for individual autonomy requires that he be allowed to go to jail under his own banner if he so desires and he makes the choice \'with eyes open\' ""). Rather, the question is whether the defendant, in making those choices, has the ability to consult rationally with counsel and assist in that defense.', ""We also note that, while a defendant is clearly entitled to pursue an ill-advised defense, the choice of a unified defense in this case does provide at least some additional evidence of the defendant's incompetency. No one associated with this case"", 'Page 590', 'believed that the defense was sound. Her own attorney called it ""foolhardy,"" and the motion judge apparently agreed.', ""The defendant's only viable defense at trial was one based on battered woman syndrome, presented in a separate trial.

Central to our analysis is the overwhelming evidence of Corby's ongoing control throughout the proceedings, including in particular the fact that he was able to forestall the defendant's private consultation with her attorney.

In May of 1995, the defendant pleaded guilty in Superior Court in Barnstable County to a single count of indecent assault and battery on a child under age fourteen, G. L. c. 265, § 13B. The indictment charged him with commission of the offense in Eastham during August of 1993.

The Rhode Island charges were that he had assaulted the same Massachusetts juvenile and two other boys in Newport during 1993. On the Massachusetts offense he received a suspended sentence of from nine to ten years; and on the Rhode Island offense, a suspended sentence of ten years. Both sentences included probationary terms; the Massachusetts sentence was to run concurrently with the Rhode Island sentence.', 'In 1997, the defendant moved to California. Rhode Island and Massachusetts transferred his probation supervision to that State. In January of 1998, police arrested him for providing marijuana to a minor. He pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, Cal. Penal Code § 272 (2008). In June of 1998, extradition proceedings returned him to Rhode Island. In September, a Rhode Island judge re-probated him with added conditions. In November, police in Rhode Island arrested him upon a new charge of child molestation. In June, 1999, a Rhode Island judge found him in violation of probation and imposed the original sentence of ten years in State prison. Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Department of Probation lodged a warrant with the Rhode Island Department of Correction for the subsequent appearance of the defendant in Superior Court in Barnstable County for revocation of probation and imposition of the Massachusetts sentence.', ""2. Defendant's incarceration. The defendant remained imprisoned in Rhode Island until his parole in May of 2004. During incarceration, he participated in multiple rehabilitative programs and as a result earned 570 days of good time credit. Upon his parole, Massachusetts took custody of him. The Department of Probation charged him with violation of the terms upon which his suspended Massachusetts sentence depended. He remained confined in a house of correction for the ensuing two years while his counsel sought to dismiss the Massachusetts probation surrender proceeding and to resolve an open charge in Rhode Island."", 'In June, 2006, a Superior Court judge conducted a surrender hearing and found the defendant in violation. On August 18, 2006, the judge imposed the original sentence of from nine to', 'Page 629', 'ten years. The judge credited the defendant with 3,028 days (or eight years and 106 days) for time served in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.', ""The judge did not grant any credit for the good time earned in Rhode Island.

L. c. 127, § 129D, for his participation in rehabilitative programs during incarceration in Rhode Island. That provision confers discretionary authority upon', 'Page 630', 'DOC to grant such credit.', 'Because the mittimus showed that the defendant started his Massachusetts sentence on August 18, 2006, DOC notified him that he lacked the status of a sentenced prisoner for purposes of G. L. c. 127, § 129D, while he was incarcerated in Rhode Island and that therefore he could not receive Massachusetts earned good time during that period. See McNeil v. Commissioner of Correction,', ', 826 (1994) (only sentenced prisoners may receive earned good time under § 129D). DOC advised the defendant that he would be eligible to receive earned good time for his participation in the Rhode Island programs if a corrected mittimus designated November 4, 1998, as the starting date of his sentence.', 'On December 6, 2007, the judge allowed the defendant\'s motion to correct the mittimus; however, the judge wrote in the margin of the motion that ""the effective date of this allowance will be January 2, 2008.""

Sentencing counsel for DOC testified that DOC could not award the Rhode Island good time earned before the Massachusetts sentencing in August, 2006, because until then, the defendant occupied the status of a pretrial detainee ineligible for credit under the rule of McNeil v. Commissioner of Correction, 417 Mass. at 826. Sentencing counsel testified further that the judge's April 16, 2008, order correcting the mittimus made the defendant eligible to receive earned good time for the Rhode Island programs but that DOC had not evaluated the merits of his request because his criminal sentence had already expired."", 'The judge concluded that the defendant had remained a lawful prisoner as of the petition date of December 17, 2007, and denied the motion to dismiss. The SDP process went forward to trial, adjudication of SDP status, and commitment to the center.', 'Analysis. The defendant contends that the judge effectively corrected the mittimus of his Massachusetts sentence on December 6, 2007, so as to establish its starting date as November 4, 1998; and that the correction per se credited him with the 570 days of Rhode Island earned good time so as to bring his Massachusetts sentence to completion before the petition date of December 17, 2007,', 'and to entitle him to dismissal of the petition. The following reasons defeat that argument.', ""First, the judge's allowance on December 6, 2007, of the motion to correct the mittimus included the reservation that the"", 'Page 632', 'effective date of the allowance was to be January 2, 2008, and, on the latter date, he reconsidered the motion and corrected the release date to April 12, 2008. Thus the actual date on which the mittimus was corrected to give the November 4, 1998, start date was not December 6, 2007, but rather April 16, 2008, or some four months after the day the Commonwealth filed the SDP petition. See note 7, supra, and the accompanying text. The judge\'s expression on December 6, 2007, of a willingness to allow the correction on January 2, 2008, was not a presently effective ruling or order. ""A judge\'s power to reconsider his own decisions during the pendency of a case is firmly rooted in the common law, and the adoption of [a rule of criminal procedure] was not intended to disturb this authority."" Commonwealth v. Haskell,', ', 792 (2003). See Commonwealth v. Downs,', ', 469 (1991) (""Judges are not condemned to abstain from entertaining second thoughts that may be better ones""). He retained discretion on January 2 to defer action to April.', 'Second, even if December 6, 2007, were the effective date of the allowance of the motion to correct the mittimus, the action would not have accomplished the accreditation of the desired 570 days. The motion called for the judge to amend the starting date of the Massachusetts sentence; it did not request the award of the Rhode Island earned good time. The mittimus correction simply made the defendant a sentenced prisoner from November 4, 1998, onward, and thereby rendered him eligible to receive the Rhode Island good time credit.', 'In accordance with G. L. c. 127, § 129D, discretion to award earned good time to prisoners remained vested in the DOC. See note 6, supra; Piggott v. Commissioner of Correction,', ', 684 (1996) (§ 129D ""unambiguously gives the commissioner discretion whether or not to award earned good time credits for participation in rehabilitative programs""). A prisoner does not have any entitlement to earned good time until the commissioner acts.', '', 'Page 633', 'See Haverty v. Commissioner of Correction,', ', 5-6 (2003) (prisoners have no statutory or constitutional right to earned good time). See also Jackson v. Hogan,', ', 379 (1983). Therefore, to receive earned good time for his participation in the Rhode Island programs, the defendant needed still to petition the commissioner and to receive a favorable decision. Furthermore, that credit must have accrued to him before the petition date of December 17, 2007. No statutory or regulatory source provides for retroactive effect for good time credit in the present circumstances.', 'Finally, the exercise of independent judgment by DOC would operate with special importance in these circumstances. The case required DOC to evaluate the quality of rehabilitative programs administered not under its own auspices, but rather those of a sister State. We cannot assume that DOC would mechanically adopt the determination by a separate government of the quality of rehabilitation or the quantity of credit attributable to those programs.', 'In the proper exercise of the police power, DOC retained separate sovereign authority and nondelegable', 'Page 634', 'responsibility to assess the entitlement and the timing of the release of a recidivist offender into its own population.', 'In this instance, it never received the occasion necessary for the exercise of that judgment.', ""Conclusion. As of the date of the Commonwealth's submission of a petition under G. L. c. 123A, § 12(b), DOC had not exercised its discretionary judgment of his entitlement to sentence credit. That determination was necessary for an entitlement to release before the petition date. He therefore remained a lawful prisoner subject to the process of the SDP statutory scheme."", 'Judgment and order of commitment affirmed.']"

She further testified that Milot told her that he found the key in Hughes's house for the locked bedroom door, unlocked the door, and found the guns, ultimately taking them from Hughes's home. McConologue testified that she advised her brother to call Hughes and return the pistols to him, that Milot did not want to tell Hughes that he had taken the guns, but that Milot agreed to put them back the way he had found them."", ""On February 25, 2002, Hughes picked up Milot around 7:00 A.M. and brought Milot to his house. Once they were at Hughes's house, Hughes showed Milot the front doorbell that he wanted Milot to repair. Hughes then left his house to run some errands, returning to check on Milot's progress about two hours later. When Hughes returned home, he found Milot's body covered with blood in the front doorway of his home. The police and an ambulance were called and upon their arrival, Milot was pronounced dead.

It is clear that, at a minimum, Milot stole and had possession of a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of the felony of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.', ',', ""Milot's actions constitute the sort of conduct described in Restatement"", 'Page 96', '(Second) of Torts § 889 comment b (1977), whereby a plaintiff is ""barred from recovery for harm caused by violation of [a] statute . . .

Ryan's claims against Glock. The plaintiff brought claims of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, negligence, wrongful death, and unfair and deceptive acts and practices against Glock. These claims relate to both the Glock Model 17 pistol (Glock pistol) and the pistol's storage case (gun case). The judge granted summary judgment on all claims after finding that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 7901-7903 (2006) (PLCAA or Act) barred the plaintiff's claims against Glock. The plaintiff appeals, arguing that, on the facts in this case, the PLCAA does not apply."", ""The gun case at issue here has a post with a protruding wing or flange in the center. This design means that the Glock pistol's trigger and trigger safety must be fully rearward in order to fit into the case. When the Glock pistol is cocked and ready to fire, the trigger moves to the forward position with the trigger lock positively protruding. Once cocked, the trigger and trigger safety would need to be moved fully rearward again in order to fit over the post in the gun case. These are the same steps that would need to be taken to fire the Glock pistol."", 'An orange sticker inside the gun case reads, ""CAUTION: PRIOR TO PLACING PISTOL INTO CONTAINER UNLOAD PISTOL. FOR UNLOADING PROCEDURES PLEASE REFER TO GLOCK INSTRUCTION MANUAL."" In order to unload the Glock pistol, the magazine must be removed, any round in the chamber must be ejected, the chamber should be checked to ensure that no round remains in the chamber, and the pistol should be cocked once more and the trigger depressed while pointing the gun in a safe direction.', 'The plaintiff alleges that the Glock pistol and gun case ""were', 'Page 98', 'defective because the [gun] case caused the loaded Glock . . . pistol . . . to discharge through the case and because the pistol was likely to discharge unintendedly"" and that ""Glock so negligently and carelessly designed the Glock Model 17 pistol and storage case . . . that the pistol discharged into the Decedent\'s body mortally wounding the Decedent."" The plaintiff\'s claims of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and design defect are thus based on the interaction between the Glock pistol and the gun case. We now consider whether the claims, as formulated by the plaintiff, are barred by the PLCAA.', 'The PLCAA was enacted on October 26, 2005, and provides immunity to firearms manufacturers and dealers from any lawsuit, pending or otherwise, fitting the Act\'s definition of a ""qualified civil liability action."" 15 U.S.C. §§ 7902- 7903 (2006). See Ileto v. Glock, Inc., 421 F. Supp. 2d 1274, 1283 (C.D. Cal. 2006), aff\'d, 565 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3320 (2010). The proper analysis for determining the applicability of the PLCAA is two-fold. First, we must determine whether the lawsuit in question is a ""qualified civil liability action."" Next, we must determine whether any of the PLCAA\'s six exceptions to this definition apply. Should the current suit fail to meet the definition of a ""qualified civil liability action"" or should any of the six exceptions apply, the plaintiff\'s claims against Glock would not automatically be dismissed. See City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 524 F.3d 384, 398-399 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1579 (2009); Ileto, supra; City of New York v.

The present suit is a ""civil action or proceeding"" brought by a ""person"" (Ryan) against a ""manufacturer"" (Glock, Inc.) for ""damages."" The parties do not dispute that the Glock pistol is a ""firearm""', 'and therefore a ""qualified product""', ""under the PLCAA. On appeal, the plaintiff argues for the first time that the allowance of Glock's motion for summary judgment should be reversed because the gun case is not a qualified product, and thus the PLCAA does not bar her suit against Glock. As this argument was not made in the trial court in the first instance, the argument is waived. See Carey v. New England Organ Bank,"", ', 285 (2006) (""The plaintiffs never put the judge on notice that they opposed summary judgment on this theory. . . . Thus, we deem the issue waived""). We express no opinion as to whether the PLCAA would preclude or permit a future plaintiff to bring claims involving the interaction between qualified and nonqualified products.', 'The final element of the definition of a ""qualified civil liability action"" is that the civil action ""result[ed] from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party."" 15 U.S.C. § 7903(5)(A). The Act defines ""unlawful misuse"" to mean ""conduct that violates a statute, ordinance, or regulation as it relates to the use of a qualified product."" 15 U.S.C. § 7903(9). The plaintiff argues that ""[t]he PLCAA is inapplicable because there was no evidence supporting the conclusion that the gun was misused, whether criminally, unlawfully or otherwise."" While it is true that no criminal charges were ever brought against Milot in connection with this incident, compare Adames v. Sheahan, 233 Ill. 2d at 309-310 (adjudication of delinquency), the PLCAA does not require a criminal conviction in order for an activity to qualify as ""criminal or', 'Page 100', 'unlawful misuse."" Id. at 310-311. Here, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), Milot possessed a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony. See notes 7 & 8, supra.', 'Since the civil action at issue here resulted from Milot\'s possession of the Glock pistol, which constituted ""criminal or unlawful misuse"" due to Milot\'s prior felony conviction, this is a ""qualified civil liability action.""', 'The plaintiff argues that even if this is a ""qualified civil liability action,"" the PLCAA should not operate to foreclose her claims against Glock because her claims fall under the PLCAA\'s ""Design Defect Exception.""', 'See Ileto, 421 F. Supp. 2d at 1283-1284 (""[a]ssuming a given action against a firearms manufacturer or dealer falls within one of these exceptions, the action can proceed""). The design defect exception provides that a ""qualified civil liability action"" does not include:', '""an action for death, physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner,', ', then such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, personal injuries or property damage"" (emphasis supplied).', '15 U.S.C. § 7903(5)(A)(v).\n\n \t      Although, as noted above, Milot was not convicted of a criminal offense in connection with this accident, ""the exception in section 7903(5)(A)(v) does not require a criminal conviction. The statute requires only that the volitional act constitute a criminal offense."" Adames, 233 Ill. 2d at 313. Here, as we have discussed, the relevant volitional act that caused the gun\'s discharge was Milot\'s unlawful possession of the Glock pistol. Milot\'s volitional act constituted a criminal offense and the design defect exception is therefore not applicable.', 'Page 101', ""Thus, for the reasons outlined above we conclude that the plaintiff's claims against Glock were barred by the PLCAA."", '', 'Judgment affirmed.']"

The judge found support for this based on the evidence that there had been no petitions filed by jail authorities for a mental health evaluation of the defendant, see G.

The defendant maintains that the confrontation clause, as interpreted in Allen, requires that the defendant, in all cases, receive a warning from the judge before removal occurs that he will be removed if his misconduct continues. See Gray v. Moore, 520 F.3d 616 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 555"", 'Page 277', 'U.S. 894 (2008).', 'Although the defendant in Allen was initially in the courtroom and was given a warning by the judge before he was removed, the Supreme Court observed that ""[n]o one formula for maintaining the appropriate courtroom atmosphere will be best in all situations."" Allen, 397 U.S. at 343. It would be inconsistent with the underpinnings of the rule in Allen to require a warning and the defendant\'s presence in the courtroom before a removal order can issue in circumstances like those in this case where the defendant threatens violence if he is brought into the courtroom and engages in disruptive behavior to prevent the judge from addressing him.', 'Here, the trial judge exercised her sound discretion by giving the defendant numerous opportunities to come into the courtroom, by providing him with access to counsel at all times, and by installing a communications system to enable him to hear the proceedings in the courtroom. After affording counsel the opportunity to question court officers and offer evidence and argument on the question of forfeiture,', 'the trial judge made adequate findings and rulings that the defendant had forfeited his right to confrontation and would not be brought into the courtroom during the trial. If, in the alternative, she had ordered the defendant to be brought into court to receive an express warning, the safety of the defendant as well as court staff would have been at risk.', 'Both the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Court have recognized that a defendant may forfeit his right to confront a witness against him ""when a judge determines that a wrongful act by the defendant made the witness unavailable to testify at trial."" Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353, 355 (2008). See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 62 (2004); Commonwealth v. Edwards,', ', 540 (2005); Commonwealth', 'Page 278', 'v. Szerlong,', "", 862-863 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1494 (2011). Recognition that a defendant may by his purposeful conduct forfeit his right to be present in court during his trial to confront the witnesses against him rests on principles of equity consistent with those underpinning the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing. See Mass. G. Evid. § 804, at 280 (2011). Forfeiture by wrongdoing requires proof that the defendant acted with the intent to procure the witness's unavailability. See Commonwealth v. Szerlong, supra. Similarly, here the trial judge found that the defendant's conduct was intentional"", 'and that it had the effect of preventing her from addressing him or safely bringing him into the courtroom.', ""The basis for this result is forfeiture, not waiver, because it does not rest on the relinquishment of a known right, but rather on the defendant's intentional misconduct. See Commonwealth v. Edwards, supra at 536 n.16. See also Commonwealth v. Means,"", ', 91 (2009) (""waiver by conduct is misconduct occurring after an express warning has been given . . .""). Just as the misconduct that is sufficient to trigger the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing does not have to be criminal, forfeiture of the right to confrontation in this context can result from the defendant\'s obdurate misconduct that puts his safety and the safety of court personnel at risk and prevents the judge from engaging him in meaningful communication.', 'This result is consistent with Illinois v. Allen, in which the Supreme Court held that one option available to a trial judge faced with a defendant who engages in flagrantly disruptive behavior in the courtroom is to remove him and proceed to trial. This result is also consistent with the doctrine of forfeiture of counsel, which recently was addressed by the Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v. Means,', ', 92-100 (2009) (Means). In Means, the court explained that ""[f]orfeiture is a method of court room management in extraordinary circumstances. The sanction of forfeiture recognizes that a defendant', 'Page 279', 'may engage in misconduct that is so serious that it may justify the loss of his right to counsel even if he was not warned that his misconduct may have that consequence. Mindful that violence by defendants can and does occur in the court room, and taking into account considerations of the fair, efficient, and orderly administration of justice, we are not prepared to deprive judges of what may be a necessary response to exigent circumstances."" Id. at 92-93.', 'Furthermore, ""forfeiture may be an appropriate response to the defendant\'s threats of violence or acts of violence against defense counsel or others."" Id. at 94, and cases cited.', 'In Means, the Supreme Judicial Court also prescribed the procedure that the trial judge should follow before invoking the doctrine of forfeiture of counsel.', 'Specifically, the defendant has the right to notice and a hearing on the issue of forfeiture of counsel:', '""[T]he defendant should be represented by counsel; if the conduct at issue is violence or threats directed at his defense counsel, separate counsel may need to be appointed for the limited purpose of representing the defendant at the forfeiture hearing. The judge should hear evidence regarding the alleged conduct that may give rise to the finding of forfeiture. The defendant should have the opportunity to offer evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses, both as to the allegations of his misconduct and the totality of the circumstances that may bear on the forfeiture finding, including his mental competency and psychological condition, any other mitigating considerations, and the willingness of appointed counsel to continue the representation.""', 'Means, supra at 97. Following the hearing, Means requires the', 'Page 280', 'judge to determine ""whether the defendant\'s conduct was so egregious as to warrant the sanction of forfeiture, and, if so, in view of the totality of circumstances, whether the sanction of forfeiture is in the interests of justice."" Ibid. The judge must make factual findings that support a forfeiture of the right to counsel. Although the right to counsel and the right to confrontation serve different purposes, Means provides useful guidance in determining whether there has been a forfeiture of the right to confrontation with the exception, for purposes of the analysis in this case, of the defendant\'s personal participation in the forfeiture hearing. The conduct of the trial judge in this case is consistent with the procedures mandated in Means and is warranted on the facts found.', ""d. Forfeiture of confrontation rights and Mass.R.Crim.P. 45. In the circumstances presented here, Mass.R.Crim.P. 45,  378 Mass. 921  (1979), has no application to the defendant's forfeiture of confrontation rights."", ""On October 9, 2009, prior to taking evidence at the trial, the trial judge ruled that rule 45 was not applicable to this case because the defendant did not disrupt proceedings in the courtroom, but instead did everything he could, including threatening violence, to remain out of the courtroom. At no time did defendant's trial counsel invoke rule 45 or make any request that the defendant be brought into the courtroom. In fact, defense counsel, whose focus was on the issue of competency, expressed the view that he preferred that the"", 'Page 281', 'defendant be kept out of the courtroom. Thus, there was no violation of rule 45.', 'Conclusion. The result we reach today is fully consonant with the precept that ""[s]ociety may justify a person\'s conviction only after a trial scrupulous in its adherence to a process which, so far as humanly possible, assures that the innocent are not mistakenly deprived of liberty."" Commonwealth v. Bergstrom,', ', 553 (1988).', ""In this case, the able Superior Court judge acted in an exemplary manner by holding hearings at which she considered both prior and contemporaneous mental health evaluations of the defendant by forensic experts along with reports from court officers and counsel, and by making detailed findings on the record that the defendant was competent to stand trial. Even then, despite the defendant's obdurate behavior, she gave him an opportunity to come into the courtroom and participate fully in his trial. When the defendant persisted in his threat to harm court officers and disrupt the proceedings if required to come into the courtroom, the trial judge made appropriate findings on the record and arrangements for an audio link between the courtroom and the defendant's cell and for the presence of a second attorney outside his cell to facilitate communication between the defendant and his trial counsel. Confrontation is unquestionably a fundamental right, but in the circumstances of this case it is unquestionable that it is a right that the defendant forfeited."", 'Judgment affirmed.']"

They are telling you that [Ross] is not believable. But he went ahead and put on witnesses."" The defendant made no objection at trial to this aspect of the closing argument.', '', 'Although the prosecutor at one point referenced some of the benefits that Ross received, he urged the jury to believe Ross because she was an ""independent eye witness"" who was not ""working for . . . the police"" and who ""wasn\'t trying to get anything from the police."" He contrasted her status with that of the alibi witnesses, whom he characterized as family members with an incentive to cover for the defendant. The defendant did not object to this. However, the defendant did request that the judge instruct the jury that they should use ""greater care"" in evaluating the testimony of any witnesses who were receiving ""promises, rewards or inducements"" in return for their testimony. The judge declined to do so, concluding that ""[p]romises, rewards and inducements"" were instead the province of argument. After the judge charged the jury without giving the requested instruction, the defendant objected on this basis.', '', 'Discussion. 1. Jury instruction. As the record in this case', 'Page 25', ""well documents, informants who are paid to make controlled purchases play an important role in the ability of the police to infiltrate the drug underworld. The dispute before us regarding the potential bias of such witnesses is a narrow one. The fact that these witnesses receive some compensation does not mean that their testimony is necessarily unreliable, and the defendant makes no argument that Ross should have been disqualified as a witness. Conversely, the Commonwealth acknowledges, as it must, that it was fair play for the defendant to argue that Ross's testimony might have been skewed by the financial benefits that she received. The narrow question before us is whether the defendant was entitled to a specific jury instruction that testimony from a witness who is paid by the government in return for her participation in the case should be subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny than testimony from other witnesses. We begin by reviewing two of the cases on which the defendant relies: Commonwealth v. Luna,"", '(1991), and Commonwealth v. Miranda,', '(2010), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 548 (2011).', '', 'Luna, supra at 138, involved an informant who was interested in obtaining a ""finder\'s fee"" in the event that an alleged drug dealer\'s house was forfeited in a pending Federal proceeding. At trial, ""[d]efense counsel fully developed the possibility that [the informant] named [the defendant] as the seller of the drugs in order to receive a reward from the sale of [the defendant\'s] forfeited house."" Id. at 138-139. The defendant there did not request a specific jury instruction on the issue, and the court held that the absence of one did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Id. at 140. However, the court declared that ""[i]n the future, a specific instruction that the jury weigh such a witness\'s testimony with care should be given on request."" Ibid.', 'Page 26', 'We turn next to Miranda, the Supreme Judicial Court\'s recent pronouncement on the subject. In Miranda, supra at 105, a local chamber of commerce had established a reward program under which it ""would pay $3,000 for information that helped lead to an indictment in an unsolved homicide, and an additional $2,000 if the information provided led to a conviction."" On appeal, the defendant claimed that his Federal and State due process rights were violated ""because two witnesses at trial were paid consideration for their testimony contingent on his conviction."" Id. at 101. The court rejected this claim, and it affirmed the convictions. Id. at 108-111. However, critical to the court\'s analysis was the existence of certain procedural safeguards, including that the judge ""instruct[ed] the jury about the heightened scrutiny to be given testimony provided under a fee payment arrangement."" Id. at 109, quoting from United States v. Levenite, 277 F.3d 454, 462 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1105 (2002).', 'After recognizing that Federal courts have required such safeguards even where the payment to the witness was not contingent on the outcome of the case,', 'the Supreme Judicial Court expressly ""adopt[ed] the Federal procedural safeguards."" Miranda, supra at 109-110.', '', 'On various grounds, the Commonwealth argues that the directives contained in Luna and Miranda do not apply here. First, it', 'Page 27', 'argues that Ross was compensated solely for working with the police and that Ross did not receive compensation to testify at trial. But that claim is inconsistent with the record. As noted above, a police officer who worked with Ross testified that informants in Ross\'s position will ""buy testify,"" which means that they ""will make controlled buys . . . under the agreement that they will give a statement and later on, if necessary, they will testify in court."" Further, the same officer testified, in reference to the time period during which Ross purchased drugs from the defendant, that Ross ""had agreed to buy testify."" Thus, the agreement between Ross and the police included a provision that Ross testify if necessary.', 'Next the Commonwealth argues that, at the time they testified, the witnesses in Luna and Miranda stood to gain financial benefits, while here the compensation was all in the past. It is certainly true that by the time she testified, Ross was no longer working for the police, her identity had been revealed, and she had received all of the compensation she could have anticipated. Nevertheless, we do not agree with the Commonwealth that the only source of potential bias here can be discounted as mere ""gratitude for past favors."" At the time Ross identified the defendant to the police, she faced a real incentive to supply information that would lead to an arrest (since she received a larger payment if that transpired).', 'Once Ross identified someone, she might feel locked into that identification even if she stood to gain no additional compensation. Notably, if someone in such a position changed her story, she might face criminal sanctions as a result. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Costa,', ', 516 & n.10 (2007) (identified informants are more reliable because they are subject to prosecution under G. L.', 'Page 28', 'c. 269, § 13A, for making a false report of a crime). In addition, the court in Miranda, 458 Mass. at 109-110, plainly expressed its view that the various procedural safeguards are required even if the compensation at issue is not conditioned on a conviction. A witness who is to be paid regardless whether there is a conviction is in a structurally similar position to one who has already been paid for her role in identifying a perpetrator.', ""We do not mean to suggest that the incentives Ross faced were as direct as those faced by the witnesses in Luna and Miranda. However, based on what the Supreme Judicial Court said in those cases, we conclude that someone in Ross's position falls within the purview of the directives issued there. Accordingly, absent further direction from the Supreme Judicial Court, we conclude that the defendant was entitled to an instruction that when a witness's testimony results from a fee arrangement with the government, that testimony must be weighed with particular care."", 'The defendant not only specifically requested an instruction along these lines, he objected to its absence when one was not given. The claim of error was therefore unquestionably preserved, and the prejudicial error standard of review applies. See Commonwealth v. Vick,', "", 423 n.5 (2009). Given that the Commonwealth's case turned on whether the jury credited Ross's identification testimony, it"", 'Page 29', 'becomes difficult to say with assurance that the error ""did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.""', 'Ibid., quoting from Commonwealth v. Stuckich,', ', 453 (2008). However, we need not decide whether the absence of the requested instruction by itself would entitle the defendant to a new trial, because there was a second error at trial to which we now turn.', 'See Commonwealth v. Andujar,', ', 532-533, 537 (2003) (although a certain error ""[s]tanding alone . . . might well fall within the ambit of cases where such an error was deemed harmless or nonprejudicial,"" that error ""appears synergistically toxic when viewed in conjunction with the prosecutor\'s"" comment on the defendant\'s silence at the time of his arrest).', ""2. Comment on the defendant's offer of evidence. As noted, the prosecutor suggested in his closing argument that the jury could conclude that the Commonwealth's case was strong, because the defendant chose to put on witnesses even though he had no obligation to do so. In defending this comment on appeal, the Commonwealth points to the fact that existing case law addresses only a prosecutor's commenting on a defendant's choice not to put on a case, not on his choice to do so. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Kozec,"", ', 516 (1987) (noting that ""a prosecutor should not refer to the defendant\'s failure to testify""). In our view, this distinction does not make a difference. ""The right to offer the testimony of witnesses . . . is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to', 'Page 30', 'present the defendant\'s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\'s to the jury so [they] may decide where the truth lies."" Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967). This right is secured by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and ""[f]ew rights are more fundamental"" to the due process of law. Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302 (1973). It was plain error for the prosecutor to disparage, or to invite the jury to draw an adverse inference from, the mere exercise of such a fundamental right. Compare Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 617-619 (1976) (commenting on defendant\'s postarrest silence); United States v. Daoud, 741 F.2d 478, 480 (1st Cir. 1984) (commenting on defendant\'s requests for counsel); Commonwealth v. Gouveia,', "", 571 (1976) (commenting on defendant's failure to testify); Commonwealth v. Person,"", "", 138-143 (1987) (commenting on defendant's decision to present his side of story only after hearing evidence against him); Commonwealth v. Beauchamp,"", "", 690-691 (1997) (commenting on defendant's discussions with attorney); Commonwealth v. Ewing,"", ', 541-542 (2006), S.C.,', ""(2007) (commenting on defendant's right to discovery and to prepare for trial)."", ""The prosecutor made his remark about the defendant's case presentation with specific reference to Ross's credibility. It thus added to the prejudice effected by the absence of a jury instruction. We conclude that the combination of preserved and unpreserved errors entitles the defendant to a new trial."", 'Compare Andujar, 57 Mass. App. Ct. at 537 (impermissible comment on', 'Page 31', ""defendant's right to remain silent, even though not preserved, warranted reversal when taken together with preserved error)."", 'Judgments reversed.', 'Verdicts set aside.']"

The incident and plaintiff's affidavit. On October 13, 2010, the plaintiff sought a restraining order against her former spouse, the defendant, following an incident involving the parties' teenage son, who was living with the plaintiff. The plaintiff got into a dispute with her son, who pushed her, and she responded by slapping him in the face. The son called the defendant, who called the local police. The police came to the plaintiff's home. For the duration of the time the police were there, the defendant, himself a police officer, sat in uniform in his police cruiser at the end of the plaintiff's street (a cul-de-sac). The police deemed the incident a minor domestic dispute and left, but not before the defendant asked them why they did not arrest the plaintiff. Shortly thereafter, on October 22, 2010, the plaintiff sought a protective order from the Probate and Family Court. The plaintiff and the defendant have three children, and the plaintiff and her fiancé had a son shortly before the hearing."", 'In the plaintiff\'s affidavit in support of the c. 209A restraining order, she recited the details of the October 13 incident and also asserted that the defendant had been physically abusive in the past, had struck her with his hand and other objects, and had placed a gun to her head. She noted that ""[b]ecause [the defendant] works for the Boston Police he carries a gun. Because of this and the past abuse I am in fear of my life."" She testified at a hearing before the judge that when her then-husband put a gun to her head, he told her that if she were to leave him he would put her ""six feet under."" She also testified that this was not the first time the defendant had sat in his police cruiser near her house in a manner that she described as ""harass[ing]."" The plaintiff had obtained at least two restraining orders prior to the one at issue, and had again averred under oath in prior proceedings that the defendant threatened to put her ""six feet under"" if she left him.

The November 9 hearing. On November 9, 2010, a hearing was held before the same judge to determine whether the ex parte order should be extended. The plaintiff appeared pro se, and the defendant appeared represented by counsel. The defendant chose not to present any evidence at the hearing, electing instead to challenge the adequacy of the plaintiff's affidavit in support of the ex parte order and her testimony at the hearing."", 'Prior to the hearing, the judge directed the parties to the probation department for an interview with a probation officer. At the hearing itself, counsel for the defendant asserted that the plaintiff\'s allegation concerning the defendant putting a gun to the plaintiff\'s head was false. He asserted that the Boston police had conducted an internal investigation ""by detectives,"" and that ""[the defendant] was cleared. His weapons were returned to him. He was put back on duty."" Defense counsel also averred that the plaintiff had never made the allegation about the gun in any of the several other restraining order proceedings brought against the defendant.', 'The judge informed the plaintiff that she was going to obtain the affidavits from those other proceedings. The plaintiff asserted that she had included the allegation in previous affidavits, to which defense counsel replied, ""I think as an officer of the court, I\'d be bound to just make a mention that, this plaintiff needs to seek counsel. She\'s getting into a Fifth Amendment issue here, because my recollection of this testimony and what she\'s offering under oath right now is starkly different.""', 'The judge concluded by saying, ""I\'m going to, during the luncheon hour, I\'m going to see if I can get the affidavits from the district court."" The judge also said, ""I\'m also going to have him [presumably a probation officer] call internal affairs. I don\'t know if there\'s any information they\'ll release . . . .""', 'Rather than objecting, defense counsel said, ""I think it may have been handled by the district detectives in [Boston police District C-11], actually, if my memory serves correctly."" The plaintiff then suggested that the judge call Boston police Sergeant Craven, a domestic abuse officer. In response, defense counsel raised another issue in regard to Sergeant Craven, asserting that', 'Page 58', 'he believed Craven may have helped the plaintiff prepare the affidavit. Reminding the plaintiff that she was testifying under oath, defense counsel asked her if Sergeant Craven ""sat down with you and did this?"" The plaintiff testified that Craven had not assisted her, and her attorney helped her with the affidavit. Apparently concerned that Craven was acting outside of her duties as a police officer if she assisted the plaintiff, defense counsel argued that the affidavit appeared to be the work of a police officer, not an attorney. Upon defense counsel\'s request, the judge gave defense counsel permission to explore the issue, and the following ensued:', 'JUDGE: ""I\'m going to have probation call Dorchester district court and get the affidavits for the prior restraining order, and any decision of the judge.

At no point did the defendant object to the procedure proposed by the judge.', 'After a recess, the judge returned. She indicated that the probation office had obtained the affidavits from the previous c. 209A proceedings.

Defense counsel noted that there was no mention of a gun. The judge agreed but noted that the affidavit ""mentions a serious threat.""', 'The judge also said, ""Probation also spoke with Sergeant Craven, who has dealt with the family for years.

Defense counsel did not, however, request an evidentiary hearing but argued that the defendant\'s original threat had occurred over one year before, and that there was no imminent threat of physical harm.', 'The judge stated that she would extend the order for one year, and defense counsel indicated that he would appeal. He noted the basis of his objection on the record, that the order was ""baseless,"" that the judge ""abus[ed] [her] discretion,"" that there was ""not an imminent matter of bodily harm or fear,"" and that the plaintiff abused the system by seeking restraining orders whenever a pleading was filed in another case and ""has stated things under oath that she\'s failed to put in an affidavit under oath.""', 'The judge said, ""Counsel, I\'m looking at what\'s on the affidavit. And I am considering what Sergeant Craven has reported to probation. . . . You have a right to disagree, and you\'re free to do so."" Finally, defense counsel said, ""Your Honor, very well. And note my objection, that Sergeant Craven has taken a role beyond that of the Boston Police department in investigating a crime. In this court -- And Your Honor, I believe this -- This order is not based on any evidence of showing of any imminent fear of bodily harm. And we\'ll address it in the appellate court.""', ""c.

Sufficiency of the evidence. The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the judge's finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff was reasonably in fear of imminent physical harm.

We affirm.', 'Factual background.', '1. The stabbing. Late in the evening of September 5, 2005, Robert DeMenzes (the victim) and his girlfriend, Kendra Anderson, were ""hanging out"" in Ruggles Park in Fall River. Earlier that evening the victim had departed from the park looking to buy marijuana from an individual named ""E.""', 'The incident at the heart of this case occurred when ""E"" and the defendant pulled up to the park in a black car with a dent on the side. At this point, the victim was quite drunk. The defendant was holding an item that Anderson at first thought was a pipe or a bat, but later ascertained was ""something teenagers now call pimp canes."" Anderson described the ""pimp cane"" as between twelve and eighteen inches long. At another point she said it was eleven inches long including the handle, admitting she was ""not really sure about the length."" The defendant began speaking in another language while advancing into the park. ""E"" was standing right behind the defendant, screaming', 'Page 241', 'that he had a gun and that everybody should ""back the F up.""', '', 'At this point, the defendant pulled the cover off the ""pimp cane,"" revealing, Anderson testified, a ""big blade"" that was about eleven inches long.', 'The defendant ran at the victim, screaming things. After a warning shout from Anderson, the victim ran from the defendant. At around the same time, Anderson jumped on the defendant\'s back and tried to pull him away from the victim. Although Anderson was somewhat successful at first, the defendant broke free and ran after the victim. The victim fell to the ground, either because he tripped or due to his intoxication, at which point the defendant caught up with him. The defendant then repeatedly stabbed the victim with the blade, through his back and arm and ""from side to side in his stomach."" The victim attempted to block these attacks with his arms, which were sliced as a result. The defendant then kicked the victim in the head three times with his sneakers. At this point, the black car came down the street and both ""E"" and the defendant jumped in. The car then drove off. The whole incident lasted less than five minutes.', 'Anderson picked the victim up and carried him to the steps of a house near the street. The victim was ""covered in blood"" and his intestines were hanging out. Something fell out of his side while they were on the steps of the house.', 'The police and an ambulance eventually arrived at the scene and took the victim to the Charlton Memorial Hospital. The doctor who treated the victim at the hospital determined that he had suffered at least three stab wounds. The victim had dried blood in a variety of areas and was described as minimally responsive and in critical condition. The doctor further stated that the victim\'s wounds were ""life-threatening."" The victim\'s blood pressure was also', 'Page 242', '""quite low,"" which, in conjunction with the stab wounds, led the doctor to believe that he had severe internal bleeding. The doctor did what he could to stabilize the victim but, due to the complexity of his injuries, decided to transfer him to the trauma center at the Rhode Island Hospital.', '2. The jailhouse recordings. The defendant was indicted on December 16, 2005, and held pending trial. While in the Bristol County house of correction, he had conversations in which he made incriminating statements. At the Bristol County house of correction, all inmate telephone calls except attorney calls were recorded pursuant to department policy. The defendant was made aware of this policy by the ""Bristol County Sheriff\'s Office Inmate Orientation, Handbook & Rules,"" a four-page document that he signed.', ""Prior to trial, the Commonwealth sent a subpoena to John Silva at the Bristol County sheriff's office, directing him to appear before the court on or before June 1, 2006,"", 'in order to ""give evidence"" regarding the defendant\'s case. See G. L. c. 277, § 68. The subpoena specifically requested that Silva bring with him any audio recordings of calls to or from the defendant from September 15, 2005, through June 1, 2006. The subpoena further requested that Silva forward an additional copy of the recordings directly to the Bristol County district attorney\'s office. On May 3, 2006, the sheriff\'s office sent the recordings to the district attorney\'s office. On June 1, the prosecution sent the recordings to the defense counsel along with other discovery materials he planned to use at trial. The recordings were accompanied by a letter indicating that the prosecutor intended to introduce the incriminating calls in evidence and that he would call Silva as a witness at trial. The trial began on October 10, 2006.', 'Discussion. 1. Possession of a dangerous weapon. a. Statutory standard. The crime of possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to G. L. c. 269, § 10(b),', 'as amended through St. 1986, c. 581, § 1, is a single offense which can be proved in one of two different ways depending on whether the defendant', 'Page 243', ""was carrying the weapon at the time of his arrest. Where, as here, the weapon is not on the defendant's person at the time of his arrest, the Commonwealth is required to prove that the defendant"", '""carrie[d] on his person . . . any stiletto, dagger, or a device or case which enables a knife with a locking blade to be drawn at a locked position, any ballistic knife, or any knife with a detachable blade capable of being propelled by any mechanism, dirk knife, any knife having a double edged blade, or a switch knife, or any knife having an automatic spring release device by which the blade is released from the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches . . . .""', 'G. L. c. 269, § 10(b). In contrast, the statute provides for an alternative mode of proof of guilt in cases in which the defendant is arrested on a warrant or for a breach of the peace and has the alleged dangerous weapon on his person at the time of arrest. In such cases, the statute provides that the defendant is guilty of a § 10(b) violation if he is ""armed with or has on his person . . . a billy or other dangerous weapon other than those herein mentioned and mentioned in paragraph (a) . . . ."" In each case, the offense is a felony punishable by up to five years in State prison. The effect of the statute\'s language is that if a person is not armed at the time of his arrest, as in this case, the Commonwealth is required to prove that the defendant possessed one of the weapons enumerated in the statute.', 'In this case, the prosecutor did not argue at trial that the weapon possessed by the defendant was one of those specific weapons enumerated in G. L. c. 269, § 10(b). However, the prosecutor argued on the defendant\'s motion for a new trial, and also argues on appeal, that the defendant\'s weapon was a ""dirk knife,"" one of the enumerated weapons in G. L. c. 269, § 10(b).', ',', 'The defendant contends that the weapon described', 'Page 244', 'by the witness falls under none of the weapons prohibited by the statute. Because we find that the weapon possessed by the defendant could not be considered a ""dirk knife"" under the statute, we explore the definitional scope both of ""dirk knife"" and of the other prohibited weapons listed in G. L. c. 269, § 10(b), in particular that of ""dagger[s]."" In so doing, we are mindful that in interpreting statutes, ""[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language,"" except where they have acquired a ""peculiar and appropriate meaning in law."" G. L. c. 4, § 6, Third. See Commonwealth v. McDowell,', ', 20 (2004).', 'We must presume that the Legislature is familiar with common-law definitions of the terms it uses in a statute.

Fortier,', ', 120 (2002).', '""If the language of the statute is \'fairly susceptible [of] a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result\' . . . we will construe [it] so \'as to make [it an] . . . effectual piece[] of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\' "" Commonwealth v. Williams,', ', 62 (1998), quoting from Commonwealth v. A Juvenile,', ', 254 (1983). However, regardless of the interpretive rule applied, any construction of a statute must give way when its observance ""would involve a construction inconsistent with the manifest', 'Page 245', 'intent of the law-making body."" Commonwealth v. Moran,', ', 11 (2011).', 'We note also, as Justice Kaplan put it in a different context, no form of words is ""self-interpreting."" Antonellis v. Northgate Constr. Corp.,', ', 851 (1973). Finally, because this is a criminal case, the statute must be construed strictly, and any ambiguity resolved in favor of the defendant. See Commonwealth v. Lupo,', ', 649 (1985).', 'The leading case in Massachusetts on the definition of ""dirk knife"" is Commonwealth v. Miller,', '(1986). That case noted that Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 642 (1971) defined a "" \'dirk knife\' [as] a \'clasp knife,\' . . . having a large blade like that of a dirk.\' "" Commonwealth v. Miller, supra at 695. This definition is consistent with the usage of the term since before the statute was enacted in 1906 (St. 1906, c. 172, § 2). See Webster\'s International Dictionary 417 (1890) (""Dirk Knife"" defined as ""[a] clasp knife having a large, dirk like blade""; ""Dirk"" defined as ""[a] kind of dagger or poniard"").', 'See also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 709 (2d ed. 1989) (defining ""dirk knife"" as ""a large clasp-knife with a dirk-shaped blade"").', ""Currently, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 642 (2002) also defines"", 'Page 246', '""dirk knife"" as a ""clasp knife having a large blade like that of a dirk."" ""Dirk"" is defined as ""a long straight blade dagger . . ."" or ""a short sword . . . .""', 'Ibid. A ""clasp knife"" is, in turn, defined as ""a large pocketknife the blade or blades of which fold or shut into the handle."" Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 416 (2002).', 'While Miller did not directly address whether a weapon must be folding in order to be considered a ""dirk knife,"" that question is central to our analysis here. Based on these definitions, we conclude that one of the prerequisites for a weapon to be considered a ""dirk knife"" is that its blade folds into its handle.', 'Daggers, however, are a class of weapons that do not have this limitation. Historically, the term ""dagger"" has been considered a ""general term"" for a ""short weapon used for stabbing"" that includes poniards, stilettos, and dirks. Webster\'s International Dictionary 365 (1890). See A Standard Dictionary of the English Language 464 (1895) (""dagger"" defined as ""[a] short edged and pointed weapon fitted primarily for stabbing; a general term covering the dirk, stiletto, poniard, etc.""). The broad scope of this term remains to this day. See Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 570 (2002); State v. Harrell, 342 S.W.3d 908, 914 (Mo. App. 2011).', '', 'As we recognized in Miller, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 696, the legislative purpose of G. L. c. 269, § 10, was ""to outlaw the carrying of those knives which are primarily designed for stabbing', 'Page 247', 'human beings or for other unlawful objectives.""', 'Other jurisdictions, perhaps recognizing a similar legislative intent, have interpreted the term ""dagger"" to mean a blade that, by design, is intended for stabbing. See People v. Pettway, 233 Cal. App. 3d 1067, 1069-1070 (1991) (""Dirk and dagger are used synonymously and consist of any straight stabbing weapon . . . . They may consist of any weapon fitted primarily for stabbing"");', 'State v. Giltner, 56 Haw. 374, 375 (1975) (dagger as used in statute prohibiting carrying certain dangerous weapons defined as ""a short weapon used for stabbing""); Huebner v. State, 103 Nev. 29, 30 n.1 (1987) (""a dagger is a short weapon used for thrusting and stabbing""); State v. Pruett, 37 Or. App. 183, 187 (1978) (Joseph, J., concurring) (""Dirks and daggers are designed and are useful almost exclusively for stabbing""); Thompson v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 280, 290 (Va. 2009) (""A \'dagger\' is \'a short knife used for stabbing\' ""). In light of the long-standing definitions of the terms and of the purpose of G. L. c. 269, § 10(b), we recognize that, under that section, a dagger is any blade of relatively short length primarily designed or modified for stabbing. This definition excludes common household items such as a steak knife which are designed primarily for utilitarian purposes.', '', 'b. Sufficiency of the evidence. We determine sufficiency of the evidence under the familiar standard, ""whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,', 'Page 248', '', 'rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt"" (emphasis in original). Commonwealth v. Nee,', ', 180 (2010), quoting from Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 677 (1979). Contrary to the Commonwealth\'s contention, there was not sufficient evidence that the weapon in question is a ""dirk knife"" under G. L. c. 269, § 10(b).', 'As outlined supra, a ""dirk knife"" is, by definition, a weapon in which the blade folds into the handle. No evidence was presented to suggest that the blade of the weapon possessed by the defendant folded into its handle.', 'However, sufficient evidence was presented to the jury to find that the weapon possessed by the defendant was a ""dagger"" under G. L. c. 269, § 10(b). See Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe,', ', 102 (1997) (appellate court free to affirm ruling on grounds different from those relied on by motion judge). As noted supra, ""dagger"" is a general term that refers to a relatively short weapon primarily designed for stabbing. The weapon possessed by the defendant was described as a ""big blade"" which with the handle measured ""eleven inches."" The blade was contained in what initially appeared to be a ""pipe or a bat"" that was ""[b]etween twelve and eighteen inches"" in length, but which the witness later realized was a ""pimp cane."" That the blade could be held within a cane leads to a strong inference that it was a slim blade.', 'Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a rational trier of fact could find that the blade was a ""dagger"" under G. L. c. 269, § 10(b). The efficacy of the weapon at stabbing was graphically and tragically demonstrated by the stab wounds sustained by the victim in this case. That the weapon was designed for stabbing is buttressed by the inference that it was a relatively slim weapon. The defendant has suggested no alternative innocuous usage for the weapon, nor is', 'Page 249', 'one apparent. A rational jury could easily conclude that the weapon possessed by the defendant was designed primarily for stabbing.', 'Nor is the blade too long to be considered a dagger. While the blade in question was referred to by the witness and the Commonwealth as a ""sword,"" this does not preclude it from being considered a ""dagger"" under the statute. There is not a bright line dividing longer daggers and shorter swords. See 3 Oxford English Dictionary 7 (1978) (defining dagger as ""[a] short . . . weapon, like a small sword, used for thrusting and stabbing""); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 364 (1973) (defining dagger as ""a short, swordlike weapon""); State v. Leatherman, 100 Wash. App. 318, 323 (2000) (pointing out one of dictionary definitions of ""dagger"" also ""a weapon resembling a short sword"").', 'Our decision not to artificially create such a bright line is consistent with the legislative purpose, noted supra, of outlawing the possession of weapons primarily designed for stabbing human beings. The weapon in this case is not so long as to fall outside the realm of daggers. Thus, a rational jury could conclude that the weapon in question had all of the characteristics of a dagger.', '', 'c. Improper jury instruction. The jury were improperly instructed on the elements of possession of a dangerous weapon where the weapon was not found on the defendant at the time of the arrest. The judge defined ""dangerous weapon"" in this instruction by referring to an earlier instruction in the context of the elements of mayhem. That earlier instruction, properly in that context, stated that the jury had to find that an item is ""inherently dangerous because it can be readily used to cause death or great bodily harm"" for it to qualify as a dangerous weapon for the purposes of mayhem. See Commonwealth v.', 'Page 250', 'Farrell,', ', 614-615 (1948). The instruction was, however, not correct on the charge of possession of a dangerous weapon under G. L. c. 269, § 10(b), as it did not require the jury to determine whether the sword possessed by the defendant fell within one of the categories of weapons outlined in G. L. c. 269, § 10(b).', 'Because there was no objection to the jury instruction below, we review to determine whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See Commonwealth v. Belcher,', ', 696 (2006). Generally, there is not a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice where an improper jury instruction concerned an element that the defendant did not contest at trial because he pursued a defense of misidentification. Commonwealth v. Robinson,', ', 107 (2005), citing Commonwealth v. Jenkins,', ', 292 (1999). Here, the defendant chose to pursue a defense based on misidentification and did not contest that the weapon in question was a dangerous weapon prohibited by G. L. c. 269, § 10(b). In these circumstances, given that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the ""pimp cane"" described by the witness was a dangerous weapon under the statute, there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.', ""2. Sufficiency of evidence of mayhem. The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence of the severity of the victim's wounds for a rational jury to convict him of the crime of mayhem. The crime of mayhem may be satisfied by a showing under one of two theories. Commonwealth v. Ogden O.,"", ', 800 (2007). The Commonwealth may prove the crime of mayhem under the second theory by showing that a person, ""with intent to maim or disfigure, assaults another person with a dangerous weapon, substance or chemical, and by such assault disfigures, cripples or inflicts serious or permanent physical injury upon such person."" Ibid., quoting from G. L. c. 265, § 14. The victim in this case was described by an eyewitness as covered in blood with his intestines hanging out. In addition, he was in critical condition when he arrived at the Charlton Memorial Hospital, his wounds were described as ""life threatening,"" and the doctor inferred that he had severe internal bleeding. There is no doubt that, under the standard of Latimore, 378 Mass. at 676-678, a', 'Page 251', 'rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that such wounds constituted ""serious . . . physical injury."" G. L. c. 265, § 14.', '3. Effective assistance of counsel. The defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress the defendant\'s telephone statements made while in pretrial detention. To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) ""serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel -- behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer"" and, if that is found, (2) that this ineffectiveness ""likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence."" Commonwealth v. Dodgson,', ', 315 (2011), quoting from Commonwealth v. Saferian,', ', 96 (1974).', 'In 2009, the Supreme Judicial Court held in Commonwealth v. Odgren,', ', 172 (2009) (Odgren), that the Commonwealth may not subpoena the production of records from a third party in advance of a trial or an evidentiary hearing under the authority granted by G. L. c. 277, § 68, without first obtaining judicial approval pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 17(a)(2),  378 Mass. 886  (1979), as construed by Commonwealth v. Lampron,', "", 268- 271 (2004). See Mass.G.Evid. § 1108 (2012). It is uncontested that the Commonwealth violated the rule in Odgren by not seeking judicial approval under Mass.R.Crim.P. 17(a)(2) for issuing a subpoena, in advance of trial, for the recordings of the defendant's telephone calls made during his pretrial detention."", 'However, the defendant\'s trial ended in October of 2006, three years prior to the Odgren decision. The practice overruled by Odgren was apparently commonly used before it was found to be unlawful. See Odgren, 455 Mass. at 173 n.5 (correction facility\'s telephone system administrator had received ""thousands"" of such subpoenas from various district', 'Page 252', ""attorney's offices over ten-year period)."", 'Thus, it is doubtful that the defense attorney\'s failure to move for suppression of the materials in this case was conduct falling ""measurably below"" that expected from an ordinary, fallible lawyer.', 'Even were that the case, the defendant has not shown a likelihood that such a motion would have succeeded. While Odgren did not preclude the possibility of suppression for an improperly issued subpoena, it found two reasons that suppression was not warranted in that case, both of which are applicable here. See id. at 187-188. Just as in Odgren, the defendant here has not shown a violation of a constitutional right that would warrant suppression. See id. at 188. In addition, the defendant here was provided copies of the subpoenaed recordings well before trial, much like in Odgren, and thus cannot show prejudice in his ability to prepare for trial that would warrant suppression. See ibid.', 'The defendant was thus not likely deprived of a substantial ground of defense by any misstep his lawyer may have made.', '4. Missing witness instruction. The defendant alleges that the judge\'s decision not to give a missing witness instruction due to the victim\'s failure to testify was manifestly unreasonable. ""The decision whether to provide a missing witness instruction to the jury is within the discretion of the trial judge, and will not be reversed unless the decision was manifestly unreasonable."" Commonwealth v. Saletino,', ', 667 (2007).', 'For a missing witness instruction to be appropriate, a party who', 'Page 253', 'has failed to call a witness must ""ha[ve] knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case."" Id. at 667-668, quoting from Commonwealth v. Anderson,', ', 280 n.1 (1991). Commonwealth v. Figueroa,', ', 199 (1992). See Mass.G.Evid. § 1111 (2012). The prosecutor indicated that the Commonwealth had made ""every effort"" to locate the victim but was unable to do so. The defendant has not shown the trial judge\'s acceptance of this claim to be manifestly unreasonable. The judge thus properly determined that the victim could not be located and that a missing witness instruction would have been improper.', 'Conclusion. There was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that the weapon possessed by the defendant fell within the definition of a ""dagger"" under G. L. c. 269, § 10(b). While the jury instructions regarding what constitutes a dangerous weapon for the crime of possession of a dangerous weapon where the weapon was not found on the defendant\'s person at the time of arrest were clearly erroneous, we find no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice given the defendant\'s failure to contest the issue. None of the defendant\'s remaining contentions has merit. The defendant\'s convictions and the denial of the defendant\'s motion for a new trial are affirmed.', 'Judgments affirmed.', 'Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.']"

This case arises after searches conducted pursuant to search warrants by the police of two properties in Lawrence owned by the defendant: 63 Bromfield Street (Bromfield Street) (a house that the defendant was renovating), and 109 Union Street (Union Street) (where the defendant resided). The police relied on an informant, Stephen Cook, to obtain the search warrants. Cook became an informant after being arrested for trafficking in cocaine, which he alleged he had received from the defendant.', 'On November 7, 2007, Cook participated in a controlled ""buy"" at Bromfield Street, after which Cook turned over 189.19 grams of cocaine to the police.', 'Shortly thereafter', 'Page 577', 'the police searched Bromfield Street and found the defendant and his cousins, Jean Guillaume and Luis Alcantara.

Hampton,', ', 168-169 (2010).', ""3. Cross-examination of Cook and police officer. At trial the defendant sought to show that Cook's girlfriend, Stella Cleghorn, was involved in his cocaine trafficking charges to demonstrate Cook's bias and motive to fabricate testimony to protect her. Cook was charged based on cocaine recovered during a search of the residence of Cleghorn's sister, where Cook and Cleghorn were staying. Lieutenant Hughes participated in the search. The defendant contends that the judge improperly limited defense questioning of Cook and Hughes regarding Cleghorn. During cross-examination of Cook, defense counsel asked whether Cook discussed the cocaine with Cleghorn, whether she agreed to allow it on the premises, and whether her sister gave permission to store the cocaine there. On cross-examination of Hughes, defense counsel asked whether Cleghorn was a target of the search warrant for the premises. The judge sustained the Commonwealth's objections on each question."", 'While a judge may not ""bar', 'inquiry"" (emphasis added) into the possibility of bias, Commonwealth v. Avalos,', ', 7 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. Allison,', ', 681 (2001), a judge nevertheless has discretion to determine whether the evidence demonstrates bias and ""to limit cross-examination concerning possible bias when further questioning would be redundant."" Ibid., and cases cited. Here, the defense was permitted to elicit testimony from Cook that Cleghorn weighed and separated the cocaine into smaller bags for sale,', 'Page 580', 'that she was charged as an accessory, and that this charge was dismissed. The defense also elicited from Hughes that, during the search, Cleghorn told him where the cocaine was stored.', ""The judge did not abuse her discretion. This information enabled the defendant to challenge Cook's motive and credibility in the closing argument."", '4. Jury instruction on the absence of the codefendant. The defendant was tried along with his codefendant and cousin, Jean Guillaume. Prior to the start of a regular trial day, Guillaume was taken to the hospital and the judge suspended trial for the day. The judge learned the following morning that Guillaume had died. The parties disagreed about whether the judge should tell the jury that Guillaume had passed away or give a ""neutral"" instruction that he simply was no longer there. Over the defendant\'s objection, and at the request of the Commonwealth, the judge gave the following instruction: ""I\'m sure you\'ll notice, without my drawing attention to it, that . . . the other defendant, Jean Guillaume, [and his attorney] are not here. You are not to speculate as to why they\'re not here. And it is of no relevance with respect to the case against the [d]efendant.""', 'Defense counsel argued that the instruction would likely cause jurors to conclude that Guillaume had fled or entered a plea, unfairly prejudicing the defendant. See Commonwealth v. Muckle,', ', 636 (2003), quoting from Commonwealth v. Kane,', ', 136 (1984) (""a \'jury may raise very damaging inferences from the bare fact that the defendant has somehow flown\' ""). The prosecutor contended that the instruction was fair to both parties and was necessary to avoid prejudicing the Commonwealth. He feared that the defendant\'s close relationship with Guillaume might engender sympathy for the defendant, who was scheduled to take the witness stand next.', 'Such neutral jury instructions have been upheld in situations where the defendant faced a similar risk of prejudice. See Commonwealth v. Pasciuti,', 'Page 581', '', ', 839-840 (1981) (where the codefendant pleaded guilty, a neutral instruction that the ""indictment against [the codefendant] is being withdrawn from further consideration by the jury"" was appropriate); Commonwealth v. Kalhauser,', ', 347 (2001) (judge instructed the jury that the indictment on one of the charges against the defendant had been withdrawn); Muckle, 59 Mass. App. Ct. at 635 (where the codefendant failed to appear for trial, the judge gave a neutral instruction that the codefendant was ""not present""). We discern no error here.', ""5. Jury instructions on the trafficking charge. The Commonwealth combined the two amounts of cocaine recovered in this case, 189.19 grams from the Bromfield Street controlled buy and 15.22 grams from the defendant's Union Street residence, in one trafficking charge. At the close of trial, the judge instructed the jury on the trafficking in cocaine charge in three quantities: fourteen grams and over, 100 grams and over, and 200 grams and over. The judge also charged the jury on the lesser included offense of simple possession. The jury convicted the defendant of trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine, necessarily aggregating the two amounts."", ""On appeal, the defendant contends that in order to convict the defendant of trafficking in over 200 grams, the jury were required to find that the defendant intended to distribute cocaine from each amount. More importantly, he argues, if they credited the defendant's testimony that the smaller amount was for personal use, they could only convict him of trafficking in 100 grams or more. He claims error in the judge's failure to so instruct the jury."", 'Defense counsel did not make this argument in his closing, request an instruction to this effect, or object to the jury charge. We therefore review under the familiar standard for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See Commonwealth v. Freeman,', ', 563-564 (1967); Commonwealth v. Randolph,', ', 297-298 (2002).', 'Page 582', 'The judge gave an extensive instruction on the elements of trafficking in a controlled substance, including that the jury must find that the defendant ""had the specific intent to distribute the controlled substance."" The instruction, in pertinent part, is set out in the margin.', 'The judge added, appropriately, that', 'Page 583', '""[t]he Commonwealth need not prove the defendant specifically intended to distribute all of it.""', 'The Commonwealth may combine ""two quantities of a specified controlled substance possessed by a defendant at different locations in order to prosecute him on a more serious offense under G. L. c. 94C, § 32E."" Commonwealth v. Ortiz,', ', 138 (2000). The Commonwealth need not prove intent to distribute the entire amount of the controlled substance. See Commonwealth v. Tata,', ', 25 (1989); Commonwealth v. Gonzalez,', ', 882 (2006). The defendant now argues, however, that when the substance is found in multiple locations, the Commonwealth must prove intent to distribute some amount from each location in order to convict the defendant in trafficking the combined amount.', 'We are not persuaded that it was error for the judge to give the standard instruction on trafficking in a controlled substance, particularly where, as here, it would require the judge, sua sponte, to raise the issue of the effect of divergent intent on aggregation of amounts.', 'Even were we to find error, it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. ""A substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice exists when we have \'a serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error not been made.\' "" Randolph, 438 Mass. at 297, quoting from Commonwealth v. Azar,', ', 687 (2002). ""Errors of this magnitude are extraordinary events and relief is seldom granted."" Ibid. In our analysis, ""[w]e review the evidence and the case as a whole."" Id. at 297-298, quoting from Azar, 435 Mass. at 687.', 'The Commonwealth\'s case hinged on Cook\'s testimony. Cook testified that he first received cocaine from the defendant in lieu of $2,000 for work he performed at Bromfield Street. He next received cocaine from the defendant during the controlled buy. During the buy, Cook entered Bromfield Street before the defendant. The defendant subsequently entered and, after making telephone calls, told Cook that ""the guy was on his way."" After', 'Page 584', 'hearing a car horn in the driveway, the defendant and Guillaume went outside. They returned with Alcantara. The defendant was holding a scale, and Guillaume handed the defendant a paper bag containing cocaine. The defendant weighed the cocaine and then told Cook that ""he ha[d] more at his house, but it\'s not as good a quality. . . . But if the guy wanted it, . . . he would get it from his house and give it to [Cook]."" As noted above, the police found a digital scale at Union Street. Cook left Bromfield Street and turned over what was later shown to be 189.19 grams of cocaine to the police.', 'The defendant offered a different version of events from Cook. He testified that he was a recreational user of cocaine and possessed the smaller amount of cocaine and the digital scale recovered from Union Street for personal use. He never offered cocaine to Cook to settle a debt, and in fact Cook had offered to sell him cocaine. Although he was present at Bromfield Street at the time of the alleged controlled buy, he did not know of or observe any cocaine distribution. The defendant sent Guillaume out alone to bring Alcantara inside, and Cook left abruptly after they returned. The defendant was not aware of the scale until the police pointed it out to him during the search.', 'The jury convicted the defendant of trafficking in over 200 grams of cocaine. They were instructed that to convict based on this weight, they had to find that the defendant possessed over 200 grams (i.e., both amounts of cocaine),', 'and intended to distribute at least some part of it. It is clear from the verdict', 'Page 585', ""that the jury credited Cook's testimony over that of the defendant, who disclaimed possession of the larger amount and any intent to distribute."", ""The defendant appears to argue that it is not clear from the verdict whether the jury believed Cook's testimony that the defendant offered to get him additional cocaine from Union Street (and thus that the defendant intended to distribute the smaller amount). Given that the jury otherwise credited Cook's testimony, we are not persuaded that there is a serious doubt whether the jury also credited Cook on the single issue of the defendant's offer to provide additional cocaine from Union Street. We conclude that any error in failing to instruct the jury on intent with respect to the individual amounts did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice."", '', 'Judgments affirmed.']"

Latimore, 378 Mass. at 677-678, the trial judge could have found the following facts: On September 30, 2009, Springfield police Officer William Lopes, an experienced narcotics investigator, received information', 'that the defendant, who was wanted on an outstanding warrant, was in the general area of 585 Wilbraham Road in Springfield.', 'After receiving this information at the start of his 4:00 P.M. to 12:00 A.M. shift, Lopes drove to the area in an unmarked police cruiser.', 'Lopes initially drove to the intersection of Bristol Street and Wilbraham Road, then expanded his search to include the Daily Mart convenience store and gasoline station at the intersection of Alden Street and Wilbraham Road a short distance away. He arrived at that location at or around 5:00 P.M. After circling around the parking lots of the Daily Mart and gasoline station, Lopes, with the aid of a photograph, observed the defendant standing with a small group of three to five males outside the Daily Mart. Lopes radioed for backup to assist him with the arrest. As Lopes waited for other officers to arrive, an individual who was not the defendant suddenly left the group and conducted what Lopes observed to be a drug transaction through the window of a vehicle, in plain view of the group of men and Lopes. This individual then walked back to the group. The group, including the defendant, then walked together into the Daily Mart. Officer Lopes, and seven to ten', 'Page 767', 'other officers who had responded to his call, entered the store and placed the defendant under arrest.', '', ""Springfield police Officer John Wadlegger, who had responded to the scene in an unmarked police cruiser, transported the defendant to the police station. Before driving to the station, and based on the defendant's movements while in the backseat of the cruiser, Wadlegger searched the defendant. Inside the center pocket of the defendant's gray hooded sweatshirt, Wadlegger found three rocks of what appeared to be crack cocaine, each inside a small plastic baggie twisted off near the corner. A chemist later testified that one of the rocks was weighed and tested positive for cocaine. Wadlegger also found $312 in United States currency in the defendant's pants pocket."", 'Wadlegger, like Lopes, was an experienced narcotics investigator. He testified that he found no smoking apparatus on the defendant, and that, in his experience stopping users of either cocaine or heroin, he usually found something on their person to ingest the drug. Wadlegger testified that not every user was arrested with a smoking apparatus but stated that such a circumstance was the exception to the very general rule. He testified that the packaging of the drugs found on the defendant was consistent with the street-level sale of narcotics, and that the total street value of the drugs was around $60. Wadlegger testified that the absence of any device to ingest the drug, the packaging of the cocaine, and the nature of the area where the defendant was arrested were consistent with possession with the intent to distribute the drugs.', 'Discussion. In considering whether a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty is proper, ""[w]e review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether \'', 'rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\' "" (emphasis original).

Commonwealth v. Tavernier,', ', 355 (2010). The defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the possession element, but argues that evidence of the essential element of his intent to distribute was lacking. In this case, the defendant\'s intent to distribute ""is a matter of fact, which may not be susceptible of proof by direct evidence. In that event resort must be had . . . by inference from all the facts and circumstances . . . ."" Commonwealth v. Keefner,', ', 517 (2012) (Keefner), quoting from Commonwealth v.

Gonzales,', ', 731 (1992) (Gonzales), we ruled that although the defendant was arrested with only .32 grams of heroin, ""[t]he fact that the amount of drugs seized was small does not, by itself, require a finding of not guilty to so much of the indictment as states \'intent to distribute.\' A dealer\'s inventory of drugs may have been reduced before his arrest to a small amount by a number of sales.""', 'In Gonzales, the conviction of possession with intent to distribute was affirmed based on factors that included the packaging of the .32 grams of heroin in ten glassine packets, which according to expert testimony was ""consistent with distribution rather than personal use,"" the presence of a ""scorpion"" mark on each of the bags that was indicative of a dealer\'s brand name, and the defendant\'s possession of $167 in cash, despite being unemployed. Ibid. In this case, as in Gonzales, although the approximately .4 grams Sepheus possessed would not alone support a finding of intent to distribute, sufficient additional evidence was presented at trial that ultimately supports such a finding.', ""Additional evidence. Several factors have been acknowledged by this court and the Supreme Judicial Court to be probative, while not individually dispositive, of a defendant's intent to distribute.

The defendant also possessed no device with which to smoke or otherwise ingest the rocks of cocaine, and was arrested with $312 in cash on his person.', 'Furthermore, Officer Lopes testified that the area around the Daily Mart was ""a high crime area"" that has seen ""numerous violations and arrests for narcotics, shootings, stabbings, [and] other violent offenses."" Although the amount of contraband possessed by the defendant differs in each case, similar ""plus factors"" have contributed to the upholding of several past convictions for possession with intent to distribute. See Gonzales, supra; Gollman, supra, Wilson, supra.', 'Furthermore, the circumstances in which the police encountered Sepheus and his conduct prior to his arrest could have properly been considered by the judge as additional evidence supporting an inference of intent to distribute.

Dessources,', ', 238 (2009) (where marijuana packaged for sale was found on the defendant, conviction of possession with intent to distribute was affirmed in part because the arresting officer ""observed three other individuals seated near the defendant passing a pipe commonly used to smoke marijuana""). Here, the defendant was observed standing with a group of men that included an individual whom Officer Lopes observed conduct a ""drug transaction"" through the window of a vehicle. Sepheus was subsequently seen walking with that same group of men into the Daily Mart. The judge also could have properly inferred that Sepheus had been located in the general area of his arrest', 'from at least about 4:00 P.M., the time the officers received the information regarding his whereabouts, to approximately 5:00 P.M., the time of his arrest.', 'The judge could have reasonably concluded that a user would not likely remain at the point of purchase for such an extended period of time.', '', 'Page 771', ""The dissent states that the Commonwealth's evidence here is equally probative of innocence as it is of guilt. More specifically, it argues that the evidence supports an inference that Sepheus was a drug buyer as much as it supports an inference that he was a drug seller, and that to conclude the latter requires an impermissible speculative leap."", 'We do not agree. Considering, as we must, ""all the facts and circumstances,"" Keefner, 461 Mass. at 517, and the proper inferences to be drawn from such facts and circumstances, we conclude that an individual arrested in possession of crack cocaine packaged for sale, with an amount of cash in excess of $300 in his pocket, in possession of no apparatus to ingest the drug, who was first observed standing in an area known for narcotics trafficking in a group that included an individual whom an arresting officer observed make a drug transaction, is more likely to be a seller than a buyer of crack cocaine.

In this case, Officer Wadlegger testified that the crack cocaine found on Sepheus suggested that he was a distributor as opposed to a buyer of drugs, and the officer based this opinion on, inter alia, the manner in which the drugs were packaged, the absence of smoking paraphernalia, and the high incidence of crime in the area where Sepheus was arrested.', ',', ',', ""The judge could have properly considered Wadlegger's testimony to support an inference of an intent to distribute.

Further, the judge could have inferred that the defendant had been located in an area known for drug sales for at least an hour, and was in the company of an individual who conducted a drug transaction in his presence. The inference of an intent to distribute based on these facts and circumstances is both ""reasonable and possible,"" Commonwealth v.

The judgment is affirmed.', 'So ordered.', '', '. I write separately for two reasons. First, I want to note my disagreement with the conclusion the majority opinion draws with respect to how long the defendant had been at the gasoline station. Even reading the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the most that could be said is that the police had information that -- an hour before they found the defendant at the Daily Mart convenience store and gasoline station -- the defendant reportedly was somewhere in the general vicinity.', 'That fact has no bearing whatsoever on the question whether the defendant intended to distribute the drugs found on him.', 'Second, I want to note my discomfort with the extent to which the Commonwealth has sought to rely on opinion testimony to prove the ultimate factual issue in dispute. Such efforts are particularly troubling in light of the fact that the police expert here acknowledged that he formed his opinion ""predominantly"" based on facts that never came into evidence, that were not independently admissible, and that were of questionable reliability. Nevertheless, the only issue the defendant has raised on appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence, and -- on that narrow question -- I ultimately agree that the evidence was sufficient (if barely so). See Commonwealth v. Farnsworth, 76 Mass. App. 87, 98-99 (2010) (sufficiency of evidence ""is to be measured upon that which was admitted in evidence without regard to the propriety of the admission"").', 'Page 774', '', '. ""Facts are stubborn things, and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.""', '', 'The Commonwealth\'s case consists of evidence that the defendant had possession of three plastic ""twists,"" each containing a small rock of ""crack"" cocaine,', ""along with $312 in United States currency, in unknown denominations. Based on this evidence, and conjecture from evidence that is as probative of possession for personal use as it is of possession with intent to distribute, the majority concludes that the judge below was correct in denying the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty on so much of the indictment as charged possession with the intent to distribute. This result finds no support in any previous decision by this court or the Supreme Judicial Court, and is incompatible with the constitutionally based standard, enunciated in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979), and Commonwealth v. Latimore,"", ', 678 (1978), by which we must test sufficiency of the evidence claims like the one presented in this case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.', ""1. The evidence. I disagree with my colleagues in the majority about what evidence was available for the judge's consideration."", 'First, while it is true that this case originated with a tip from an informant,', 'the contents of the tip were not admitted for the truth of the matters asserted, and thus cannot supply the basis for an inference that the defendant was in the general area where he was arrested from between 4:00 P.M. and 5:00 P.M.', 'Compare ante at 770.', 'Page 775', ""Second, the police observations of the defendant's conduct prior to his arrest took place over the span of a minute or two at the most."", 'Compare ante at 770.', 'Third, while it is true that another man with whom the defendant was standing when he was first seen by the police was observed to make what appeared to be a hand-to-hand sale of', 'Page 776', 'drugs to someone in a motor vehicle, there is no evidence linking the defendant to this other person.', 'Compare ante at 770.', 'Fourth, Officer Wadlegger\'s contribution as an expert witness was very limited, and, for reasons discussed infra, of dubious validity. The record indicates he offered only two opinions relating to the central issue of the defendant\'s intent: (1) that the drugs possessed by the defendant were packaged and of a size ""consistent with street level sale""; and (2) that the absence of a pipe or implement for smoking crack cocaine on the defendant\'s person indicated he was ""not a user."" He did not opine about the significance of the money found in the defendant\'s pocket. Neither did he opine that the defendant\'s proximity to a drug sale had significance, or that the defendant\'s movements were indicative of a joint venture. Furthermore, on cross-examination, he made concessions that undermined the probative value of his other opinions.', 'However, of special significance is Officer Wadlegger\'s admission on cross-examination that his opinion that the defendant was a drug dealer was based ""predominantly on information that was supplied by outside sources.""', 'For the reasons discussed infra, this concession calls into question the probative value of his expert witness testimony.', 'Page 777', '2. Unreasonable factual inferences. The Commonwealth may satisfy the Jackson-Latimore due process standard based on reasonable inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence. See Commonwealth v. Degro,', ', 325 (2000). It is only necessary that the inferences drawn from the facts be reasonable and possible. Commonwealth v. Montecalvo,', ', 54 (1975). However, when the relationship between the facts and the inferences drawn from those facts is not one that a rational person would regard as reasonable, inference crosses over into the realm of conjecture. See James v. United States, 39 A.3d 1262, 1269 (D.C. 2012).', '', ""Here at least two of the factual elements of the case relied upon by the majority do not support an inference that is more consistent with the defendant's guilt than his innocence on so much of the indictment as charges possession with the intent to distribute."", 'a. Defendant\'s presence in a high crime area. As noted above, the majority\'s observation that the judge could have inferred that the defendant was in the vicinity of the Daily Mart and gasoline station ""from at least about 4:00 P.M., the time the officers received the information regarding his whereabouts, to approximately 5:00 P.M., the time of his arrest,"" ante at 770, is not supported by the record. The only way such an inference could be drawn is to accept as credible the content of the', 'Page 778', ""informant's tip. However, the judge did not admit this evidence for its truth. A fair reading of Officer Lopes's testimony is that no more than a minute or two elapsed from when the defendant was first spotted at the Daily Mart until he was arrested inside the store. Prior to this, the whereabouts and activity of the defendant were unknown, and the whereabouts and activity of Dwayne Griffiths, see note 6, supra, were unknown."", ""Thus, in this case, the mere fact that the defendant was present in a so-called high crime area sheds no light on whether the defendant's criminal activity consisted of unlawful possession or of unlawful possession with the intent to distribute, for obviously such locations are where both buyers and sellers of drugs congregate."", 'Contrast Commonwealth v. Rivera,', ', 648-649 (1997) (police officers observed defendant make several hand-to-hand exchanges; evidence that incidents were in ""an area known for drug dealing"" buttressed inference that the observed transactions were drug deals).', ""b. Defendant's proximity to a person who sold drugs. The evidence also is not sufficient to permit the fact finder to infer a connection between the defendant and Dwayne Griffiths, who was observed to sell drugs -- that is, there is no evidence on which to base an inference that because Griffiths engaged in a drug sale, the defendant intended to do so also. See ante at 770. As noted above, the evidence is that the defendant was observed in the presence of Dwayne Griffiths for only a minute or two."", 'Page 779', 'There is no evidence of what the defendant or Dwayne Griffiths was doing, or even whether they were in proximity to each other, before the brief observation made by Officer Lopes. The only way to establish an association between the two is to engage in conjecture and speculation, because mere presence at the scene where a crime is committed is not probative of guilt.', '""Indeed, [even] presence with knowledge of the planned act is insufficient alone to be the basis of a conviction of a person for the acts of another."" Commonwealth v. Casale,', ', 173 (1980). See also Commonwealth v. Perry,', ', 151 (1970) (""There was evidence that the defendant knew the three persons who entered the liquor store and committed the robbery and assault, that he associated with them, and that he was in their company both before and after the robbery. But that, without more, is not enough to convict the defendant on either charge. There can be no finding of guilt by association""). Even less does the evidence here permit an inference that the defendant himself intended to commit the same act as another person merely because they were standing in a group together for a minute or two.', 'The ability to distinguish between the possession of drugs for the purpose of distribution and possession for personal use ""is not a matter within the common experience of [fact finders].""', 'Page 780', 'Commonwealth v. Little,', ', 769 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. Grissett,', "", 457 (2006). The majority tries to have it both ways; it attaches significance to an expert opinion because nonexperts would not understand possession with intent to distribute, while simultaneously asserting, based solely on its own, nonexpert intuition, that the defendant's proximity to a person who sold drugs once in his presence is indicative of his own intent to distribute."", '3. The absence of traditional factors considered probative of an intent to distribute. a. Quantity of drugs. The quantity of cocaine possessed by the defendant (approximately .4 grams) is not an amount that alone may raise an inference of an intent to distribute. See note 15, infra; Commonwealth v. Acosta,', ', 840-841 (2012) (3.16 grams of cocaine not a sufficient quantity to alone raise inference of intent to distribute).', ""Further, none of the traditional factors that allow a reasonable inference to be drawn that a defendant's possession of a small quantity of drugs was, nonetheless, with the intent to distribute are present in this case."", 'b. Packaging of the drugs. The testimony by Officer Wadlegger that the size and packaging of the three twists of crack cocaine found in the defendant\'s pocket was consistent with ""street level sale"" is not probative of intent to distribute as opposed to possession for personal use. See Commonwealth v. Acosta, supra at 841 (""Nor was there anything distinctive or unique about the five twist bags [of cocaine] to indicate they were intended for transfer or sale as opposed to personal use""). There was no expert testimony or other evidence that purchasers of street-level quantities of drugs alter the packaging of the drugs upon receipt. Further, there was no expert testimony or other evidence suggesting that drugs purchased on the street are consumed immediately after they are purchased or within any particular period of time. The reasoning employed by Officer Wadlegger in recommending that the fact finder draw an inference that the defendant intended to sell the drugs rather than possess them for personal use on the basis of such evidence is nothing more than ""speculation based upon a generalization."" Commonwealth v. Murphy,', ', 18 (1993).', 'Page 781', 'The mere fact that an expert states such speculation as an opinion does not make it any less speculative.', 'c. Conduct of the defendant. In other cases involving small quantities of drugs, the circumstances in which the police encounter the defendant can signal whether his role is as a seller or a user. In Commonwealth v. Burke,', ', 76-77, 79 80 (1997), the police observed the defendant holding a clear plastic envelope containing a white powder, while the person he was conversing with took some currency out of his pocket. When the defendant saw the police approaching, he yelled ""cops"" and tried to flee. He was subdued by the police, who found the plastic bag clenched in his hand. It contained 2.88 grams of cocaine. The police also found ten glassine bags, bundled together, containing .21 gram of heroin and a small quantity of marijuana in his pockets. Although the defendant argued there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he intended to distribute the heroin, the court held the evidence that at the time he possessed the heroin he was engaged in the sale of another drug, along with the packaging of the heroin and the fact he possessed three drugs, was sufficient to warrant a rational fact finder in finding intent to distribute the heroin beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. at 79-80.', ""In the present case, by contrast, there is no evidence of the defendant's conduct, either before or after his arrest, that suggests his possession was with the intent to distribute as opposed to personal use. See Commonwealth v. Keefner,"", ', 517-518 (2012) (no probable cause to search where police', 'Page 782', 'did not observe any illegal or suspicious behavior of defendant indicating intent to distribute marijuana).', ""d. Implements associated with distribution. In some cases, the defendant's possession of small quantities of drugs is determined to be more indicative of an intent to distribute than of mere possession because the defendant is found with or in the vicinity of paraphernalia associated with the distribution of drugs."", 'In the present case, there is no evidence connecting the defendant to any of the items often used by drug dealers to facilitate the packaging and distribution of drugs. Further, in view of the fact that the defendant possessed only three rocks of crack cocaine, weighing a total of approximately .4 grams, the mere fact that the drugs were packaged for street level sale is not probative on the ""dealer versus user"" question.', '', 'Page 783', 'e. Possession of currency. The fact that a person found in possession of drugs also has on his person or under his control a ""a large amount of cash,"" Pena v. Commonwealth,', ', 1018 (1998), may suggest his direct involvement in drug distribution.', 'In the present case, the defendant had $312 in cash on his person. Officer Wadlegger did not offer an opinion that the possession of this cash was a factor that suggested the defendant\'s possession of the drugs was with the intent to distribute. See Jowers v. State, 593 So.2d 46, 47 (Miss. 1992) (""[N]ot everyone who has $356.00 in cash is a drug dealer . . .""). The cash was not marked as an exhibit. There is no evidence that the cash consisted of denominations of bills corresponding to the proceeds of street level sales. Further, there is no evidence that the defendant was unemployed or had no known source of income. In these circumstances, the cash found on the defendant\'s person has little, if any, evidentiary value.', '', 'f. The Gonzales case. The principal case on which the majority relies is Commonwealth v. Gonzales,', ', 731 (1992), in which we held that, although the question as to sufficiency of the evidence was ""a close one,"" an inference of', 'Page 784', 'possession with the intent to distribute was possible, with the aid of expert witness testimony, even though the amount of the drugs was small (.32 grams). The differences between the present case and Gonzales are significant. There, although the amount of the drugs was small, an expert witness testified that the possession of a ""bundle"" of ten individually wrapped and distinctively stamped packets of heroin, tied together by an elastic, was consistent with possession with intent to distribute rather than personal use, and the defendant had $167 in ""loose currency"" despite being unemployed.', 'Here, by contrast, there were only three packets of cocaine. There was also no evidence the defendant was unemployed and thus unlikely to have this amount of cash in his pocket. In sum, there was less evidence in this case than in Gonzales, which the court considered to be a ""close"" case. Ibid. There is no appellate authority in this Commonwealth for the view that the possession of a small quantity of drugs and an amount of cash as in this case ($312) without more permits a reasonable inference that the drugs were possessed with the intent to distribute. Contrast Commonwealth v. Rivera,', ', 647-649 (1997) (although defendant had only two bags of cocaine weighing respectively .18 and .23 grams and $20, his conviction of possession with the intent to distribute was warranted by evidence that police observed him engage in hand-to-hand sales of drugs from the apartment).', ""4. Opinion testimony by Officer Wadlegger. a. Lack of adequate foundation. The opinion testimony of an experienced narcotics investigator may supply additional evidence necessary to enable a fact finder to determine that a defendant's possession of drugs was with the intent to distribute. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gollman,"", ', 115-117 (2002); Commonwealth v. Evans,', ', 371-372, 376-377 (2002); Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 265 n.9 (2010).', 'Officer Wadlegger contributed two opinions in his capacity as an expert witness in this case. First, he opined that the size and packaging of the drugs was ""consistent with street level sale."" ""This much-used word has certain chameleon-like qualities. Many activities may be \'consistent\' with a certain state of affairs,', 'Page 785', 'but equally, if not more, consistent with completely different ones. The probative effect of \'consistent\' evidence depends upon the extent to which the consistency is exclusive of other explanations, and elicited testimony using the word should make this clear."" Parker v. United States, 601 A.2d 45, 52 n.23 (D.C. 1991).', 'The present case illustrates the weakness of relying predominantly on expert witness opinion that certain facts are ""consistent with"" intent to distribute, because, here, without added information that the defendant was actually loitering in a high crime area and doing something in some way associated with the sale of drugs, the inference that the defendant was a seller as opposed to a recent buyer -- that is, that any ""street level sale"" was by the defendant rather than to the defendant -- is a matter of speculation. See Commonwealth v. Murphy,', ', 18-19 (1993).', ""Officer Wadlegger's second opinion was that the defendant was more likely a seller rather than a user because he did not have a pipe in his possession. While this adds something to the equation, see Commonwealth v. Wilson,"", ', 401-402 (2004); Commonwealth v. Little,', ', 770, 792 (2009), to infer intent to distribute on the basis of this opinion, even in combination with the first opinion, would also be based on speculation given the absence of other indicia of an intent to distribute', ""and the fact that Officer Wadlegger conceded that he had arrested and charged other persons with mere possession of crack cocaine even though they were not in possession of implements for smoking the cocaine, that other common items such as soda cans can be used to smoke crack cocaine, and that crack cocaine can be mixed with marijuana and smoked in the form of a cigarette. See Sevigny's Case,"", ', 751 (1958) (""an opinion given by an expert will be disregarded where it amounts to no more than mere speculation or a guess from subordinate facts that do not give adequate support to the conclusion reached""). In sum, even though this opinion provides evidence that, when stopped, users of cocaine ""usually have', 'Page 786', 'something on their person . . . to ingest [the] drug,"" it also states that that is not always the case; thus, it is not sufficient to provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the element of intent to distribute.', ""b. Inadmissible hearsay basis for expert opinion. The trial judge sustained seven hearsay-based objections by defense counsel over the course of Officer Wadlegger's brief testimony. On cross-examination, this telling exchange occurred:"", 'Q.: ""And there is nothing about the fact that it\'s three rocks that suggests to you that he\'s a dealer?""', 'A.: ""The manner in which it was packaged, our information about [the defendant], the area, the observations beforehand, and the way it\'s packaged, and the amount.""', 'Q.: ""Let me ask you this: Did you personally see [the defendant] engage in narcotics transactions on September 30, 2009?""', 'A.: ""I did not, no.""', 'Q.: ""And so you\'re relying predominantly on information that was provided by outside sources?""', 'A.: ""Yes. From a reliable informant, correct.""', 'Q.: ""And the informant\'s name?""', 'A.: ""I don\'t have that. It wasn\'t my informant.""', 'Although defense counsel did not move to strike the remainder of Officer Wadlegger\'s opinion testimony, this testimony casts a pall over his other opinion testimony. This case falls into that narrow and exceptional class of cases in which the failure to object to evidence at trial must be noticed for the first time by an appellate court because the record on appeal demonstrates that the error was plain and trial counsel\'s failure to object created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 508 (2003) (""There may be instances, too, when obvious deficiencies in representation will be addressed by an appellate court sua sponte""); Commonwealth', 'Page 787', 'v.

Lester,', ', 63-66 (2007).', ""The principal problem with Officer Wadlegger's opinion testimony is that, as he testified on cross-examination, it was based predominantly on inadmissible hearsay, and it thus violated the defendant's right to confrontation insofar as it channeled information from an informant who was not a witness at trial or even identified, and whose reliability was unknown. See Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 2713, 2716 (2011). See also Williams v. Illinois, 132 S.Ct. 2221 (2012) (plurality opinion). Without it, any inference that the defendant's possession of the drugs was with the intent to distribute would be based only on speculation. See Commonwealth v.

Application of the Jackson-Latimore standard. a. Deference to rational fact finder. In Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. at 374, citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 318-319, the Supreme Judicial Court adopted the governing Federal due process standard for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case. This test has multiple parts. Sufficiency of the evidence challenges in most cases are resolved on the basis of the first part of the Jackson-Latimore standard, which is relied upon by the majority. We defer to the jury or judicial fact finder\'s judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence when, ""after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,', 'rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt"" (emphasis original). Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319. This case, however,', 'Page 788', 'is not one in which the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to infer an intent to distribute beyond a reasonable doubt.', '', 'b. Conclusions based on conjecture insufficient to support conviction. The second part of the Jackson-Latimore standard is reserved for cases such as this where proof of an essential element such as intent has been deemed sufficient by the fact finder on the basis of a conjecture, as opposed to a reasonable inference, from the evidence. ""[I]t is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; it must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt."" Latimore, 378 Mass. at 677-678.', 'It is possible that the defendant in this case had possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it. One could speculate that the defendant had sold ten to fifteen twists of crack cocaine for $20 apiece before the police arrived and arrested him, which might account for much of the cash in his pocket. One could speculate that the absence of a pipe with which to smoke crack cocaine means that the three twists of crack cocaine in the defendant\'s possession were being held with the intent to distribute. One could speculate that the defendant was standing in an area known for drug sales with a group of individuals, one of whom was a drug dealer, before they entered the Daily Mart store because he too was a drug dealer. However, our duty as an appellate court requires us ""to take a hard look at the record and to reject those evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative. . . . This function is especially important in criminal cases, given the prosecution\'s obligation to prove every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt."" United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995). Accord Commonwealth v. Montalvo,', ', 329-330 (2010).

Rodriguez,', ', 582 (2010).', 'c. The evidence of intent to distribute is insufficient to satisfy the Jackson-Latimore standard because it tends equally to sustain two inconsistent propositions. The principle that in certain situations the fact finder can permissibly draw either of two conflicting, but nonetheless reasonable and possible, inferences, is illustrated by the facts in Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 260-261, 264-266 (2010). There, the police observed a van parked with its engine running and lights on. The passenger side door was open and a man was observed bending over behind a dumpster. The man then entered the van, and it drove away. The police followed the van and pulled it over after a traffic violation. Id. at 260-261. The experienced narcotics officers suspected that drugs had been either dropped off or picked up. Ibid. The defendant was pat frisked. The police found a cellular telephone in his right pants pocket and, in the pocket of a pair of athletic style shorts underneath his pants, a clear plastic bag filled with 13.98 grams of powder cocaine. Id. at 261, 262. During booking, the detectives also removed $56 in cash. Id. at 261. A police witness acknowledged that the defendant\'s activity at the dumpster, combined with the discovery of cocaine in his inner pocket, ""would suggest that the defendant was a buyer, but he further opined, without objection, that the quantity of cocaine in the defendant\'s pocket, the cellular telephone, and the fifty-six dollars found during the patfrisk were consistent with possession with intent to distribute."" Id. at 262. According to the police officer\'s testimony, ""street sales typically involve amounts of cocaine up to one gram; the defendant had 13.98 grams, almost one half ounce of cocaine."" Ibid. Despite the absence of paraphernalia indicative of drug dealing or items indicative of personal consumption, the critical additional evidence was supplied by another police witness.', '""Testifying as an expert, he identified the North Common Street area where the defendant was first seen behind the dumpster as a high drug crime area. He described typical street level cocaine transactions in Lynn as involving one gram, one-half gram, or one-quarter gram bags, called', 'Page 790', '\' twists,\' being sold for twenty to forty dollars. He also testified that larger quantities of cocaine, such as five to six grams, are amounts more typical of purchases by a \'mid level dealer,\' and can be broken down into smaller twists for sale to individual users. He expressed the opinion that a one-half ounce of cocaine is \'not usually for personal use\' because \'[i]t\'s a lot of cocaine to have on hand\' for one user, saying that the common practice of street-level users is to buy one or two small twists at a time because they do not have the money to buy larger quantities. He conceded that some people do acquire larger amounts for personal use, but in his experience on the streets of Lynn, one-half ounce of cocaine is \'an awful lot of cocaine\' for that purpose. He estimated that the amount of cocaine found on the defendant would sell for about $600 as a single package, but could be divided into fifty-six separate one-quarter gram twists, sold on the street at twenty dollars each.""', 'Id. at 262.', '', 'In Hernandez, supra at 264-265, we explained that the familiar and often cited axiom from Commonwealth v. Croft,', "", 145, (1962), quoting from Commonwealth v. O'Brien,"", ', 400 (1940) (""When the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof""), was not applicable: ""This case does not involve such a small amount of drugs; the drug expert opined that a typical package sold on the street is one-quarter of one gram. Here, the defendant was in possession of a bag containing 13.98 grams, which, as the expert permissibly stated, can be broken down into fifty-six one-quarter gram street bags."" Id. at 265. In other words, in Hernandez, based on the quantity of the cocaine and the police officer\'s expert testimony concerning typical street level transactions and the significance of this amount, the inference from the', 'Page 791', 'evidence that the defendant possessed the cocaine for personal use was not as likely as the inference that he possessed it with the intent to distribute it, and therefore the fact finder had a rational basis for choosing to draw the latter inference instead of the former inference.

Wilborne,', ', 245 (1981) (""To the extent that conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, \'it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies\' ""); Commonwealth v.

Here, on the other hand, considering the totality of the evidence, even if the two opinions contributed by Officer Wadlegger (the significance of the size and packaging of the three rocks of crack cocaine and the absence of a pipe) are given evidentiary weight, the inference of possession with intent to distribute and the inference of possession for personal use are inconsistent and equally plausible.', 'See Commonwealth v.

And, without Officer Wadlegger\'s opinions, the speculative leap required to reach the conclusion that the defendant\'s possession was with the intent to distribute would be even greater.', 'The question in this case is not the plausibility or implausibility of any hypothetical theory of innocence, but simply whether the evidence the Commonwealth presented was constitutionally sufficient to permit a rational finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the three rocks of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute.

As they drove, they passed Edgemere Street, where they noticed two men walking.

As the officers passed them, the men, unsurprisingly given the poor weather, had their ""hoodies"" pulled over their faces and their hands inside their pockets.

Seconds after passing the men, the officers heard a radio call stating that a person had been shot at 41 Clarendon Avenue, which was no more than 100 yards from their current location.', 'Both officers testified that they were familiar with 41 Clarendon Avenue because the police were frequently called to that address due to prostitution and gang activity.

Both men still had their hands inside their pockets, holding them up against their waists. Because of the nature of the call, the fact that somebody had just been shot, and the probability that a firearm was somewhere close by, Officer Spillane drew his weapon and pointed at the subjects as he got out of the cruiser. Officer Lonergan also exited the vehicle and asked the men to take their hands out of their pockets. As the defendant moved his hand, ""a large item"" fell to the darkened ground. The other man, Antoine McKoy, the defendant\'s brother as it turned out, began to backpedal and only removed one hand, keeping the other in his pocket.

Within a few seconds of passing the defendant, the police officers received a radio message stating that someone had been shot at 41 Clarendon Avenue. By the time the police officers turned around and confronted the defendant, he was no more than fifty yards from where they had just seen him. Because of the nature of the crime, the time of day, the weather conditions, and the proximity to the crime scene, the police officers had reasonable suspicion to question the defendant and his brother. When asked to take their hands out of their pockets, the defendant dropped a large item to the ground, while his brother kept his hand in his pocket prior to fleeing. Taken together, these actions justified the stop. See Commonwealth v. Thibeau,', ', 764 (1981).', 'Disproportionate force.

Williams,', ', 117-119 (1996), is illustrative. There, police officers were on patrol when they observed the defendant running down the street. The defendant was sweating, had a strained expression on his face, and discarded his shirt without breaking pace. The officers proceeded to follow the defendant who, upon closer observation, was covered with blood. The officers ordered the defendant to stop. The defendant then took evasive action by running through back yards and scaling chain link fences. At that point, one of the officers drew his service revolver, followed the defendant, and ordered him to stop and get on the ground. While handcuffing the defendant, the officers received a radio broadcast confirming a shooting, approximately 200 to 400 yards from where they had stopped the defendant.', 'The court held that not only drawing a gun, but handcuffing the individual, was reasonable to ensure the officer\'s safety. The court reasoned that the length of the encounter, the nature of the inquiry, the possibility of flight, and the danger to the officers\' safety justified the action taken. Id. at 119.

It is indisputable that, at the point when the two police officers exited the cruiser, and one officer pointed a service revolver at the two men walking, there was a seizure.', 'See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bottari,', "", 780, 782 (1985) (seizure at the point when the police went to the defendant's car with their guns drawn); Commonwealth v. Willis,"", ', 820 (1993) (seizure as officers approached a defendant with guns drawn); Commonwealth v. Lopes,', ', 155 (2009) (seizure occurred when the police officer drew his weapon and pointed it toward the suspect).', 'So, under defined constitutional standards, this court in appellate review is to consider what ""specific and articulable facts"" existed in this case at the time of the stop and seizure of the two men walking. The majority writes much about what happened after the time of the stop and seizure -- i.e., that one man fled when confronted by the police, that the defendant had ammunition, and that a gun was found on the ground near him. But the events and firearm discovery the majority cites happened after the seizure. Such postseizure events are not, and cannot be, a retroactive constitutional justification. See note 6, infra.

The facts are taken from the uncontroverted testimony of the police officers at the suppression hearing. The suppression testimony is cited because the judge made no findings of fact.', '', 'The summary sets forth what the suppression record affirmatively shows as the facts existing at the time of this seizure. The summary also negatively shows what specific and articulable facts, inferences, and information were missing at the time of the seizure.', 'I. The Initial Police Sighting of the Two Men Walking.', '1. At approximately 9:30 P.M. on January 18, 2011, two police officers were driving a cruiser away from Lorraine Avenue in Brockton, having obtained a stolen car report in an unrelated matter; the cruiser proceeded to Edgemere Street.', '2. It was snowing, and the officers did not see any people walking about on this stormy night.', 'Page 318', '3. As the cruiser turned onto Edgemere Street, the officers saw two men (one of whom was the defendant) walking down that street; the two men had their hands in their pockets and ""hoodies"" up covering their heads, which were turned ""a little bit maybe so you couldn\'t see their faces or away from the wind or something."" But the officers did not see anything unusual in the way the men were walking.', 'Further, neither officer recognized or knew of the two men. Accordingly, the officers drove the cruiser by the two men, and the police initiated no interaction with the two walking men.', 'II. The Limited Police Radio Bulletin of a Shooting Nearby.', '1. As the cruiser moved further down Edgemere Street and turned onto Belmont Street, the officers heard a radio bulletin that there had been a shooting at 41 Clarendon Avenue, another nearby street. The only information in the bulletin was that a person had been shot at 41 Clarendon Avenue; no other details were within the bulletin. See number 4 below.', '2. One of the officers knew that 41 Clarendon Avenue was ""a trouble spot,"" with a history of prostitution and of being a gang hangout; however, neither officer had any information connecting the two walking men to that house.', ""3. Having heard the bulletin, the officers activated the cruiser's blue lights"", 'and circled back to Edgemere Street.', 'Page 319', '4. Given that it clearly was the radio bulletin which prompted the cruiser to return to Edgemere Street, where the two men were walking, it is of import to the constitutional analysis on reasonable suspicion to focus on what this intervening radio bulletin did, and did not, convey.', '(i) As noted, the radio bulletin reported that someone had been shot at 41 Clarendon Avenue.', '(ii) The bulletin provided no information about the shooting incident, and no detail concerning potential suspects.', '(iii) The bulletin provided no description of what any suspect involved in the shooting was wearing.', '', '(iv) The bulletin provided no information concerning the reliability of the source of the radio bulletin of a shooting -- nothing about a 911 caller, or a reliable', 'Page 320', 'tipster, or a police dispatch, or police investigation of the 41 Clarendon Avenue shooting site.', 'III. Gun-Drawn Seizure of the Two Men.\n\n  1. The cruiser, with lights now activated, returned to Edgemere Street. The two men were still walking approximately fifty yards from when the officers had first seen them, and approximately 100 yards from 41 Clarendon Avenue. Nothing had changed vis-à-vis the scene of the two men; both continued to walk with their hands in their pockets and hoodies up, just like when the police cruiser had passed by earlier. In all perspectives, the visual scene was precisely the same as when the officers drove the cruiser by the first time. The only addition to the visual scene was the audio of the intervening radio bulletin, described in number 4 (i)-(iv) above.', '2. On this return to Edgemere Street, the officers stopped the cruiser close to the two men.', '3. Officer Spillane quickly exited the cruiser and immediately drew his gun, pointed it at the two men, and ordered the men to show their hands.', '(This marks the moment of seizure, see note 2, supra, and accompanying text about the pointed gun as the seizure).', '4. At the suppression hearing, Officer Spillane explained his actions as follows:', 'PROSECUTOR: ""Now, when you first saw them and you exited your cruiser, did you draw your weapon or . . . ?""', 'SPILLANE: ""Yes. Yes, I drew my weapon.""', 'PROSECUTOR: ""And why did you do that? What were your concerns at that point?""', 'Page 321', 'SPILLANE: ""Well, because of the -- you know,', '"" (emphasis added).', 'One cannot read this testimony by the officer, except as being based on ""', '"" (emphasis added). Commonwealth v. Silva,', ', 406 (1974). A report of a shooting, without more information, and without any connective link to two men walking on a street, even on a stormy night, is not enough. That the ""odds were that there\'s a firearm close by"" is not enough.', 'Central to the analysis of the stop and seizure in this case is that there was no demonstrated reliability in the information conveyed in the radio bulletin. The content of the radio broadcast had no reference to origin source, no predicate of reliability, and no independent corroboration of the information therein. Thus, it was, in legal effect, a broadcast of anonymous information. As the United States Supreme Court held in Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), such anonymous information -- which remains anonymous even if embedded in a police radio bulletin -- is not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion.', '""The anonymous call concerning J.L. provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant\'s knowledge or credibility. That the allegation about the gun turned out to be correct does not suggest that the officers, prior to the frisks, had a reasonable basis for suspecting J.L. of engaging in unlawful conduct: The reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search. All the police had to go on in this case was the bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about J.L.""', 'Id. at 271.\n\n        The majority relies on the geographic closeness of the two walking men to a house which one of the officers, from past', 'Page 322', 'experience, recognized as a trouble spot. But that geographic closeness to a house with a past history does not fill the void in reasonable suspicion as to individuals walking on a nearby street. Again, as the United States Supreme Court held in the J.L. case,', '""[a]n accurate description of a subject\'s readily observable location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited sense: It will help the police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity. The reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person. Cf. 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 9.4(h), p. 213 (3d ed. 1996) (distinguishing reliability as to identification, which is often important in other criminal law contexts, from reliability as to the likelihood of criminal activity, which is central in anonymous-tip cases).""', 'Id. at 272.', 'Notwithstanding the actual suppression record background, as summarized in parts I, II, and III, supra, the majority draws a different picture concerning the stop and seizure and the police drawing of a gun and pointing it at the two men. The majority writes as follows.', '""Because of the nature of the crime, the time of day, the weather conditions, and the proximity to the crime scene, the police officers had reasonable suspicion to question the defendant and his brother.', '"". . .', '""Here, it was reasonable for Officer Spillane to take out and point his weapon at the outset of the encounter.

The drawing of a gun pointed at a suspect, as a patfrisk, requires that the police officer ""reasonably fear [] for his own safety or the safety of the public, . . . or [that] the police officer reasonably believe[] that the individual is armed and dangerous."" Commonwealth v. Isaiah I.,', ', 824 (2008). (Citations omitted.) The fear or belief that an individual is armed and dangerous must be ""based on specific and articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom, in light of the officer\'s experience."" Commonwealth v. Wilson,', ', 394 (2004).', 'Contrary to what the majority writes, Officer Spillane did not', 'Page 324', 'say that he drew his service revolver because specific, objective facts unfolding before him gave rise to the need for ""reasonable precaution for his own safety."" Rather, as noted, the officer only testified that he drew his revolver because of the ""odds"" (which is a hunch) associated with the radio bulletin of a shooting nearby so that he thought the ""odds"" were (the hunch was) that the two men might have a gun. But, at this point, based on the actual facts present, and for the legal reasons discussed in this dissent, the suppression record did not present specific and articulable facts that the two men walking were armed and dangerous.', 'That firearms are a real and present threat to police officers on patrol is a given to me, and that police officers may, and must, take steps to lessen danger is also a given. However, in this case, the initial police action of a gun-drawn seizure -- without sufficient reasonable suspicion, and without the police undertaking other, more proportionate cautionary and protective threshold investigative steps -- is constitutionally infirm. I turn again to what is constitutional law under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.', '""Firearms are dangerous, and extraordinary dangers sometimes justify unusual precautions. Our decisions recognize the serious threat that armed criminals pose to public safety; Terry\'s rule, which permits protective police searches on the basis of reasonable suspicion rather than demanding that officers meet the higher standard of probable cause, responds to this very concern. See 392 U.S., at 30. But an automatic firearm exception to our established reliability analysis would rove too far.""', ""J.L., 529 U.S. at 272.\n\n        Conclusion. Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the limited factual tableau -- and the limited radio bulletin -- did not yield reasonable suspicion to justify this seizure at the time it was made. Instead, at the time the seizure occurred, the marginal record facts were far below specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer's experience. (See cases collected in note 1 and accompanying text). For these reasons, I believe the motion to suppress should have been granted, and I dissent.""]"

On December 11, 2007, at approximately 10:00 P.M., officers from the Brockton police department and the State police executed a search warrant for an apartment on the third floor of 109 Green Street in Brockton. The officers knocked and announced themselves, and after five or ten seconds State Trooper Erik Telford forced the door open with a battering ram. Inside, the officers found the defendant on the living room couch and her codefendant, David Nelson,', 'also near the couch. The defendant was wearing only a T-shirt and underwear at the time; Nelson did not have a shirt on. The defendant requested clothing, and an officer brought her clothing from the bedroom. Both defendants were secured outside the apartment during the search.', 'The apartment was very small, consisting of a living room with a closet and kitchenette, a small hallway, one small bedroom, and a bathroom. The living room were approximately eight feet by twelve feet. In the living room were a couch, a coffee table about three feet long, a chair, an end table, and a television. The bedroom was smaller than the living room and contained a bed, a dresser, and plastic shelving. The apartment was cluttered, with trash and clothing, and in disarray.', 'Brockton police Detective Robert Diliddo found and seized two cellular telephones (phones) and a digital scale on the coffee table.', ""The scale is small and resembles a compact disk (CD) when closed, as it was when Diliddo found it.

See Brown, 34 Mass. App. Ct. at 225, 227 (""there was obviously sufficient evidence"" to convict codefendant Howard of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute because ""[t]he apartment was Howard\'s place; it was full of his personal papers,"" and he was ""the person who controlled the apartment""). Cf. Commonwealth v. Charlton, supra at 303. The defendant here gave the apartment as her address at booking. See id. at 302-303. She was there at a late hour of the night in a state of undress. See Commonwealth v. Rodriquez,', ', 945-946 (1983). Cf. Commonwealth v. Arias,', ', 615, 619 (1990), S.C.,', ""(1991). The sole bedroom contained only women's items, and the police retrieved clothing for her from it, giving rise to a reasonable inference that it was hers. See Commonwealth v. Rarick, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913; Commonwealth v. Clarke, 44 Mass. App. Ct. at 505-506."", 'Finally, there was no evidence establishing that another person in the apartment, rather than the defendant, was the person', 'Page 413', 'controlling the apartment or the contraband and its proceeds.', 'In contrast, in Boria and especially in Brown, the evidence strongly pointed to other codefendants as responsible for the drugs.', 'In Brown, one codefendant (Howard) was the primary occupant and another (Mikell) was found with cash and cocaine on her person, apparently attempting to dispose of other drugs. Brown, 34 Mass. App. Ct. at 225. In Boria, one of the codefendants had over $1,200 in cash on him. Boria, 440 Mass. at 417 n.3.', 'The only cash found here was the $110 located in the bedroom belonging to the defendant. See Commonwealth v. Rarick, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913. Although this is not an unusually large amount of cash, the jury could have inferred that it constituted the proceeds of drug sales, in light of the expert testimony as well as other evidence concerning the value of the seized drugs. See Commonwealth v. Arias, 29 Mass. App. Ct. at 619 n.10. In sum, the evidence here sufficed to establish knowledge as well as ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine. See Commonwealth v. Alcantara,', ', 596-597 (2002).', 'As for intent to distribute, there was sufficient evidence based on the quantity of the cocaine; the expert testimony regarding the differences between distributors and users of cocaine; and the presence of plastic bags, a cellular phone, a BB gun, and', 'Page 414', 'most particularly, a digital scale. We therefore reverse the order entering findings of not guilty.', ""3. Defendant's cross appeal. The defendant raises several issues that she urges are grounds to reverse her convictions if the evidence was sufficient to sustain them. We take them in turn."", ""a. Motion to dismiss. The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that improper evidence was presented to the grand jury. See generally Commonwealth v. O'Dell,"", '(1984). Specifically, Diliddo testified at the grand jury that the police were investigating drug sales at 109 Green Street, apartment 3, and that Telford had a confidential informant who knew that the defendant and Nelson were selling drugs at that apartment. The defendant contends that this information constituted prior bad acts and that it was irrelevant because she was not charged with distribution of drugs, only possession with intent to distribute. See Commonwealth v. Vinnie,', "", 174-175, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998). However, this limited testimony was probative of the defendant's intent to distribute, and the defendant has not shown that it was either false or misleading. See Commonwealth v. Brien,"", ', 914 (1984); Commonwealth v. Sullivan, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 293 , 299 (2012). Cf. Commonwealth v. Helfant,', ', 224-225 (1986). Seeking an indictment for possession with intent to distribute rather than distribution was within ""the discretion of the prosecuting authority to decide what charge the government will bring."" Commonwealth v. Rose,', ', 919 (2002). Cf. Commonwealth v. Gordon,', ', 500-501 (1991). The motion to dismiss was properly denied.', 'b. Motion to suppress. The defendant argues that her motion to suppress based on the warrant particularity requirement should have been allowed. See generally Commonwealth v. Balicki,', ', 7-8 (2002); G. L. c. 276, § 2. When he applied for the search warrant, Diliddo believed that there were three apartments at 109 Green Street, and therefore sought and secured a warrant for ""109 Green St, Brockton Ma, third floor apartment."" In fact, there were nine apartments in that building, three on each floor. The warrant could therefore have been read as permitting a search of any of three apartments.', 'Page 415', 'However, Diliddo\'s affidavit supporting the warrant included information by an informant that the third-floor apartment was accessed via the side door adjacent to the fire escape, and was at the top of the stairs, ""right in front of you with a yellow sign on the front door that reads something to the effect of \'Private/Keep Out.\' "" The officers executing the warrant found the defendant\'s apartment as described, and entered and searched the correct apartment. The case is analogous to Commonwealth v. Todisco,', ""(1973), where a warrant could have referred to any of three apartments in a building, but the affidavit sufficiently identified the apartment to be searched. Id. at 448-450. There, as here, the affiant was involved in the execution of the warrant and located the defendant's apartment and no other. See id. at 449. Under the circumstances, we discern no error in the denial of the motion to suppress. See Commonwealth v. Toledo,"", ', 696- 697 (2006).', '', 'c. ""Knock and announce"" rule. After Telford testified at trial that he had waited five or ten seconds between announcing his presence and forcing the door open, the defendant made an objection based on the ""knock and announce"" rule, and now argues that suppression of the fruits of the search was warranted on this basis. See generally Commonwealth v. Santiago,', ', 574-575 (2008). The defendant did not file a timely motion to suppress, and indeed never filed a motion to suppress on this basis. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a), (d), as appearing in  442 Mass. 1517  (2004). She requested no specific relief from the trial judge.', ""Even treating the objection as a motion to suppress, it was within the judge's discretion to decline to entertain it in the middle of trial. See Commonwealth v. Pope,"", ', 507 (1983). See also Smith, Criminal Practice & Procedure § 24.23, at 359. Moreover, we have upheld a', 'Page 416', 'five-second delay for a narcotics search warrant where the police have information that occupants may have guns. See Commonwealth v. Bush,', ', 132-135 & n.8 (2008). Here, an informant had told Telford that, within a day prior to the search, Nelson had loaded a firearm and threatened to make someone ""disappear,"" and probation records indicated that Nelson had been convicted of two prior weapons offenses.', 'In light of this information and prior controlled purchases indicating drug distribution, ""it was reasonable for the police to fear a threat to their safety within five seconds."" Id. at 135.', 'd. Expert testimony. Finally, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in permitting Keating to testify beyond his expertise and vouch for his own credibility. The defendant filed a motion in limine to prevent Keating from testifying ""that a theoretical drug \'buyer\' would not purchase multiple bags of cocaine and instead purchase said substances in bulk,"" relying on Commonwealth v. Little,', '(2009), which criticized an ""imprecise economic argument"" made by Keating as ""likely beyond his expertise as a narcotics investigator."" Id. at 771. The trial judge allowed the motion to the extent that Keating\'s testimony related to the behavior of hypothetical buyers rather than his own experiences and observations, but indicated she could not completely address the issue in the abstract. However, although the defendant objected to Keating\'s qualification as an expert (which she does not contest on appeal), she did not object to any of the specific statements that she now challenges, and so we review Keating\'s testimony for error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See id. at 770.', 'Keating testified that crack addicts usually do not keep money on their persons because they would spend it on more cocaine, and so the recovery of money suggests that it could be the proceeds from drug sales. He also testified that addicts would likely have drug paraphernalia around because they would consume the cocaine as soon as they got it, and he had never seen an addict weigh crack cocaine unless they were going to sell part of it. These statements were not objected to, and are', 'Page 417', ""not obviously beyond Keating's experience and expertise."", 'See id. at 770-771. To the extent Keating made ""economic"" arguments of the type at issue in Little, they were largely elicited in response to defense counsel\'s questions about the behavior of a hypothetical crack addict and were not objected to.', 'See Commonwealth v. DeCastro,', "", 938 (1987). This evidence was also primarily relevant to the question of intent to distribute, whereas the defendant's defense was lack of possession. Cf. Commonwealth v. Springer,"", ', 480 (2000). There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice from this testimony.', ""Finally, the defendant calls attention to a portion of Keating's testimony where he described how prosecutors seek his opinion whether he would be prepared to take the stand to testify whether the drugs were for distribution or personal use, and that he would give them his opinion. Keating stated that if he opines that personal use is more likely, the prosecutor typically does not proceed with charges based on intent to distribute. He further indicated that he has only testified that a situation is not indicative of distribution five to ten times out of hundreds of times testifying as an expert in court. The defendant asserts that by this testimony, Keating was improperly vouching for his own credibility. Cf. Commonwealth v. Burgess,"", ', 436 (2008), quoting from Simon v. Solomon,', ', 105 (1982). Although generally not an appropriate line of inquiry, in this instant case it was a fair response to Nelson\'s pointed attack on Keating\'s credibility as ""the ultimate hired gun"" trying to help out his colleagues, which Nelson\'s counsel made during', 'Page 418', 'his opening and reinforced during his cross-examination. Cf. Commonwealth v. Ortega,', ', 180 n.17 (2004); Commonwealth v. Saunders,', ', 509 (2009). In his opening, for example, defense counsel for Nelson stated that Keating has a ""percentage . . . that . . . [Dustin] Pedroia and the Red Sox would die for. Almost a thousand percent saying things are consistent with distribution."" The defendant did not object to Nelson\'s cross-examination, which elicited the same information. We discern no abuse of discretion under these circumstances in admitting this testimony.', ""4. Conclusion. There was sufficient evidence to support the defendant's convictions, and no error requiring reversal of the judgments. The order allowing the defendant's motion to set aside the verdicts and finding is reversed. The jury verdicts, the judge's subsequent offender finding, and the judgments shall be reinstated."", 'So ordered.']"

Specifically, we address three points involving the denial of the defendant's motion to suppress recorded oral communications between a confidential informant (CI), the defendant, and a codefendant, Victor Alvarado. First, the defendant argues that the averments in State Trooper Steven M. Racki's affidavit in support of a warrant for the one-party consensual recording of conversations under Commonwealth v. Blood,"", '(1987) (Blood warrant), failed to demonstrate the required nexus with organized crime. Second, the defendant contends that the Blood warrant was overbroad in scope. Third, the defendant argues that because the affidavit in support of the Blood warrant contained certain factual discrepancies (principally relating to telephone record information), the motion judge improperly declined to hold a', 'Page 486', ""hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) (Franks hearing), to test the veracity of statements in the trooper's affidavit. We affirm the denial of the motion to suppress and the denial of the motion for a Franks hearing."", ""In addition, we address the defendant's contention that double jeopardy barred the trial below and, hence, the convictions from which he now appeals. For reasons that follow, we conclude that there is no such double jeopardy obstacle."", '1. Background. We briefly summarize the relevant background concerning the motion to suppress and shall supplement this background as needed in our analysis of particular issues. The defendant was arrested in connection with an undercover investigation by the State police in which cocaine was bought by the CI. After a series of sample controlled ""buys"" under police direction, Alvarado indicated to the CI that he could procure a kilogram of cocaine on short notice, and the CI advised Alvarado that he would be in touch about a purchase. Based on the large quantity of the planned purchase, Trooper Racki filed an affidavit in support of, and procured, a Blood warrant authorizing the tape recording of oral communications between the consulting CI and other persons -- including, but not limited to, Alvarado -- involved in the deal for the kilogram purchase.', '', 'On the day set for the controlled buy of the kilogram of cocaine, Trooper Racki, a surveillance team, and the CI arrived at the housing development where the transaction was to take place. The CI, under the Blood warrant, was equipped with a body wire to record his conversations. A car arrived at the site. The defendant was driving, and the two passengers were Alvarado and one Reggie Bragg.', 'The CI entered the car. The defendant and Alvarado produced the cocaine. The CI placed a small amount on his tongue to test the quality. The CI indicated to the individuals in the car that the cocaine was of acceptable quality.', 'Page 487', 'The body wire recorded the entire conversation that took place in the car among the CI, the defendant, Alvarado, and Bragg. The CI then exited the car under the guise of obtaining $24,000 in cash to pay for the cocaine. At that point, the CI met with Trooper Racki and confirmed to the trooper that the cocaine was in the car, commenting, ""That shit\'s good."" The body wire recorded this conversation between the CI and Trooper Racki.', ""Surveillance officers then converged upon the car and arrested the defendant, Alvarado, and Bragg. Seized from the car were two bricks of a white, powdery substance which laboratory analysis confirmed was cocaine. Each brick of cocaine was covered in cellophane and wrapped with duct tape and wax -- a manner of packaging that, Trooper Racki testified at trial, is characteristic of the bulk sale of cocaine at the kilogram level of weight. Also seized from the rear cargo area of the car was $29,000 in cash. Seized from the defendant's person was a ledger that contained names, notations, monetary figures, and references to cocaine in street vernacular."", '2. Harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt analysis. In determining whether the constitutional error in the admission of the drug certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard of review is whether, ""on the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the [jury] and did not contribute to the [jury\'s verdicts]."" Commonwealth v. Vasquez,', ', 360 (2010), quoting from Commonwealth v. Tyree,', ', 701 (2010). The Commonwealth must establish that other properly admitted evidence of guilt was so ""overwhelming"" as to ""nullify any effect"" that the improperly admitted drug certificates might have had on the jury. Commonwealth v. Vasquez, supra at 362, quoting from Commonwealth v. Tyree, supra at 704 n.44.', 'The Commonwealth cites several pieces of evidence which, it submits, rendered the admission of the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. These include: (1) that the CI, an experienced cocaine user, conducted a taste test of the cocaine and confirmed, ""That shit\'s good""; (2) Trooper Holland\'s testimony at trial that the substance seized had the appearance', 'Page 488', ""and texture of cocaine; (3) Trooper Racki's testimony that the substance -- formed as a brick and sheathed in cellophane, duct tape, and wax -- was packaged in a manner consistent with the distribution of individual kilograms of cocaine; (4) that the $29,000 in cash found in the car was suggestive of the proceeds from cocaine distribution; and (5) the defendant's ledger, which, according to the testimony of the Commonwealth's expert, Sergeant Feeney, resembled the type of record frequently used by dealers to keep track of transactions."", 'We conclude that these pieces of evidence, weighed either individually or in combination, were not so powerful as to ""nullify any effect"" of the admission of the drug certificates. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, supra at 362, quoting from Commonwealth v. Tyree, supra at 704 n.44.', ""Of the foregoing evidence, the Commonwealth relies most heavily on the CI's taste test, which identified the substance as high quality cocaine. However, this subjective taste test lacks any scientific reliability. Indeed, even a positive field test -- which, in contrast, has scientific underpinnings, and which may be conducted by a police officer experienced in drug investigations -- does not mean, per se, that the error in admitting a drug certificate is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Fernandez,"", ', 151 n.20 (2010) (""no appellate case from Massachusetts has accepted as reliable field test results, regardless of the purpose for which they are offered""); Commonwealth v. King,', "", 358- 359 (2012) (police field test not dispositive in absence of testimony on officer's expertise and type of field test kit used); Commonwealth v. Billings,"", "", 364-365 (2012) (police field test not sufficient without testimony on officer's expertise and testimony on actual test results). Compare Commonwealth v. Connolly,"", ', 831 (2009) (field tests one factor in nullifying effect of drug certificates in circumstances where testing officers had seventeen and thirteen years, respectively, of narcotics investigation experience and both were subject to cross-examination); Commonwealth v. Casali,', "", 147 (2011) (police field test rendered drug certificates harmless beyond reasonable doubt only in combination with defendant's own testimony that seized substances were heroin and marijuana,"", 'Page 489', ""defense counsel's concession on that point, and evidence that defendant was admitted to hospital for symptoms of heroin withdrawal one day after crime). Given that a field test may not meet the constitutional harmless error standard, a fortiori, a lay taste test -- even when conducted by an experienced cocaine user -- does not meet the grade of proof required to render the error in admitting the drug certificates harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."", ""The remaining pieces of evidence to which the Commonwealth cites, supra, fare no better in proving harmless error. Trooper Holland's trial testimony regarding the appearance of the substance, while relevant in light of his experience in the field, is not the type of potent evidence required to render constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Dawson,"", ', 467 (1987) (""it would be a rare case in which a witness\'s statement that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction""). See also Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 456 Mass. at 365 (""Mistaken identification of cocaine by trained and experienced law enforcement personnel is not unknown in the annals of our law""). Similarly, notwithstanding that Trooper Racki\'s testimony on the method of packaging may have provided a circumstantial link, ""[i]t is unlikely that the form of packaging is necessarily proof that a substance is a particular drug."" Commonwealth v. Perez,', ', 444 n.4 (2010). Finally, that a large amount of cash was found in the car, and that the defendant possessed a ledger, may be probative of drug sales, but does not prove chemical composition. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez, supra at 366-367 (scale, rubber bands, cash, sandwich bags, and ""walkie-talkie"" all relevant on issue of distribution but not on issue of chemical composition).', ""3. Motion to suppress recordings of conversations. As previously noted, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant's motion to suppress recordings of certain cellular telephone conversations between the CI and Alvarado, as well as the face-to-face conversations between the CI and the defendant that were recorded by the CI's body wire. We address these points of challenge."", 'a. The challenge to the organized crime predicate in the', 'Page 490', 'Blood warrant affidavit. General Laws c. 272, § 99, the so-called wiretap statute, sets forth a complex statutory framework governing the interception of communications by law enforcement officials and provides comprehensive procedures for judicial oversight and the procurement of warrants. See generally Commonwealth v. Vitello,', '(1975). Excepted from the full panoply of § 99 procedural requirements are communications recorded by law enforcement officers with the consent of one participating party while investigating designated offenses ""in connection with organized crime."" G. L. c. 272, § 99 B 4, 7.', 'See Commonwealth v. Thorpe,', ', 275-281 (1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982). See also Commonwealth v. Penta,', ', 550-553 (1996) (full § 99 warrant not required where one-party consent exception applies).', ""However, even if a full-scale interception warrant under G. L. c. 272, § 99, is not required, and even if the one-party consent exception applies, a warrant may still be required to comply with art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See Commonwealth v. Blood, 400 Mass. at 70-75. As noted, Trooper Racki submitted an affidavit in support of a Blood warrant to record one-party consensual conversations. The defendant contends that Trooper Racki's Blood warrant affidavit did not demonstrate a sufficient nexus to organized crime and, therefore, fell outside the one-party consent exception."", 'We conclude that the motion judge was correct in finding the requisite connection with organized crime. The judge aptly analogized this case to Commonwealth v. Zuluaga,', '(1997) (Zuluaga), in which this court addressed what constitutes a ""connection with organized crime"" for purposes of triggering the one-party consent exception. Id. at 633.', 'Page 491', 'Zuluaga similarly involved the street sale of a kilogram of cocaine, prior to which police had obtained a Blood warrant to record conversations between the informant-purchaser and the defendant-seller. Id. at 631. In the challenged affidavit in Zuluaga, the affiant State trooper stated, ""[I]t is my experience that persons involved in the distribution of kilogram and multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine necessarily conduct their activities in concert with others."" Id. at 634. This affirmation, the Zuluaga court reasoned, in the factual context of the case, was sufficient to demonstrate a connection to organized crime. See ibid. And so it is in this case, where the language in Trooper Racki\'s affidavit, as well as the underlying circumstances, were nearly identical to those in Zuluaga.', '', 'b. Scope of the Blood warrant. The defendant also contends that the Blood warrant lacked particularity because it was not limited to a specific range of dates and times. We disagree. The warrant, issued on December 8, 2005, clearly states: ""The authority granted by this order and warrant shall terminate fifteen (15) days after the issuance of said warrant."" Given that the date of issuance is printed conspicuously on the warrant, its time limitations are unambiguous and precise.', 'Further, the defendant contends that the warrant was overbroad because it permitted the recording of ""unknown co-conspirators."" This contention is likewise unavailing. At the outset of Trooper Racki\'s investigation, the parties to the cocaine distribution ring were still unascertained. Under those circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the warrant to permit the recording of unknown coconspirators. ""Common sense dictates that warrants for the', 'Page 492', 'seizure of oral communications not be limited in such a way as to preclude all flexibility and to endanger the safety of the informant or officer on whose body the transmitter is secreted."" Commonwealth v. Penta, 423 Mass. at 554.', ""4. Franks hearing. We are not persuaded by the defendant's assertions that the recordings were subject to suppression because he was improperly denied a Franks hearing. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). In seeking a Franks hearing, Alvarado (with whom the defendant joined) focused on inconsistencies between Trooper Racki's Blood warrant affidavit and certain telephone records, specifically with regard to the number and timing of telephone calls made between the CI and Alvarado."", 'There is a two-step process by which a defendant can challenge the veracity of statements in a search warrant affidavit. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. at 155-156; Commonwealth v. Amral,', ', 522-525 (1990). The first step involves the holding of a threshold Amral hearing, the purpose of which is to determine whether the defendant is constitutionally entitled to the second step, a Franks hearing. See Commonwealth v. Amral, supra at 522-523, 525. In this case, a second Superior Court judge afforded the defendant the benefit of an Amral hearing. However, based on the Amral hearing, the judge determined the defendant was not entitled to a Franks hearing because he did not establish the requisite ""substantial preliminary showing that the affiant [Trooper Racki] made a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth."" Commonwealth v. Douzanis,', ', 437 (1981).', 'In reaching this conclusion, the motion judge questioned Trooper Racki with regard to each potential discrepancy in the telephone records. Trooper Racki offered his explanations and reaffirmed that the affidavit was true to the best of his knowledge. The motion judge ultimately credited Trooper Racki\'s testimony and attributed the discrepancies to nonmaterial, bona fide mistakes. The motion judge further found that the contested misstatements were reconcilable with the telephone records and so concluded that ""there was nothing that I found that caused me any concern to cast a doubt as to the veracity of the representations made by the affiant."" In sum, we see no abuse of discretion', 'Page 493', ""in the motion judge's determination that the discrepancies did not rise to the level of requiring a Franks hearing."", ""5.

There are two fundamental flaws with respect to these contentions, and the defendant\'s challenge to Trial II. First, as to Trial II, which is the subject of this appeal, the defendant\'s brief has not cited even one piece of allegedly ""broader"" conspiracy evidence which may have been introduced in Trial I, and which was introduced again (and should have been excluded under the defendant\'s theory) in Trial II (without a joined conspiracy).', 'Second, even assuming that the improperly joined conspiracy and trafficking indictments in Trial I hypothetically led to ""broader"" evidence in Trial I (with the potential for spillover from the conspiracy to the substantive offenses), the defendant has suffered no resulting prejudice. Even if he had been convicted in Trial I, the defendant\'s remedy on appeal would have been a reversal of the Trial I convictions because of the improper joinder and a remand for retrial and further proceedings. In such further proceedings, the defendant could have been retried in one proceeding on both substantive offenses of trafficking and trafficking in a school zone.

However, this is not a correct time marking for banking vis-à-vis future criminal conduct. Rather, it is the date of the commission of the unrelated crime in the future that is the central entry on the time line, not the date of, or the effect of, the defendant's knowledge concerning the potential of a vacated sentence on an unrelated prior offense."", 'Just because the defendant did not know at the time of his future, unrelated criminal conduct in October, 2002, that his plea withdrawal motion would be allowed four years later in 2006, that does not give the defendant the benefit  of the time served on the prior, unrelated 1997 drug conviction. To the contrary, what the defendant wants to do is draw down on a 1997-1999 jail-time-served/banked-jail-time credit-line, as an offset to a later sentence imposed for the later committed, unrelated firearm convictions.

In November, 1993, the Milton defendant was found guilty of various assault and battery and disorderly conduct charges for which he was sentenced to two terms of one year and one term of six months, all concurrent. Id. at 19. The sentences were suspended, and the defendant was placed on two years' probation. Ibid. Then, in January, 1994, the Milton defendant was arrested for armed robbery and held in lieu of bail. Ibid. In March, 1995, the armed robbery charge was reduced to unarmed robbery, and the Milton defendant was acquitted on that reduced charge. Ibid. Six months later, in September, 1995, the Milton defendant was charged with disorderly conduct. Id. at 20.

The Milton defendant argued that he was entitled to credit on the resulting probation surrender sentence for the time that he had spent incarcerated while awaiting trial for the January, 1994, robbery charge, for which he was ultimately acquitted. The Supreme Judicial Court held to the contrary; it stated that ""the defendant is not entitled to receive credit for time he served awaiting trial on the robbery charge, to reduce the sentence imposed as the result of a crime he committed six months after his acquittal and discharge on the robbery charge."" Id. at 25.', 'In a process of alchemy, the defendant seeks to reconfigure the vacated 1997 drug-conviction sentence into so-called dead time, so that he can use the time that he served on that sentence, nunc pro tunc, as a line of credit for the later sentences on the 2003 firearm convictions. This, to me, strikes against the rationale of Manning, as well as Milton. Indeed, Milton states that ""the need to prevent criminal defendants from \'banking time\' for use against future sentences outweighs any fairness issues normally applicable in [dead time] situations."" Id. at 25.', 'Here, the defendant contends that it would be unfair for him to lose jail time credit and cites language in Williams, 463 Mass. at 632, which states, ""[W]here possible, in the interest of fairness, a prisoner should not be required to serve \'dead time.\' "" But, in asserting this fairness demand, the defendant  ignores the counterbalance set up in Williams, which is that, ""[w]hen faced with a request for jail time credit regarding unrelated offenses,"" the avoidance of dead time is merely one consideration. Ibid.', 'The overarching consideration, which tips the balance against the purported ""fairness"" of this defendant getting jail time credit, is that criminal defendants not ""establish[] a line of jail time credit that can be applied to future offenses."" Id. at 631. This counterbalancing consideration negates this defendant\'s fairness argument, as Manning, 372 Mass. at 395-396, and Milton, 427 Mass. at 25, indicate.', 'Finally, I note that, in support of its fairness analysis, the majority cites a series of cases from various Federal and other State jurisdictions to support the proposition that credit is due in this case. See ante at notes 13-15, and accompanying text. However,', 'Page 750', 'the cases cited and quoted from are quite distinguishable from the present case, as each involves a scenario where the defendant had two or more consecutive sentences, one of which was declared invalid while the defendant was still incarcerated.', 'This is not the issue here. Simply put, these cases do not address situations, like the present case, where a defendant seeks to credit time previously served against a current, nonconsecutive or nonconcurrent sentence.', 'Unlike the cases that the majority cites -- see, in particular, the heavy reliance on Federal cases, ante at 743-744 -- this case does not involve  consecutive ""from and after"" or concurrent sentences. Indeed, consecutive sentences -- which are not present here -- were central to the analysis in Manning, where the court determined that the time served on a series of invalidated concurrent sentences should be credited against a successive ""from and after"" sentence. See Manning, 372 Mass. at 388-389, 396. However, the vacating of an entirely unrelated conviction does not, I submit, immediately render the sentence dead time as to which a credit is in order. (As to the term ""dead time,"" see supra at note 4.) As stated in Manning, ""[a]n allowance for prison time previously served under a void commitment does not reduce sentences imposed as a result of new and different crimes.""

Both the judge and the prosecutor commented upon the directness of the juror\'s request to be  replaced by an alternate, and the prosecutor expressed surprise at how knowledgeable the juror was about the process. The prosecutor then stated that it might make sense to replace Juror 31 with an alternate, but that she would defer to the judge. After reviewing Juror 31\'s juror questionnaire, counsel for the codefendant remarked that Juror 31 seemed to be very well educated, and that he appeared to be the only Hispanic juror. Nevertheless, he agreed with the suggestion that Juror 31 be replaced with an alternate.', 'Page 765', 'Counsel for the defendant did not agree; he asked that Juror 31 remain. He expressed concern that Juror 31 was the only Hispanic juror in a case where both defendants were Hispanic, and that deliberations already had gone on for over a day. The prosecutor rejoined that if the only Hispanic juror had gotten sick, the judge would have no alternative but to seat an alternate. The judge agreed with the prosecutor, stating that he did not see how Juror 31\'s ""removal . . . at this time for reasons that he expressed as well as his personal request in any way sets a scene for the defendants to be denied a fair trial."" Over formal objection made by the defendant\'s attorney, the judge proceeded to excuse Juror 31 from further service.', 'Thereafter, the judge instructed the remaining jurors as follows. ""Ladies and gentlemen, for good reason I have removed a juror from your panel. We are about ready to replace him with an alternate."" The judge also instructed the  jury that they were to start their deliberations anew, explaining that this was necessary because the alternate had not been present, would be offering his views, and they needed to deliberate collectively. The defendant did not object to the judge\'s instruction.', 'At 11:45 A.M., an alternate was selected, and the jury were sent out to deliberate. An hour or so later, the jury reported that they had reached a verdict. At 1:04 P.M., it was announced in court that both defendants had been found guilty of armed robbery.', 'Discussion.

However, the judge ""has at most a limited discretion to determine that the facts show an inability to perform the functions of a juror, and that inability must appear in the record as a demonstrable reality."" Id. at 846-847 (quotation omitted). Finally, if and when  a deliberating juror is discharged, the judge must instruct the remaining jurors ""not only to begin deliberations anew (see G.

""Although a mistrial may be expensive in both human and monetary costs, it is not to be avoided by intrusion into the jury\'s domain."" Id. at 844. If it is not scrupulously determined that there is good cause for discharge, there is a risk that ""a dissenting juror [will be] allowed to evade [his] responsibilities,"" Commonwealth v.

There also is a risk that his replacement ""will feel a substantial coercive effect"" when joining other jurors who already have agreed upon the guilt or innocence of the accused. Commonwealth v. Olavarria, supra at 619-620. Furthermore, if, after discharge, the requisite instruction is not given, there is a risk that the remaining jurors will speculate that the juror was dismissed in order to make it possible for a verdict to be reached.', ""In this case, the appropriate procedures were not followed as to either the hearing or the judge's instruction following Juror 31's discharge. During the hearing, the judge did not inform Juror 31 that he could be discharged only if he had a personal problem; nor did the judge determine that Juror 31's stated  emotional distress resulted from personal issues unrelated to his views on the case or his relationship with his fellow jurors. Indeed, as the Commonwealth acknowledges, it appears from the record that the judge was not aware of the specific guidelines set forth in the Connor case. The Commonwealth nevertheless posits that the judge properly could discharge Juror 31 on the ground that he was unable to perform his function as a juror due to emotional distress. According to the Commonwealth, emotional distress was an appropriate, personal basis for dismissal,"", 'Page 768', 'because the juror\'s communications to the judge when questioned about note-taking indicated that he had ""a significant level of anxiety"" about serving as a juror even before deliberations began.', ""We are unpersuaded that the juror's remarks when questioned about his note-taking reflected any undue anxiety; they appear to be little more than an attempt to explain why he took notes when, whether he knew it or not, doing so was not permitted in that court room. But even if Juror 31's comments reflected some degree of concern about his ability to fulfil his duties conscientiously, the record is wholly inadequate to support the conclusion that he was suffering from severe emotional or mental distress -- beyond the level that often accompanies deliberations -- that would justify discharging him during the course of deliberations."", 'The facts of this case are significantly different from those in Commonwealth v. Leftwich,', ', 872-874 (2000), cited by the Commonwealth. In  Leftwich, prior to the start of the third day of deliberations, one of the jurors insisted upon speaking with the judge. During two subsequent colloquies, the juror informed the judge that she had spoken with her physician the prior afternoon because she was having great difficulty with stress, including difficulty breathing, and that she did not think she could continue to deliberate or be a fair juror. The judge noted that the juror was very emotionally distraught and was shaking ""from head to toe."" Id. at 873. Based upon the physical manifestations of stress observed by the judge, as well as the juror\'s own report of her distress, the judge determined that the juror was unable to continue deliberations and discharged her over the objection of the defendant. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the judge did not err or commit an abuse of discretion in discharging the juror, because, even without summoning the juror\'s physician or a court psychologist to examine the juror, the judge had sufficient basis to find that the juror was suffering from such extreme emotional distress that she could not perform her function as a juror. Also significant to the court\'s decision was that there was ""nothing in the record to indicate that the jury were at an impasse, or that the juror\'s statements were \'euphemisms\' for the fact that the juror was \'persistent', 'Page 769', 'in asserting a minority position during deliberations.\' "" Id. at 874, quoting from Commonwealth v. Connor, 392 Mass. at 846.', 'Here, on the other hand, but for Juror 31\'s ready agreement to the  judge\'s questions about the degree of the juror\'s distress and its effect upon his ability to assess and weigh the evidence, there is nothing in the record to establish that he was incapable of continuing to deliberate. His responses to the judge were rational and specific, including his request that he be ""removed and one of the alternates be put in [his] stead."" Furthermore, unlike the record in Leftwich, the record in the present case does contain indications of impasse. The jury reported being unable to reach a unanimous decision at the end of the first day of deliberations, and, despite seeking and obtaining supplemental instruction from the judge, they had yet to reach a verdict during the morning of the second day. Notably, after Juror 31 was discharged and replaced, the jury reached a verdict in little more than an hour, even though they were instructed to begin their deliberations anew.', ""On this record, we cannot discount the possibility that substantive disagreement about the case was at the root of Juror 31's emotional distress, and that both he and the other jurors (who, according to Juror 31, encouraged him to bring his request to the attention of the judge) were seeking a way for him to be excused. In sum, the discharge of Juror 31 -- to which the defendant timely objected -- was erroneously effectuated without a proper hearing and findings, was not an appropriate exercise of the judge's circumscribed discretion, and resulted in prejudice requiring reversal."", 'Separately and independently, the judge also erred in failing to instruct the  jury that the reason for Juror 31\'s dismissal was entirely personal and unrelated to his views about the case or his relationship with the remainder of the jury. The judge merely said that the defendant had been discharged for ""good reason."" Because the defendant did not object to the judge\'s instruction, we review only to determine whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See Commonwealth v. Zimmerman,', ', 150-152 (2004).', '""There will be occasions where the circumstances surrounding', 'Page 770', 'the dismissal of a deliberating juror will leave no room for speculation as to the reason for the discharge, such that the failure to give a Connor instruction is not error . . . . But such circumstances will be rare . . . ."" Id. at 151. See Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 677 (2005). This case does not present the rare circumstances necessary to deviate from the general rule.', ""Although the Commonwealth asserts that we can be confident that the remaining jurors were aware that Juror 31 was experiencing emotional distress and that he was discharged on that basis, that begs the question of the source of his emotional distress. Where the jury previously had informed the judge that they were unable to reach a verdict, it was particularly important that they be instructed that Juror 31's removal had nothing to do with his views on the case lest they speculate that he was removed because he was perceived to be an obstacle to their reaching a verdict. In the circumstances presented, the  absence of a proper instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See id. at 678. Contrast Commonwealth v.

The background facts as found by the judge after an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress are as follows.', 'On June 21, 2010, Chicopee police Lieutenant Lonny Dakin, an experienced narcotics investigator, procured a search warrant for the premises located at 212-214 Hampden Street, second-floor apartment, in Chicopee.', 'The defendant was the target of the warrant.', 'Dakin authored the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant. Read as a whole, the affidavit narrates the following. Within four months of June 21, 2010, Dakin spoke with a confidential informant. The informant told Dakin that the defendant was selling cocaine and pills from the second-floor apartment of 212-214 Hampden Street, which the defendant purportedly shared with another male. The informant stated that he or she had been to that location and personally purchased drugs from the defendant. The  informant would ""observe the defendant come down from the second floor apartment and sell to him on the porch."" The affidavit stated that ""[the informant] has also been to 212/214 Ham[p]den St. Chicopee, MA a couple of times with a third party. Sometimes the third party would go in to the second floor apartment to purchase from [the defendant] and sometimes [the defendant] would come out of the front door of 212/214 Hampden St. to sell to the third party.""', 'The informant described a pickup truck that the defendant drove. Surveillance by Dakin confirmed that the vehicle, registered to the defendant, was parked in the driveway of 212-214 Hampden Street.', 'Page 171', 'On June 14, 2010, the informant told Dakin that the defendant was still dealing cocaine and pills from the apartment and that within the past three days, the informant had seen the defendant enter the premises with three ounces of cocaine. Within three days of June 21, 2010, the informant told Dakin that he or she had seen the defendant leave the premises with approximately two ounces of cocaine, individually packaged for sale.', 'Dakin sought a search warrant for the second-floor apartment. The application described the premises as a three-story building with two exterior doors. One door led to a first-floor apartment and the other, Dakin believed, to a second-floor apartment.', 'The search warrant issued on June 21, 2010. Dakin chose not to execute the warrant immediately. Instead, he periodically traveled by the premises in the hope of spotting the defendant outside.', ""On June 24, 2010, Dakin, accompanied by Detective Donald LeClair, drove by the premises and observed the defendant exit the front door and proceed to his truck parked in the driveway. LeClair pulled his unmarked police vehicle behind the defendant's truck, blocking it in. Dakin exited the vehicle and approached the defendant, who was looking into the bed of the truck. Recognizing the defendant from a registry of motor vehicles' image, Dakin told him that he had a warrant to search his apartment and asked the defendant to accompany him inside."", 'The defendant led the officers to the front porch of the premises. On the porch, LeClair attempted to radio extra personnel to assist in the execution of the warrant. While LeClair was momentarily distracted, the defendant made a run for it. He did not get far. Running off the porch, he was tackled by Dakin on the sidewalk. A significant struggle ensued during which the defendant repeatedly yelled, ""Paul, Paul."" Eventually the defendant was subdued, handcuffed, and arrested for assault and battery on a police officer. Uniformed police officers arrived shortly thereafter.', 'LeClair entered the premises and proceeded to the second-floor apartment. A woman answered his knock on the door. LeClair asked the woman if Jason lived  there. She responded that he lived upstairs. LeClair noticed a stairway leading to a third-floor apartment. The stairs to the third-floor apartment were not', 'Page 172', 'visible from the front porch. LeClair left the premises and met with Dakin.', ""LeClair informed Dakin that the defendant lived on the third floor and that the search warrant was for the wrong apartment. On Dakin's direction, LeClair and an unidentified uniformed officer proceeded to the third-floor apartment. LeClair knocked on the door. It was answered by the defendant's roommate, Paul Cincone. Cincone, along with a female friend, Becky Gaumond, were in the apartment drinking beer and watching television. LeClair told Cincone that he had a warrant to search the apartment for narcotics. Cincone asked to see it. Knowing that the warrant was for the wrong apartment, LeClair did not show it to him. Instead, LeClair made a cursory check of the apartment for other occupants and then directed Cincone and Gaumond to accompany him outside. The unidentified uniformed officer remained in the apartment. Outside, LeClair and Dakin spoke with Cincone, who disavowed any knowledge of the defendant's cocaine-related activities but acknowledged that the defendant was growing marijuana in the apartment. Cincone, LeClair, and Dakin then returned upstairs to the apartment."", 'Cincone entered the kitchen and observed the uniformed officer standing in the doorway to the defendant\'s bedroom. Cincone was told to sit at the kitchen table, and he complied. From his vantage point,  Cincone was able to see the uniformed officer enter the defendant\'s bedroom and to hear the officer rummaging through papers. He also heard the officer exclaim, ""I think I found something.""', '', 'Dakin originally considered asking Cincone to sign a ""Consent to Search"" form but ultimately decided to obtain a search warrant for the third-floor apartment. To that end, he returned to the police station to redraft an affidavit in support of the application for a new search warrant. This second affidavit contained the identical information presented in the first affidavit but was supplemented by a recitation of the day\'s events, which included the confrontation and struggle with the defendant as well as the information supplied by Cincone. A new search warrant was issued authorizing a search of the third-floor apartment for ""[c]ocaine, marijuana, paraphernalia and other material utilized', 'Page 173', 'in the use, processing and sale of cocaine."" Dakin returned to the apartment, and with the assistance of other officers executed the warrant, which resulted in the discovery of the contraband.', 'Discussion. When challenging a search conducted pursuant to a warrant, the defendant has the burden of showing that evidence was obtained illegally. Commonwealth v. Taylor,', ', 280 (1981). The Massachusetts statute governing the content of search warrant affidavits requires suppression of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant not based on probable cause. See Commonwealth v. Upton,', ', 366-367 (1985), citing G. L. c. 276, §  2B.', '""Under the Aguilar-Spinelli standard, if an affidavit is based on information from an unknown informant, the magistrate must be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was \'credible\' or his information \'reliable\' (the veracity test)."" Id. at 374-375 (quotations and citations omitted). ""[O]ur inquiry as to the sufficiency of the search warrant application always begins and ends with the \'four corners of the affidavit.\' "" Commonwealth v. O\'Day,', ', 297 (2003), quoting from Commonwealth v. Villella,', ', 428 (1995).', ""Probable cause. The defendant argues that the affidavit supporting the second search warrant did not provide probable cause to believe that evidence of contraband would be found in the third-floor apartment because the informant's statements were stale, uncorroborated, and demonstrably false, and because tainted fruits of a prior illegal search were used to bolster the informant's information."", 'Specifically, the defendant argues that because the affidavit in support of the search warrant refers to information learned from a conversation that occurred up to 120 days prior to issuance of the warrant, the search warrant was based on stale information.', 'Page 174', ""The affidavit contained the informant's  statements made on June 14, 2010, seven days before the issuance of the warrant, that the defendant was continuing to sell cocaine and pills from the premises. The affidavit contained information that the informant had seen the defendant leave the premises within the previous three days with a bag containing individually packaged bags of cocaine. While affidavits in support of a search warrant must be closely related to the time of issuance of a warrant, time is of less significance where, as here, the defendant is engaged in an ongoing drug distribution business. See Commonwealth v. Colon,"", ', 170 (2011). We conclude that the information was not stale.', ""The defendant also argues that the discovery of the third-floor apartment by police undermined the informant's veracity and basis of knowledge as set forth in the affidavit. We disagree. In neither the first or second affidavit did Dakin state that the informant had been inside the defendant's apartment. It was a third party, not the informant, whom the informant observed entering the premises. Dakin's second affidavit contained the informant's observations that the defendant accessed his apartment through the same exterior entrance that a second-floor occupant would have used. Dakin's observation of the defendant leaving the building corroborated the informant's basis of knowledge, and the subsequent revelation that the defendant used an additional staircase once inside the premises compromises neither the informant's basis of knowledge nor veracity."", ""We agree with the motion judge's conclusion that the  search warrant affidavit established a nexus between the defendant's drug-selling activity and his residence sufficient to establish probable cause to search the apartment. See Commonwealth v. Gallagher,"", ', 59- 60 (2007). Cf. Commonwealth v. Medina,', '(2009) (no probable cause to search apartment where no facts connected drug sales to residence).', 'Even if the information obtained by the police officers during', 'Page 175', ""the execution of the first warrant should not have been included in the affidavit in support of the second warrant, the statements included in the second affidavit made by the defendant's roommate, which confirmed that the defendant lived on the third floor and grew marijuana, were not necessary to a determination of probable cause. There was sufficient probable cause based on the reliable informant, whose basis of knowledge was corroborated by police observations. In other words, that additional information provided in the affidavit supporting the second search warrant neither established nor detracted from the probable cause evident in the affidavit supporting the first search warrant."", ""The fact that the informant stated that he or she observed the defendant enter what appeared to be the door to the second-floor apartment was not fatal to the basis of knowledge prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test because police observed the defendant leave the premises using this door and discovered that the defendant's third-floor apartment was in fact accessible using this doorway."", 'Police misconduct. The defendant argued, and the motion judge agreed, that the initial entry and search by police was unconstitutional. The defendant argues on appeal that the police misconduct was sufficient to warrant suppression as a deterrent, citing Commonwealth v. Butler,', ', 525 (1996), and Commonwealth v. Lewin,', ', 586 (1989). This argument is unavailing. In Butler, supra at 525-526, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that any delay in the presentment of the defendant for arraignment was not so unreasonable as to require suppression of the defendant\'s statements. The court stated, however, that in other instances, it may be that ""if the police have engaged in misconduct . . . that would justify suppression as a deterrent against similar future conduct."" Id. at 525. In Lewin, the Supreme Judicial Court vacated a Superior Court judge\'s order dismissing charges against a defendant where the judge had concluded that dismissal was warranted because of egregious police misconduct in offering false information attributed to an informant. The court concluded that suppression of evidence might be warranted, but dismissal of the', 'Page 176', 'charges was not the proper remedy.', 'Commonwealth v. Lewin, supra at 586.', 'In the present case, police officers initially entered the third-floor apartment of 212-214 Hampden Street, Chicopee, knowing that the first search warrant was issued for the second-floor apartment. Even if exigent circumstances gave rise to the officers\' initial warrantless entry to secure  the third-floor apartment after the defendant attempted to alert Cincone of the police presence, the exigency dissipated once the known occupants were removed from the apartment and a cursory search revealed no other occupants. We agree with the motion judge, who concluded that instead of securing the third-floor apartment from the outside, the police reentered the apartment with Cincone and conducted an illegal search of the premises. ""[P]olice officers who secure a dwelling while a warrant is being sought . . . may not enter that dwelling, in the absence of specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed by removed or destroyed unless preventative measures are taken."" Commonwealth v. Webster,', ', 253 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. DeJesus,', ', 621 (2003). The warrantless entry and search by police provided no information necessary to the determination of probable cause. ""Evidence obtained during a search pursuant to a warrant that was issued after an earlier illegal entry and search is admissible as long as the affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant contains information sufficient to establish probable cause to search the premises \'apart from\' observations made during the initial illegal entry and search.""

In October of 2009, the defendant was charged with possession of a class A controlled substance (October case).  Less than one month later, in November of 2009, the defendant was again charged with possession of a class A controlled substance, possession with intent to distribute a class A controlled substance, resisting arrest, and assault and battery on a police officer (November case).  In February of 2010, the defendant pleaded guilty to the above charges, except for the possession of a class A controlled substance charge in the November case, which the Commonwealth dismissed.', 'In May of 2012, the defendant was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts with distribution of a controlled substance.  In March of 2013, the defendant moved to withdraw his guilty pleas in the October and November cases.  In his affidavits in support of the motions, the defendant claimed that his guilty pleas were not made intelligently and voluntarily because he and his attorney were not aware of the alleged misconduct of Sonja Farak, an assistant analyst at the Amherst laboratory who analyzed the narcotics in the October case.  The defendant also claimed that he was not shown the certificate of drug analysis (drug certificate) in either case.  However, at the time of his guilty pleas, a drug analysis had yet to be performed on the narcotics from the November case and the defendant instead stipulated that the 206 unanalyzed packets contained heroin.', 'Nonetheless, in his affidavit in support of his motion for new trial in the November case, the defendant claimed ""the analyst of the evidence in my case has engaged in material misconduct . . . and thus place[s] the validity of the evidence in my case in serious doubt."" After a nonevidentiary hearing, the judge allowed each motion with an endorsement.', 'b.  Crimes.  In the October case, the defendant was a passenger', 'Page 39', ""in a car that was stopped for a civil infraction.  He was not wearing a seat belt.  When the police officers ascertained the defendant's identity in order to issue him a citation, they discovered an outstanding warrant for his arrest.  During an inventory of his possessions at the police station, an officer found four glassine bags of heroin in the defendant's sock.  As stated above, the heroin was analyzed at the Amherst laboratory on December 21, 2009, by Farak."", 'In the November case, the police approached and spoke to the defendant, who was standing on a Holyoke street corner.  A State trooper who was present recognized the defendant as someone with whom he had had ""contact"" several days earlier.  An inquiry to the warrants management system revealed an outstanding arrest warrant for the defendant.  When the trooper attempted to handcuff the defendant, the defendant struck the trooper in the face and attempted to flee.  A violent struggle ensued and continued until backup officers arrived and handcuffed the defendant.  After the defendant was transported to the police station, 206 packets of heroin were found on the seat of the police cruiser.  At booking, the police recovered $1,308 from the defendant.', ""c.  Laboratory misconduct.  Attached to the Commonwealth's opposition to the defendant's motions were two police reports.  According to one report, on January 18, 2013, the State police began an investigation of the Amherst laboratory, which focused on Farak.  That investigation revealed Farak's mishandling of drug samples, improper storage of drug samples, and a belief that Farak had been removing narcotics from samples she had tested and replacing them with counterfeit substances.We take judicial notice of the fact that on January 6, 2014, Farak pleaded guilty to four counts of theft of a controlled substance from an authorized dispensary, four counts of tampering with evidence, and two counts of possession of a controlled substance."", '', '2.

Here, the defendant did not take issue with his plea colloquies, his understanding of the nature of the charges, or the consequences of the pleas.  Rather, he claimed that his guilty pleas were not intelligent and voluntary due to Farak\'s alleged malfeasance, which came to light in 2013.', ""The only support for the defendant's motions to withdraw his guilty pleas were his own self-serving affidavits.  In those affidavits, the defendant claimed he was not shown the drug certificates by his counsel.  He also averred that his counsel advised him that the identity of the substances (as an element of the crime) was not in doubt, and that the substances had been established to be heroin.  The defendant's motions were not accompanied by any drug certificate. However, the Commonwealth's opposition did provide a certificate for the October case, which revealed the assistant analyst to be Farak.  The defendant submitted nothing relative to the analysis of the substance in the November case."", ""In this posture, there was no support for any claimed laboratory misconduct involving the defendant's November case for possession with intent to distribute a class A controlled substance.  Indeed, there is no evidence that the 206 packets had even been analyzed before the defendant stipulated that they contained heroin when he pleaded guilty.

But that fact alone does not end the matter.  To evaluate the propriety of the judge granting the motion in the October case, we utilize the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's analysis in Ferrara v. United States, 456 F.3d 278, 290 (1st Cir. 2006), which has been adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v.

United States, supra at 291.', 'There can be no question that Farak\'s removal of narcotics from samples she had tested and replacing them with counterfeit substances constituted ""egregious misconduct"" by the government.  Although Farak\'s motives and the scale of her misconduct on this record differed from that of Annie Dookhan\'s in the Hinton laboratory cases, see Commonwealth v. Scott, supra at 337 & n.3, Farak\'s conduct nonetheless caused damage to the criminal justice process.  Also, like Dookhan, Farak was a government agent.  See id.at 348-350.  But the similarities end there. Under the first prong of the Ferrara analysis, a defendant ""must demonstrate that the misconduct occurred in his case.""  Id. at 350. In other words, ""a defendant seeking to vacate a guilty plea under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), on the ground that government misconduct rendered the plea involuntary, . . . is required to show a nexus between the government misconduct and the defendant\'s own case.""

The only evidence on this point appears in a police report appended to the Commonwealth\'s memorandum in opposition to the defendant\'s motion, and it indicates that Farak\'s misconduct occurred in 2013 -- more than three years after Farak analyzed the heroin in the defendant\'s case.  In other words, under the Ferrara analysis, the defendant failed to make the preliminary showing that the ""egregious government misconduct', 'the entry of his guilty plea.""  Commonwealth v. Scott, 467 Mass. at 347 (emphasis supplied).', ""The defendant's claim that the Commonwealth failed to provide the judge with any evidence that Farak's misconduct"", 'Page 44', ""did not precede the defendant's guilty pleas misperceives the burden of proof.

After informing the caller that the 911 line is recorded, the operator asked the caller, ""[W]hat is your emergency?""  The caller replied, ""Just a call, you got a drunk driver on Memorial Drive near Harvard', 'Page 107', 'Square and I\'ve got his license number, but he\'s swerving all over the road.""  The operator immediately transferred the call to the State police barracks in Brighton.  The caller stayed on the line and then spoke to a dispatcher who identified himself as Trooper Usom.  The motion judge found that the caller provided the color, make, and license plate number of the vehicle in question to Trooper Usom.', 'Trooper Usom then initiated the following broadcast:  ""H5, H5 patrols, one call erratic operation Memorial Drive westbound passing the Weeks Footbridge on MA PC 7785AN . . .

After the defendant pulled into the driveway, Trooper Dwyer parked his cruiser about five feet behind the defendant's vehicle and activated the cruiser's emergency lights."", 'The defendant stepped out of his vehicle and nearly fell to the ground.  When Trooper Dwyer approached the defendant he noticed that the defendant\'s hair was ""wild and unkept [sic]"" and detected an odor of alcohol.

In response to Trooper Dwyer\'s questions, the defendant said that he was coming from Cambridge and had driven on Soldier\'s Field Road and not Memorial Drive.

Trooper Dwyer then concluded that the defendant had been operating his motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and arrested him.', '', 'In denying the defendant\'s motion to suppress, the judge concluded that the 911 call was placed by ""an ordinary citizen -- not an informant -- who had witnessed a motor vehicle infraction, namely, a motor vehicle driving erratically on the roadway.""  Thus, even though the caller was not identified -- or identifiable -- the judge implicitly reasoned that the tip bore adequate indicia of reliability, because the caller\'s report was based on his personal knowledge, and the information he provided could be accorded more weight than information from an (anonymous) informant as a result of his status as an ordinary citizen.', 'The judge also found that the information provided by the caller had been corroborated by the police.

The question whether the police had an adequate basis for concluding the caller was reliable is a close one.  Although the initial 911 call was recorded, the Commonwealth presented no evidence to establish that the caller', 'Page 111', 'was identifiable.  There was no evidence that the telephone number used by the caller could be identified or that the caller otherwise knew the number could be traced.  As the defendant points out, the absence of evidence demonstrating that the caller\'s anonymity was at risk has resulted in a finding of unreliability in a number of cases.  See Commonwealth v. Mubdi, supra at 397 (Commonwealth failed to establish unidentified caller\'s reliability where there was ""no reason to believe the caller needed to fear that he or she would be subject to a charge of filing a false report or any comparable consequence of providing false information to law enforcement""); Commonwealth v.

Id. at 625.  The court stated that ""[w]hile the evidence does not reflect whether the caller knew of the robbery or saw the men wearing masks, we can infer the caller recognized that they appeared to have just committed a crime and were making their getaway; otherwise it would have made no sense to contact the police and provide the registration plate number of a departing vehicle.""  Id. at 623.  The court analogized the call to an excited utterance and concluded that the spontaneous and startled nature of the call heightened its reliability.

Commonwealth v. Anderson, supra at 624, quoting from Commonwealth v. Depina, 456 Mass. at 244.  Here, as in Anderson, the evidence supports the inference that the caller utilized the emergency number ""911"" for a valid reason, to report to the police what the caller understood to be a ""drunk"" driver operating a vehicle dangerously on a major thoroughfare, rather than for any malicious purpose that would lessen its reliability.  Commonwealth v. Anderson, supra at 623 n.9.  See Commonwealth v. Depina, supra at 245 (anonymous caller passed the veracity test where she reported a shooting in her backyard and witnessed a suspect fleeing, because the circumstances suggested that she did not intend to mislead the police).

We think it equally unlikely that a person bent on mischief or harassment would wait until he or she observed an enemy drive a car, and then accuse him or her of dangerous driving.', ""The fact that the caller's report bore sufficient indicia of reliability does not end our analysis.  We must still determine whether the reliable tip created a reasonable suspicion that the crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol had been or was being committed."", 'While there was no specific information provided by the caller regarding alcohol consumption, we can appropriately recognize that ""swerving all over the road"" is a significant indicator of drunk driving.', 'Here, Trooper Dwyer could reasonably suspect that the behavior reported by the caller was consistent with driving under the influence of alcohol and, because Trooper Dwyer knew that the defendant was on probation for drunk driving, he had the requisite reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop, even though he had not personally observed any suspicious behavior.

The description of the men involved in the home invasion had included two men of color, dressed in dark clothing, with one man wearing a hooded sweatshirt.  We acknowledge that the description was somewhat general and lacking in detail.  Nonetheless, two men who fit that description were seen on the street some nine or ten blocks away, within only about thirty minutes of the report of the crime.  It was twenty-three degrees outside and none of the officers had seen anyone else walking on the street since the report.  The relatively close proximity of the defendant to the time and place of the reported crime, together with the fact that the officers saw no one else on the streets on that cold evening, furnishes further justification for a threshold inquiry.  Moreover, once the defendant started to run for a second time, to again avoid interaction with the investigating officers, Officer Carr had reasonable suspicion that the defendant was involved in the reported home invasion, meriting further inquiry to confirm or dispel that suspicion.', '', '""Neither evasive behavior, proximity to a crime scene, nor matching a general description is alone sufficient to support the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a stop and frisk. . . .  Each of these factors may, however, be considered by the police, and in combination may allow the police to narrow the range of suspects to particular individuals.""  Commonwealth v. Mercado, 422 Mass. at 371.  In this case, the facts, examined in combination, compare favorably to those in stops that have been upheld by the courts.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Depina, 456 Mass. at 245-247.  To make an investigatory stop based on a physical description, the description cannot be so general that it would include a large number of people in the area where the stop occurs, nor need it be so particularized as to fit only a single person, provided other accompanying circumstances are present.  See id. at 246-247.  Here, as in Depina, the description of the perpetrators, together with the spatial and temporal proximity of the defendant and his companion to the scene of the home', 'Page 483', ""invasion, the defendant's twice reversing direction and running away upon encountering the police, and the gravity of the crime under investigation gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that justified Officer Carr's stop of the defendant.

McKoy,"", ', 312-313 (2013), where the facts supporting reasonable suspicion were considerably weaker than those in the present case, but still supported reasonable suspicion (anonymous report of shots fired, no description at all given about potential suspects; two men in hooded sweatshirts, the only people on the street at that time, were walking in cold and snowy weather not far from the scene of the crime).', 'In sum, in the present case we see most of the Doocey factors.  While the description itself was not precise, the fact that there were two individuals who fit it, rather than one, enhances its value.  Contrast Commonwealth v. Cheek,', ', 496 (1992).  In addition, the defendant and his companion were close in time and proximity to the location of the report of a serious crime, and the ""population of individuals in the area at the relevant time"" included only the defendant and his companion.  Commonwealth v. Doocey, 56 Mass. App. Ct. at 554.

To this day, that remains unestablished as the defendant is not charged with the breaking and entering that precipitated these events.  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.', 'A.  Geography.  In order to understand why the initial encounter between Officer Anjos and the two black males did not contribute in any objective sense to reasonable suspicion that they were', 'Page 488', 'involved in the burglary on Hutchings Street, a consideration of the local geography is instructive.  Two maps of the neighborhood in question were downloaded from Google Maps', 'and were received in evidence at the suppression hearing.  Using the same source,', 'I considered first, a broader, less magnified view, and second, an abridged and enlarged view pinpointing the points of interest in this series of events.  See Appendix A and B.', 'The following observations are significant.  First, only the victim or his foster mother could have supplied the police with firsthand knowledge about the path of flight of the three perpetrators.  Looking out to the street from the victim\'s bedroom window, one\'s ability to see where the perpetrators may have gone is very limited.  According to the evidence, it was a backyard window and allowed one to see only twelve to fifteen yards, up to the corner where Hutchings and Harold Streets intersect.  Officer Anjos testified on redirect that the victim ""observed them running towards Harold Street and he wasn\'t sure whether they went down Walnut or Seaver, but he believed it was either one of those streets.""  The prosecutor then asked, ""So he [the victim] saw them run down Harold Street, but he was guessing as to where they might have gone from there?""  To which Anjos responded, ""Yes, he was.""  These alleged directions of flight, beyond Harold Street, were based on the victim\'s guess and not on his observation.', 'Second, there was testimony by Officer Anjos that approximately twenty-five minutes elapsed from the time of the initial 911 telephone call to when he first encountered the two black males about one mile from the scene of the crime.  The perpetrators could have fled in any one of several directions.  Assuming they were traveling on foot, they could have traveled to any', 'Page 489', 'location within a circle with a radius of approximately two miles in which the center point is the intersection of Hutchings Street and Harold Street.  This area is so large that it extends beyond the boundaries of Roxbury and into the Dorchester and Jamaica Plain sections of Boston.  See Appendix A.  See also post at 499 n.1 (Rubin, J., dissenting).', 'Third, Officer Anjos testified at the suppression hearing that the victim reported that the perpetrators were seen ""running down Hutchings towards Harold Street in the direction of Seaver or Walnut Avenue.""  The judge found that the victim ""stated he saw them run down Hutchings Street towards Seaver Street.  One black male ran towards Walnut"" Avenue.  The majority states that the victim reported the ""men ran down Hutchings Street -- which could have led them either to Seaver Street or to Walnut Avenue.""  Ante at 477.  While, as noted supra, the view from the victim\'s bedroom was limited, a person running down Hutchings Street could navigate his way to Walnut Avenue or to Seaver Street.  However, Walnut Avenue, like Seaver Street, winds its way through Roxbury, crossing many other streets, and is more than one mile in length, running both to the north and to the south of the crime scene.  See Appendix B.  Furthermore, as Officer Anjos candidly observed on cross-examination, Seaver Street from Hutchings Street is in the opposite direction of the Dale Street area where the arrest occurred.  Thus, knowledge that one, two, or three black males wearing dark clothing who were involved in a breaking and entering at a home near the intersection of Hutchings Street and Harold Street, fled toward Seaver Street or Walnut Avenue, even if the information is presumed reliable, is not, absent a description of their height, weight, age, facial features, distinctive clothing, or other distinguishing characteristics,', 'probative of whether two black males wearing dark clothing encountered about thirty minutes later near the intersection of Walnut Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, were connected to the breaking and entering.', 'Fourth, the majority also relies on the fact that Officer Anjos testified that when he left the crime scene he ""began to drive around the area"" and saw no one else on the street until he was driving back to the police station and encountered the two males', 'Page 490', 'in question.  Ante at 477-478.  Anjos explained at the hearing that he traveled ""up and down Harold Street, Walnut Avenue, Holworthy, onto MLK Boulevard.""  These streets are shown on the maps in the Appendix.  They are only a small subset of the area in the circle with a two-mile radius, within which the perpetrators may have fled.  The majority attaches significance to the fact that Officer Anjos testified that he did not see anyone out on the streets.  Ante at 477-478.  However, on cross-examination, he admitted that during the course of radio communications regarding this incident, Sergeant Christopher Bailey broadcast a report ""that he saw one kid with a backpack on Seaver between Blue Hill Avenue and Elm Hill Avenue.""', 'B.

Cheek,', ', 496 (1992), the Supreme Judicial Court observed:', '""[T]he description of the suspect as a \'black male with a black ¾ length goose\' could have fit a large number of men who reside in the Grove Hall section of Roxbury, a predominantly black neighborhood of the city.  The officers possessed no additional physical description of the suspect that would have distinguished the defendant from any other black male in the area such as the suspect\'s height and weight, whether he had facial hair, unique markings on his face or clothes, or other identifying characteristics.  That the jacket matched was not enough to single him out.

L. c. 41, § 98, that authorized the criminal prosecution of persons found on the street during the nighttime in circumstances in which the arresting officer suspected the person of ""unlawful design,"" id. at 290, and was not satisfied with the person\'s explanation for being abroad in the nighttime, ibid.  Although the court reasoned that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give an ordinary person adequate notice of what conduct was proscribed, the court made the following observation, which is of special significance in this case:  ""The problem with suspicion is that it is a subjective term incapable of providing any intelligible standard to guide either suspect or court.  The absence of limiting standards leaves the citizen at the \'mercy of the officers\' whim or caprice.\'""  Id. at 292-293, quoting from Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176 (1949).

Given the coincidence of finding two black males who were dressed in dark clothing, one of whom was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, on a Roxbury street at 9:30 P.M. on a winter evening, the additional consideration that they jogged away when Officer Anjos attempted to', 'Page 494', 'speak with them and, moments later, ran away at the approach of Officers Carr and Santosuosso,', 'is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to support a stop.  In the absence of other factors indicating that a person has, is, or is about to commit a crime, flight from the police adds no weight to the calculation of reasonable suspicion.

We do not agree that the challenged evidence was irrelevant.', '""It is undoubtedly true that, had there been no evidence of an official police policy of \'searches on sight,\' evidence that the officers directly involved in this case or other officers on various occasions conducted unconstitutional searches would not have been relevant.  Standing alone, evidence of those isolated events would not have increased the likelihood that the challenged search was unlawful. . . .  However, the evidence of specific instances of constitutionally unreasonable \'on sight searches\' tends to support the further evidence of an official policy approving such procedures and, in our view, the evidence of that official policy was relevant.

Reasonable suspicion summary.  In the present case, when Officer Anjos first encountered the defendant and another person near the intersection of Walnut Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, Officer Anjos was not nearby the crime scene as the majority asserts.

Moreover, the only similarity between the two males Officer Anjos encountered and the description of the perpetrators of the breaking and entering was their race and the fact that they wore dark clothing and one man wore a hooded sweatshirt.  There was nothing unusual or out of place about their clothing.  The two males were walking, not running.  The two males were not carrying anything that might suggest a connection to the crime, nor otherwise acting in a suspicious manner.  Officer Anjos made no other observation that would indicate that the two males were engaged in criminal activity.  The two males did not flee upon seeing the marked cruiser, but jogged away only when Officer Anjos asked them to wait.  When, moments later, the males encountered the other two officers, the defendant began to run.  These circumstances, while sufficient to raise suspicion, do not establish the degree of individualized suspicion that a crime has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur to justify a detention for a threshold inquiry.', 'The majority seeks to buttress its view that Officer Anjos acted on the basis of reasonable suspicion by reference to the inventory of relevant factors we identified in Commonwealth v. Doocey,', 'Page 498', '', ', 554-556 (2002).  Ante at 481.  I agree that Doocey is instructive, but in my view it points to the opposite result.  Officer Anjos lacked a particularized description of the perpetrators, he canvassed only a portion of the area within which the perpetrators could have fled before he fixed his sights on the defendant and his companion, Officer Anjos did not encounter the males near the scene of the crime, he did not encounter them immediately after the commission of the crime, the suspects were not the only black males seen by the police on the streets at the time, and the character of the park into which the males fled does not contribute to the likelihood that they were involved in a recent breaking and entering.', 'Because the defendant and his companion were not targeted for investigation due to their presence in a high crime area, the only Doocey factor that Officer Anjos could rely on was the defendant\'s flight.  It is settled that a person is under no obligation to cooperate with the police when asked to stop and to submit to a threshold inquiry.  Officer Anjos had every right to harbor a subjective belief that the two men he encountered were involved in the breaking and entering on Hutchings Street.  Good police work often begins with a hunch.  However, a hunch that criminal activity is underway because individuals choose to run away instead of declining, politely, an invitation to stop and to converse does not justify a seizure.  The fact that the actions taken by the police in this case resulted in the seizure of a loaded firearm is of no consequence because ""[a] search prosecuted in violation of the Constitution is not made lawful by what it brings to light; the doctrine has never been recognized by this Court, nor can it be tolerated under our constitutional system.""

Indeed, at the hearing on the motion to suppress, the arresting officer disclaimed having concluded that these individuals were suspects in the burglary \x96 he would state only that Officer Anjos had reached that conclusion.  Although of course reasonable suspicion must be measured on facts and circumstances known to police officers prior to the seizure, in this case it can come as no surprise that these two individuals never have been linked in any way to the burglary of which Officer Anjos testified he suspected them.', 'As I said at the outset, and as appears undisputed here, it is impermissible for the police to stop any two black men walking on the street wearing hoodies simply because thirty minutes earlier and one mile away two black men in dark clothing, at least one of whom was wearing a hoodie, were among three men involved in a burglary.

Id. at 798-799.  Nanny rejects the Commonwealth's principal argument in this case that § 54 authorized it to commence the case against the defendant by means of a YO indictment.  In Nanny, 462 Mass. at 800, the court explained that prior to 1996, Massachusetts law provided that in order to prosecute as an adult a person who was a juvenile at the time an offense was committed, a Juvenile Court judge had to conduct a transfer hearing first under G. L. c. 119, § 61, repealed by St. 1996, c. 200, § 7.  In all such instances, the case against the juvenile began when a Juvenile Court complaint was issued.  The 1996 amendment of G. L. c. 119, § 54, which governs this case,"", '""was aimed primarily at \'address[ing] growing concern[s] about violent crimes committed by juveniles,\' by creating a youthful offender classification.  The concurrent repeal of § 61, and amendment of § 54, allowed prosecutors to \'proceed [directly] against a child by indictment in a Juvenile Court if the child [was] considered a ""youthful offender,""\' without having to request a transfer after a hearing from a Juvenile Court judge.""', 'Id. at 800-801 (citations omitted).  Although the 1996 amendment creating the YO category streamlined the process by means of which a juvenile could be indicted and subject to adult penalties for certain violent offenses, it did not change preexisting law which required that a juvenile complaint be obtained to initiate the case.  In Nanny, 462 Mass. at 801-802, the court held that before a juvenile can be indicted as a YO, there must be a transfer hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 119, § 72A.  In Nanny, the court also specifically rejected the Commonwealth\'s argument, renewed in the present case, that § 72A applies only to cases in which the Commonwealth has elected to initiate the proceedings by complaint, leaving the Commonwealth free in other cases to directly indict a juvenile as a YO under § 54 without first conducting a transfer hearing under G. L.   c. 119, § 72A.  ""Under the clear language of the statute, once the two conditions that trigger § 72A are satisfied, \'', 'in the Juvenile Court\'"" (emphasis original).  Nanny, 462 Mass. at 802, quoting', 'Page 815', 'from Porges, 460 Mass. at 528.', '', 'Despite the detailed statutory analysis by the Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v. Nanny, 462 Mass. at 799-806, the Commonwealth argues that the holding in Nanny leaves room for a different outcome in this case because unlike in Nanny, the defendant not only had the benefit of a probable cause determination by the grand jury, but also had the benefit of a hearing before a Juvenile Court judge that met the requirements of G. L. c. 119, § 72A.', ""In Nanny, supra at 805, unlike in the present case, the Commonwealth sought to bypass the requirement of a § 72A transfer hearing by arguing that a grand jury's determination of probable cause was equivalent to or at least satisfied § 72A's requirement of a probable cause determination. The court in Nanny rejected this argument.  Ibid."", 'In Nanny, the court also indicated that the avoidance of a transfer hearing deprived the defendant of the safeguards under the second prong of § 72A in that the discretion exercised by a judge after a § 72A transfer hearing is more expansive than the sentencing discretion exercised by a judge after a person is tried and convicted on an indictment, because one option available to a judge in a § 72A hearing is to discharge the defendant from any further prosecution.  Id. at 805-806.  The record before us indicates that the judge properly addressed the issues that should be addressed at the close of a § 72A hearing.', 'However, Nanny is not the final word from the Supreme Judicial Court on the jurisdictional requirements in cases in which the offender was a juvenile when the offense was committed but is not apprehended until after he turns eighteen.  In Commonwealth v. Mogelinski,', ', 628 (2013) (Mogelinski), the Supreme Judicial Court answered the precise question before us:  ""[w]hether an individual may be indicted as a youthful offender', 'Page 816', 'after he has turned 18, for offenses he allegedly committed between the ages of 14 and 17?""  The court answered the question ""no.""  Id. at 629.  In Mogelinski, although Juvenile Court complaints charging the defendant with rape of a child were initially obtained before the defendant\'s eighteenth birthday, by the time of his arraignment on those complaints he had turned eighteen years of age.  Id. at 629.  However, while the delinquency complaints were still pending in the Juvenile Court, the Commonwealth obtained YO indictments against the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 119, § 54.  Ibid.  The delinquency complaints were eventually nolle prossed.  Id. at 630.  In Mogelinski, the court explained that under the law applicable in this case (prior to the amendment of G. L. c. 119 by St. 2013, c. 84, see note 5, supra), when a person is a juvenile at the time the offenses are committed and when he is apprehended', '(even if he turns eighteen while the case is pending), and the offenses consist of one or more violent crimes other than murder, the Commonwealth can proceed along either of two tracks:  a juvenile complaint or a YO indictment, with significant differences in terms of the dispositional options available to the judge and the safeguards available to the juvenile.  Id. at 631-632.  The distinctions between the two tracks are significant.', 'However, once the person turns eighteen before he is first apprehended (as in this case), the offender can still be prosecuted in the Juvenile Court, but the Commonwealth no longer retains the two options noted earlier. ""While proceedings under either a delinquency complaint or a youthful offender indictment presuppose that an individual is under the age of eighteen when the proceeding is commenced, the Commonwealth is not precluded from prosecuting individuals who are \'apprehended\' after their eighteenth birthdays for offenses committed prior to turning seventeen.  See G. L. c. 119, § 72A. In such cases,', 'Page 817', 'the Commonwealth first must file a delinquency complaint and obtain a transfer hearing in the Juvenile Court.""  Mogelinski, 466 Mass. at 632.', 'The question for us therefore is the consequence of failing to obtain a juvenile complaint against the defendant who had turned eighteen years of age before he was apprehended but who had the benefit of a transfer hearing that conformed to G. L.  c. 119, § 72A, in all other respects, an indictment by a grand jury, and a jury trial?  The answer, again is supplied by the Supreme Judicial Court in Mogelinski:  ""Ultimately, the Juvenile Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, which \'has no . . . authority in the absence of a specific statutory authorization.\'""  Id. at 645, quoting from Commonwealth v. A Juvenile,', ', 34 (1989).', ""Here, without the prior issuance of a juvenile complaint, the Juvenile Court lacked the authority to proceed on a direct indictment of the defendant as a YO and to transfer the defendant's case to adult court.

After an evidentiary hearing, a District Court judge found the following.  On October 17, 2013, State Trooper', 'Page 69', 'Edmund Hartwell was assigned alone and in uniform to a cruiser patrol.  That morning, Hartwell was parked on Everett Avenue, opposite Chelsea High School, observing traffic.  While parked, Hartwell saw a red sport utility vehicle (SUV) go past.  Hartwell noticed that the driver, who was later identified as the defendant, Govanny Ramos, was not wearing a seatbelt and appeared to have his hands in his lap.  Hartwell ""ran"" the registration of the SUV using his mobile data terminal (MDT) to query the RMV database.  The vehicle ""came back stolen.""  The description of the motor vehicle in the RMV database matched the SUV Hartwell observed.  Hartwell followed the SUV and contacted the dispatch center at the State police headquarters in Danvers to get confirmation that the SUV was stolen.  The dispatch center confirmed that the SUV with the particular registration plate and description was reported as stolen.', ""Hartwell followed the SUV until it turned into a driveway to a residential building on Addison Street and stopped.  He activated his lights and siren when the SUV began to turn into the driveway, and then pulled partially into the driveway behind the SUV.  There was a fence in front of and along the driver's side of the SUV.  The defendant opened the driver's side door and got out of the SUV, tossing a small plastic bag with a green leafy substance on the ground.  Hartwell directed the defendant to come towards him, and the defendant complied.  Hartwell told the defendant that he was going to place him in custody to discuss the situation; he then handcuffed the defendant.  Hartwell advised the defendant of his Miranda rights, which the defendant said he understood.  While in custody at the scene, the defendant explained to Hartwell that he had borrowed the vehicle from a friend, Joel Rodriguez, and that the vehicle belonged to Rodriguez's girlfriend.  Hartwell then placed the defendant under arrest.  The defendant was charged in District Court with unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, in violation of G. L. c. 90, § 10, and receiving a stolen motor vehicle, subsequent offense, in violation of G. L. c. 266, § 28(a)."", 'Claiming violation of the rights guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the defendant moved to suppress evidence that resulted from the stop and warrantless search by the State police including, but not limited to, statements made by the defendant, any actions of the defendant, any observations of', 'Page 70', 'police officers, and any other evidence that resulted from his seizure and subsequent search.  A District Court judge, citing Lopes, 455 Mass. at 154-156, allowed the defendant\'s motion and found that the stop of the defendant\'s vehicle was not justified because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the information Hartwell received from the RMV database satisfied the familiar Aguilar-Spinelli test ""demonstrating a sufficient basis of knowledge of the source of the information (the basis of knowledge test) and the underlying circumstances demonstrating that the source of the information was credible or the information reliable (veracity test).""  See Lopes, supra at 155-156.  The Commonwealth then filed an application for leave to appeal, which a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed.  See Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), as appearing in  422 Mass. 1501  (1996).  In this interlocutory appeal, the Commonwealth contends that the judge erred by applying the Aguilar-Spinelli test and allowing the defendant\'s motion to suppress.  We agree.', 'Discussion.  ""In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\'s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \'but conduct an independent review of [the judge\'s] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\'""  Lopes, 455 Mass. at 153, quoting from Commonwealth v. Scott,', ', 646 (2004).', 'Police officers may make a traffic stop when they have ""a reasonable, articulable suspicion that a person in a vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Greenwood,', ', 616, cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 327 (2011).  This suspicion ""must be based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.""  Commonwealth v. Ancrum,', ', 651 (2006).  Our analysis is ultimately a practical one.  See Lopes, 455 Mass. at 158-159.  In this case, Hartwell used his MDT to learn that the SUV the defendant was driving was listed as stolen in the RMV database.  He saw that the description of the SUV in the database matched the SUV Hartwell observed.  He pursued the inquiry further by contacting the dispatch center, which confirmed that the SUV with the particular registration plate and description was reported as stolen.  Whether Hartwell had reasonable suspicion based on the stolen motor vehicle record in the RMV database depends on whether it was reasonable for Hartwell to rely on the information that the SUV was stolen.', 'The defendant argues that the information provided by the RMV database and the dispatch center amounts to information', 'Page 71', 'from an anonymous informant that requires a further showing of reliability and credibility under the Aguilar-Spinelli test before it can be relied on by the police.  See Commonwealth v. Costa,', ', 514-515 (2007).  However, because Hartwell\'s stop was based on information gained from the RMV database through his MDT and not from information gained from an informant, ""the usual rule applies that upholds an arrest on otherwise reliable information . . . .""  Commonwealth v. Wilkerson,', ', 141 (2002) (Wilkerson).', '', 'Here, the RMV records that formed the basis of Hartwell\'s reasonable suspicion have sufficient indicia of reliability on which to predicate a traffic stop.  See Wilkerson, 436 Mass. at 141-142.  Indeed, RMV records are generally considered reliable.  See ibid. (holding that it was reasonable for police officer to rely on RMV record when making arrest for motor vehicle offense).  The court in Wilkerson concluded that the police had ""no basis to question"" the results of the query to the RMV ""or to verify it independently.""  Id. at 142.  In addition, we note that the law promotes the reliability of reports of stolen vehicles by punishing false reports and requiring the owner of a stolen motor vehicle to sign and submit to the police ""a statement under the penalties of perjury . . . relating to the theft or misappropriation of the vehicle.""  G. L. c. 266, § 29, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 463, § 4.  See G. L. c. 268, § 39.  Furthermore, anyone who makes a written statement to the RMV alleging the theft of a motor vehicle does so on a signed form that gives printed notice that false statements are punishable under penalty of perjury, subjecting the individual to criminal liability.  G. L. c. 268, § 39.  See Commonwealth v. Kelly,', ', 753-754 (2007) (describing stolen vehicle report form).  Because false reports of motor vehicles are punished by statute, it is both reasonable and practical to assume that reports of stolen vehicles to the RMV are reliable.', 'Our conclusion is aligned with the foundation of the exclusionary', 'Page 72', 'rule -- an interest in deterring unlawful police conduct.  See Wilkerson, 436 Mass. at 142.  This ""interest . . . is not implicated where police rely on records of an independent State agency, such as the registry [RMV], to make an otherwise proper arrest.""  Ibid.  It was reasonable for Hartwell to rely on the information from the RMV database because it had sufficient indicia of reliability and, thus, was sufficient to give Hartwell reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop.  Because the stop of the defendant was supported by reasonable suspicion based on reliable information, the stop was justified and did not violate the defendant\'s rights under the Declaration of Rights, art. 14, or the Fourth Amendment.', 'Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.']"

Here, by contrast, the suspicious way the defendant held his waistband, the location in which he was walking, and his turning away from the police when they approached him were sufficiently suspicious that, when combined with his flight, they provided the police with the reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that a crime was afoot necessary to allow the stop of the defendant.

In Dunn, the United States Supreme Court set out four factors to be considered when deciding whether a particular area is within the curtilage of a particular home:  ""(1) the proximity of the area to the home, (2) whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, (3) the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and (4) the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observations by people passing by.""

Crayton,"", ', 241 (2014), should be applied:  ""Where an eyewitness has not participated before trial in an identification procedure, we shall treat the in-court identification as an in-court show up, and shall admit it in evidence only where there is \'good reason\' for its admission.""', 'The Supreme Judicial Court announced a prospective rule in Crayton to be applied in trials that commence after the issuance', 'Page 573', ""of the opinion on December 17, 2014.  See id. at 241-242.  Because the defendants' trial took place before the issuance of Crayton, the prospective rule does not apply and, instead, we evaluate the alleged errors under the law at the time of the trial.  See Commonwealth v. Bastaldo,"", ', 31 (2015).', '""We recognize that a degree of suggestiveness inheres in any identification of a suspect who is isolated in a court room.  Nevertheless, such isolation does not, in itself, render the identification impermissibly suggestive.""  Commonwealth v. Napolitano,', ', 604 (1979), abrogated by Crayton.Prior to Crayton, long standing case law held that an in-court identification was excluded only where ""it is tainted by an out-of-court confrontation . . . that is \'so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\'""  Commonwealth v. Carr,', ', 877 (2013), quoting from Commonwealth v. Choeurn,', ', 520 (2006).  See Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, (1968).  ""An in-court identification was admissible in the absence of any prior out-of-court confrontation.""  Bastaldo, supra.  Here, the first time Demers made a formal identification of the defendant was in court during his testimony.  Demers\' only out-of-court encounter with the defendants took place during the controlled buy.  Demers met Carlos on the street outside of his home in broad daylight then proceeded to his apartment where he spent three to four minutes with Carlos and Lylibeth while completing the drug transaction.  Demers spoke with both defendants and had an opportunity to view them from both inside and outside the house for an extended period of time.  There was nothing suggestive about the controlled buy with the defendants that would create a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification in court.', 'The defendants also argue that even if Crayton is not applied, ""[c]ommon law principles of fairness dictate that an unreliable identification arising from . . . especially suggestive circumstances . . . should not be admitted.""  Commonwealth v. Jones,', "", 109 (1996).  As discussed above, there was nothing unreliable about Demers' opportunity to observe the defendants."", 'Other arguments regarding the in-court identifications relied on by the defendants, ""but not discussed in this opinion, have not been overlooked.  We find nothing in them that requires discussion.""  Commonwealth v. Domanski,', "", 78 (1954).  There was no error in the admission of Demers' in-court identification."", 'Page 574', 'b.  Sufficiency of evidence.  The defendants moved for a required finding of not guilty at the close of all of the evidence.  Additionally, Carlos filed a posttrial motion for required findings.  In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding, we examine the relevant evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and ask whether ""any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 677 (1979).', 'i.  Chain of custody.  The defendants argue that there was an insufficient chain of custody to connect the substance seized from the controlled buy to the heroin presented at trial.  In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether the evidence presented supports a finding that the defendants knowingly or intentionally distributed heroin and whether Carlos knowingly possessed heroin.', 'Detective Purpora testified that he conducted two other controlled buys on May 15, 2014, culminating with the one in question.  He stated that the controlled buy from the defendants took place at 129 Water Street at around 1:00 P.M.  However, the evidence submission form, which was completed to accompany the contraband to the laboratory, referred to the general time and area where the controlled buys were conducted as 12:00 P.M. and ""50 Broadway Street.""  The defendants view this as a fatal defect.  Detective Purpora, however, had distinguished the three bags seized from the defendants from the contraband seized at the other controlled buys by writing the defendants\' names on the envelope containing the heroin.  Clark analyzed the contents of the envelope with the defendants\' names on it and confirmed that the plastic bags seized were in fact heroin.  An item of real evidence must be authenticated or identified as the thing the proponent represents it to be.  See Commonwealth v. LaCorte,', ', 704, (1977).  ""If the object is one the witness can particularly identify, it will be sufficient, see Commonwealth v. Andrews,', ', 462 (1988), if not, it becomes necessary for the witness to have placed an identifying mark or label thereon or to otherwise create a \'chain of custody\' that will help authenticate the item.""  Commonwealth v. Herring,', ', 365 (2006).  Detective Purpora testified about where and how he seized the heroin.  He also testified about the retention of the heroin and the delivery of it to the Massachusetts State police forensic services group.  Finally, Clark testified as to its identity and quantity.  The evidence is sufficient to permit a finder of fact', 'Page 575', 'to conclude that the evidence seized was in fact collected from the defendants during the controlled buy, that they knowingly distributed the heroin, and that Carlos knowingly possessed it.', '""[A]lleged defects in the chain of custody usually go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.""  Commonwealth v. Viriyahiranpaiboon,', ', 230 (1992).  The judge allowed the defendant to suggest to the jury in his opening statement, in cross-examinations of multiple witnesses, and in his closing argument that the alleged defect in the chain of custody should result in an acquittal.  This testimony was sufficient to permit a finder of fact to conclude that the defendants committed the charged offenses.', 'c.  School zone violation.  Finally, Lylibeth argues that the judge erred by allowing the Commonwealth to admit a map and expert testimony about the map because the Commonwealth did not provide notice of its intent to do so.  The defendant preserved the issue for appeal with a timely objection.  Therefore we review the error, if any, to determine if it prejudiced Lylibeth.  See Commonwealth v. Cruz,', ', 591 (2005).', 'The Commonwealth did not provide the defendants with pretrial notice of the map that was admitted in evidence through the city engineer\'s testimony.  However, the defense had the opportunity to extensively cross-examine the engineer about the map certification process as well as the reliability of the map.  ""Where a defendant is able to cross-examine a witness extensively, prejudice is \'effectively\' removed.""  Commonwealth v. Molina,', ', 236-237 (2009).  Additionally, it is unlikely the defendant could show prejudice in light of the fact that she was on notice from the time of her indictment that the Commonwealth intended to prosecute the school zone violation.  ""There must be a demonstration of how the information would have aided the defendant \'in preparing and presenting\' [her] case.""  Id. at 236, quoting from Commonwealth v. Stote,', ', 25 (2000).  In measuring prejudice to a defendant when the prosecution has delayed its disclosure of evidence prior to trial, ""it is the consequences of the delay that matter, not the likely impact of the nondisclosed evidence.""  Stote, supra at 23, quoting from Commonwealth v. Wilson,', "", 114 (1980).  Furthermore, the Commonwealth outlined the anticipated substance and basis of the engineer's testimony in their opening statement and Lylibeth did not object.  We conclude there was no error in the admission of the map"", 'Page 576', 'and related testimony, but if there was, it was not unfairly prejudicial.', 'Judgments affirmed.']"

Admissibility of ambulance and hospital records.  This appeal requires us to consider the application of two statutes governing the admissibility of medical records:  G. L. c. 233, § 79, and G. L. c. 233, § 79G.  Section 79, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 200, provides that ""[r]ecords kept by hospitals, dispensaries or clinics, and sanatoria under section seventy of chapter one hundred and eleven shall be admissible . . . so far as such records relate to . . . treatment and medical history.""  So long as they are ""certified by the affidavit of the person in custody thereof to be a true and complete record,"" delivered to the clerk of the court, and made available for examination by the parties, such documents ""shall be deemed to be sufficiently identified to be admissible in evidence if admissible in all other respects.""  Ibid.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 803(6)(B) (2016).', 'Similarly, G. L. c. 233, § 79G, as appearing in St. 1988, c. 130, provides for the admissibility of ""an itemized bill and reports, including hospital medical records, relating to medical, dental, hospital services, prescriptions, or orthopedic appliances rendered to or prescribed for a person injured, or any report of any examination of said injured person.""  Such records are admissible as evidence of the cost of medical treatment, of the necessity of treatment, or of the diagnosis, prognosis, or opinion of a ""physician or dentist"" as to the proximate cause of an injury or as to an injured party\'s disability or incapacity.  Ibid.  See Commonwealth v.

University Club,"", ', 75 (1951) (""The records which are admissible are those of hospitals of the class defined in § 70 which under that section they are required to keep.  The statute has no application to the records of other hospitals"").  On the other hand, ""[o]ur decisions have demonstrated liberal interpretation of the statute in the admission of hospital records.""  Commonwealth v.

Second, the records were not offered as hospital records under § 79,', 'Page 726', 'but rather as records of medical services under § 79G.', 'We conclude that the records produced by Cataldo were admissible as proffered, under § 79G.  While § 79G refers to the opinions of a ""physician"" or ""dentist,"" the statute defines those professions broadly to also include ""chiropodists, chiropractors, optometrists, osteopaths, physical therapists, podiatrists, psychologists and', '"" (emphasis supplied).  The professions listed in § 79G are all licensed under G. L. c. 112, whereas EMTs are certified under G. L. c. 111C, § 3(b)(3).  See 105 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 170.900 (2005) (certification and training requirements for EMTs).  Nonetheless, we see no distinction between the registration and licensing regimes of c. 112 and the certification requirements of c. 111C that would exclude EMTs from the category of other licensed medical personnel.  Compare Ortiz v. Examworks, Inc.,', ', 792 (2015) (term ""physicians"" in personal injury protection statute, G.

Irene, 462 Mass. at 614, quoting from 6 Wigmore, Evidence § 1707 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976).  These principles apply equally to EMTs.  The Cataldo records, prepared by licensed EMTs, were properly admitted under § 79G.', '', 'Moreover, even if the ambulance records had been offered and admitted as hospital records under § 79, any error would not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.

Bielski noticed newly installed steel doors at the home.  Although initially uncooperative, the defendant eventually agreed to disclose the location of the ""drugs.""  He led the police into a bedroom and indicated that the drugs were in a tote bag.  Inside the tote bag, Detective Haggerty discovered four plastic bags containing a substance that Bielski, based on his training and experience, believed to be cocaine.  These bags, which were weighed at the police station, had a combined weight well over 200 grams.  Detective Gracia found a fifth plastic bag containing a small amount of a substance that Bielski similarly identified as cocaine.  Also recovered during the search of the home was cash in the amount of $220 (ninety dollars of which was in nine rolls of ten one dollar bills), three pairs of binoculars, scales, packaging materials, cutting agents, a cellular telephone, and cocaine cooking materials, including metal strainers, a hot plate with a pot of water on it, and four glass tubes.  All of the cooking and packaging materials were set up in a storage room.  According to Bielski, the room dedicated to cooking and processing the cocaine in combination with the cocaine and cutting agents, both of which Bielski identified, indicated the defendant was engaged in cocaine distribution and sale, rather than personal use.  Bielski also stated that the binoculars were significant because they were counter-surveillance equipment.', 'The five plastic bags containing substances that Bielski identified as cocaine were sent to the Hinton Lab for analysis.  The lab issued four certificates; one certificate was issued for two of the bags.  Each certificate is signed by Della Saunders as the primary chemist and Dookhan as the confirmatory chemist and is dated September 8, 2010.

Relying on Ferrara v. United States, 456 F.3d 278, 290-297 (1st Cir. 2006), the Supreme Judicial Court articulated a two-prong test for analyzing a defendant's motion to withdraw a guilty plea in cases involving Dookhan's misconduct at the Hinton lab.  See Scott, 467 Mass. at 346-358.  See also Bridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist.,"", ', 467 n.6 (2015).', 'Page 815', ""Under the first prong, a defendant must show egregious misconduct by the government that preceded the entry of the defendant's guilty plea and where, as here, Dookhan signed the certificates as an assistant analyst before the defendant entered his plea, Scott provides that such misconduct is conclusively presumed."", 'Scott, supra at 347, 351-352.  See Commonwealth v. Ruffin,', ', 1004 (2016) (""Underlying [the conclusive presumption established in Scott] is the assumption that the misconduct evidenced by the certificate antedated the guilty plea"").', 'Under the second prong, the defendant ""must demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known of Dookhan\'s misconduct.""  Scott, supra at 355.  The defendant must ""particularize Dookhan\'s misconduct to his decision to tender a guilty plea.""  Id. at 354.  This is necessarily a fact-specific inquiry.', 'See id. at 356.', ""The thrust of the defendant's claim is that, had he known about Dookhan's misconduct, he would have insisted on going to trial because it is likely Dookhan's misconduct would have invalidated the lab's analysis of the substances and the Commonwealth, therefore, would not have been able to prove they were cocaine."", 'Specifically, he emphasizes that the confirmatory testing performed by Dookhan is a far more discriminating process than that used in the simple bench top tests conducted by the primary', 'Page 816', 'chemist, and because the confirmatory test was not performed, the primary test was not confirmed.', 'See Scott, supra at 340-341 (describing Hinton lab protocols for primary and confirmatory tests).', 'Relying on Commonwealth v. Gaston,', ', 574 (2014), the defendant argues that without the far more discriminating confirmatory test, the primary test could not be used by the Commonwealth to prove the substances were cocaine.  In Gaston, however, the question was whether there was a ""substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion"" had evidence of Dookhan\'s misconduct and her role as the confirmatory chemist been admitted at trial.  Id. at 573.  The court questioned, without deciding, whether the primary tests were sufficiently reliable to be admitted but reasoned that ""[i]f admitted, standing alone, [the tests\'] discriminatory weaknesses provide fodder for cross-examination.""  Id. at 574.  The Gaston court, in reviewing Dookhan\'s misconduct in the context of a trial, concluded that the misconduct would have been a real factor in the jury\'s deliberations, ibid., and granted the defendant a new trial.  See id. at 576.', ""Here, unlike in Gaston, the issue is whether the defendant would have pleaded guilty had he known of Dookhan's misconduct, not whether her misconduct was a real factor at a jury trial.  To address this question, the Commonwealth obtained a detailed affidavit from the primary chemist in this case, Saunders, regarding the analysis she performed."", 'Saunders stated that after making sure the evidence (the plastic bags containing the substances to be', 'Page 817', ""tested) matched the description on the evidence control cards, she signed it out of the evidence office.  She determined the net weight of the substance contained in each plastic bag.  Saunders then performed tests, including color and microcrystalline tests, on the substance in each plastic bag and documented that her findings were consistent with the presence of cocaine.  Next, Saunders took a small sample of the substance in each plastic bag and placed it in a glass vial, added a reagent, capped the vial, and submitted only the vials and the evidence control cards to the gas chromatogram/mass spectrometer section of the lab for confirmatory testing.  Saunders secured the plastic bags in her evidence locker, to which only she and her supervisor had a key.  After the confirmatory tests were completed, the evidence control cards were returned to Saunders; the cards contained Dookhan's initials and confirmatory findings of cocaine.  The evidence office generated certificates, which were signed by Saunders and Dookhan and notarized.  Saunders then returned the plastic bags to the evidence office."", ""There is little question that had the defendant been aware of Dookhan's misconduct when deciding to plead guilty, he would have concluded that the confirmatory and far more inculpatory testing could not be used against him, but that conclusion does not necessarily render the work of the primary chemist a nullity.  Saunders's affidavit makes clear that she performed at least two tests that indicated the substances were consistent with cocaine and that her role in testing and storing the substances was entirely independent of the testing done by Dookhan.  While there may have been some uncertainty whether the results of primary testing would be admissible at trial, see Gaston, 86 Mass. App. Ct. at 574, in deciding whether to plead guilty the defendant had to consider the likelihood that at least some aspect of that testing would be admissible, in the same way that field tests may be admitted.  See Commonwealth v. Marte,"", ', 140-144 (2013) (field testing admitted; and in combination with', 'Page 818', 'circumstantial evidence sufficient to prove identity of substance).', 'Moreover, as found by the motion judge, there was significant additional evidence that suggested the substances at issue were cocaine.  See Commonwealth v. Dawson,', ', 467 (1987) (""Proof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis and may be made by circumstantial evidence"").  The police had conducted two controlled purchases from the defendant and both substances purchased field tested positive for cocaine; a room in the defendant\'s home had all the requisite supplies, tools, and instruments specific to cooking, processing, and packaging cocaine for distribution; the defendant pointed out the ""drugs"" to the police; and an experienced detective, based on his training and experience, was potentially available to testify.', ""While there is no guarantee that the detective who identified the drugs as cocaine before the grand jury would have been able to testify to that opinion at trial, the defendant, in deciding whether to plead guilty, had to consider the possibility that the detective would be qualified to testify that the substances were consistent with cocaine.  The detective's testimony that the substances' appearance was consistent with cocaine would have been inculpatory.  And to the extent the defendant claims that the controlled purchases and the materials found in his apartment evidence merely distribution rather than the composition of the substances, he overlooks proof that the controlled purchases involved only cocaine, his apartment was specifically set up for cooking and processing cocaine, and the only drugs found in the apartment were identified by the police as consistent with cocaine.  The nature of the distribution enterprise lends circumstantial force to the inference that the substance was cocaine.  In sum, there was significant evidence, apart from the confirmatory test by Dookhan, that the Commonwealth may have been able to use to prove that the substances were cocaine."", ""In addition, as the motion judge found, the plea agreement significantly reduced the defendant's sentence.  See Scott, 467 Mass. at 357 (noting that when assessing second prong of Ferrara-Scott test, judge may consider sentence reduction resulting from plea).  The agreement enabled the defendant, who was fifty-seven years old at the time of the plea hearing, to avoid a minimum mandatory twenty-two year sentence and receive a ten to twelve year"", 'Page 819', 'sentence.', 'In these circumstances, the value of the evidence of Dookhan\'s misconduct was outweighed by the benefits of entering into a favorable plea agreement that eliminated potentially ten additional years in prison in a case in which the defendant was confronted with a variety of evidence, apart from the confirmatory test conducted by Dookhan, that the Commonwealth may have been able to use to prove the substances were cocaine.  Contrary to the affidavits submitted by the defendant and his attorney, the motion judge did not err in concluding that ""[n]o reasonable person in [the defendant\'s] position would have rejected the Commonwealth\'s deal.""', ""3.  Exculpatory and newly discovered evidence claims.  The defendant also contends that the motion to vacate his guilty plea should have been allowed on the basis that the Commonwealth failed to provide exculpatory evidence (prosecutorial nondisclosure claim) concerning Dookhan's misconduct, as required by Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(1)(A), as amended,  444 Mass. 1501  (2005), and the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and that Dookhan's misconduct constitutes newly discovered evidence."", '', ""Knowledge of Dookhan's misconduct evolved over a number of months as the investigation progressed.  The defendant complains that the Commonwealth did not disclose letters sent by Dr. Linda Han, the director of the Bureau of Laboratory Sciences, to the Norfolk and Suffolk County"", 'district attorney\'s offices and ultimately all district attorneys for all counties.  The first letter was dated February 1, 2012, and addressed to the Norfolk district attorney, informing him of a ""possible breach of protocol with respect to ninety drug samples"" tested at the lab and that were', 'Page 820', 'exclusively from Norfolk County.', 'The second letter, dated February 21, 2012, outlined a breach of protocol related to the ninety samples from Norfolk County and described the failure of a chemist to properly log the transfer of the samples that she removed from the evidence office for testing.', 'The letter further indicated that, although the chemist responsible for these mistakes was an otherwise exemplary employee, she had been removed from all responsibilities involving laboratory analysis.  The letter also indicated that an investigation found ""there was no evidence to suggest that the integrity of the results was impacted by the documentation issue with the log book.""  The letter did not name the chemist involved.', 'The defendant also has identified a third letter, dated April 20, 2012, just five days before his plea, from Dr. Han to the Suffolk County district attorney about the investigation into the handling of the Norfolk County evidence.  The defendant argues that it is reasonable to conclude that all of the district attorneys\' offices received a similar letter and the magistrate assumed they received the letters.  No information in these three letters suggests tests conducted on any evidence submitted from Bristol County were involved in the breach of protocol, and the April 20 letter affirmatively states only Norfolk County evidence was ""involved.""', ""Finally, the defendant cites to evidence of a fourth letter sent from a defense attorney to the Bristol County district attorney's office two weeks prior to the defendant's plea.  That letter of April 11, 2012, identifies Dookhan as the chemist involved in misconduct at the lab and indicates that despite Dookhan's suspension from her duties, she had testified as an expert chemist in a Bristol County criminal prosecution without disclosing her suspension."", '', 'Page 821', ""Even if we assume that the letters were disseminated to all the district attorneys before the date of the defendant's guilty plea on April 25, 2012, and that they might have some exculpatory benefit, the defendant fares no better, whether the letters are viewed as exculpatory or newly discovered evidence."", ""In Scott, the Supreme Judicial Court discussed at length the similarity among the standards used to assess prejudice to the defendant under the second prong of the Ferrara test (see discussion, supra), the test for prosecutorial nondisclosure under Federal case law, and our formulation of the test for cases in which a defendant claims that counsel's ineffective assistance induced the defendant to plead guilty.

They lived with their young child in a second-floor apartment on State Street in Springfield.

Days later, after hearing gunfire in the apartment building, she called 911 and spoke with the Springfield police officers who responded to her apartment.', '""[C]oncerned for the well-being of her child and herself if they continued to live with the defendant in that apartment,"" Stewart went to the Springfield police department ""to disclose that her husband, the defendant, was involved in drug dealing and possessed a firearm.""  After speaking with a Springfield police sergeant, she was introduced to another Springfield officer, Ronald Sheehan, a twenty-five year veteran who was also a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) joint counterterrorism task force (task force), a joint effort of Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel.  Stewart told Sheehan that the defendant\'s supplier was a white male with tattoos on his hand who drove a white Jeep Cherokee.  She showed Sheehan a photograph of the defendant\'s handgun.  Sheehan learned that the defendant had prior convictions for drug trafficking and unlawful possession', 'Page 167', ""of a firearm, disqualifying him from lawfully possessing a gun in Massachusetts.  Stewart and Sheehan had a number of in-person and telephone contacts over the next two to three weeks leading up to the defendant's arrest."", 'One evening in December, 2011, Stewart called Sheehan to tell him that the defendant was about to meet his supplier at the gasoline station next door to the apartment building.

Berrios and Sowers saw a white Jeep Cherokee in the gasoline station parking lot and parked their marked cruiser behind it.', '', 'Sheehan then received a second call from Stewart.  She told him that the defendant had just left the apartment, was wearing a red vest, and had his gun with him.  Sheehan observed the defendant leave the building, wearing a red vest or jacket, and walk toward the gasoline station.  He warned Berrios and Sowers that the defendant was approaching and was armed.  Berrios and Sowers seized the defendant, each grabbing an arm, and Sowers conducted a patfrisk.  Finding nothing, he handcuffed the defendant and placed him in the back of the cruiser.', ""Stewart, who observed the patfrisk from the window of her apartment and did not see the officers remove the gun, called Sheehan again and informed him that the defendant had placed the gun in his underwear.

The officers returned the defendant to the cruiser, unzipped his pants, and removed the gun."", 'b.  Discussion.  The defendant challenges his seizure and search on two grounds.  First, he contends that Stewart\'s tip was unreliable.  We disagree.  This case does not involve an unidentified informant -- Stewart was known to the police as the defendant\'s wife.

Consequently, pursuant to the ACCA, he was sentenced to a consolidated mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less than fifteen years and not more than fifteen years and one day.  On appeal, the defendant claims (1) his motion to suppress the firearm and the ammunition should have been allowed, (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions, and (3) the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had three prior qualifying convictions under the ACCA.  The motion to suppress properly was denied, and we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the underlying convictions.  However, we vacate the sentence imposed pursuant to the ACCA and remand for resentencing for the reasons that follow.', 'Background.  1.  Motion to suppress.  In the fall of 2010, members of a law enforcement task force identified the defendant as a suspect in a series of commercial property burglaries in Plymouth and Bristol Counties.  The police learned, through a confidential informant and recorded conversations between the informant and the defendant, that the defendant was in Florida purchasing guns and drugs for transport to Massachusetts.  As of February 2, 2011,', 'Page 698', ""the police knew that the defendant was returning to Massachusetts driving a gray Jeep Commander sport utility vehicle and that he would likely be with his girl friend, Brianna Tobin.  Within twenty-four hours of receiving the information, the police observed the defendant on Route 3A in Kingston, Massachusetts, in a gray Jeep Commander, with a woman matching Tobin's description.  Police were also aware that the defendant had a criminal history including crimes of violence, that he was not licensed to drive in Massachusetts, that there were three outstanding warrants for his arrest, and that neither he nor Tobin were licensed to carry a firearm in Massachusetts.  Police observed the defendant pull into a gasoline station.  They approached the defendant as he returned to his vehicle, and identified themselves.  The defendant immediately fled on foot.  He was apprehended shortly thereafter, unarmed."", 'Once the defendant was apprehended, another officer approached Tobin who was still seated in the passenger seat of the gray Jeep Commander.  The officer, with his gun drawn and police identification visible, repeatedly screamed, ""Police"" and ordered Tobin to place her hands where the officer could see them.  When Tobin failed to do so, and continued to move within the vehicle, the officer opened the door and removed her from the vehicle.  As soon as the officer placed his hands on Tobin, he observed a firearm in plain view on the floor of the front passenger\'s side.  The vehicle was secured and police applied for a warrant to search the vehicle.  The warrant was authorized and the subsequent search of the vehicle resulted in the seizure of the firearm and ammunition.', '2.  Additional trial evidence.  The defendant and Tobin were charged, inter alia, with possession of the firearm seized from the vehicle.  Tobin agreed to cooperate with the Commonwealth and testified against the defendant at trial.  Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, the charges against her were dismissed.  She testified that the firearm belonged to the defendant and that he left it with her in the vehicle for fear that someone would see it if he took it into the gasoline station with him.', 'Another witness, Adam Long, testified at trial and identified the firearm as one that he sold to the defendant in Daytona, Florida, in late 2010.  Long testified that at the time of the sale, the defendant was accompanied by his girl friend.', ""Discussion.  1.  Motion to suppress.  The motion judge, who was not the trial judge, denied the defendant's motion to suppress the"", 'Page 699', ""firearm and the ammunition after an evidentiary hearing.  He concluded that the exit order and the arrest of Tobin were lawful in the circumstances.  On appeal, the defendant's principal claim is that the exit order that led to the seizure of the firearm was not justified by safety concerns.  We disagree."", '""On review of a motion to suppress, we do not disturb the judge\'s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.""  Commonwealth v. Sicari,', ', 746 (2001).  We ""give[] substantial deference to the judge\'s ultimate findings and conclusions of law,"" Commonwealth v. Morse,', ', 122 (1998), quoting from Commonwealth v. Magee,', ', 384 (1996), and ""leave to the judge the responsibility of determining the weight and credibility to be given oral testimony presented at the motion hearing.""  Commonwealth v.

Commonwealth v. Hoose,', ', 400 (2014).', 'There are three bases upon which an exit order issued to a passenger in a vehicle may be justified:  (i) an objectively reasonable concern for the safety of the officer or other persons, (ii) reasonable suspicion that the passenger is engaged in criminal activity, or (iii) pragmatic reasons, e.g., to facilitate an otherwise lawful search of the vehicle pursuant to the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  Commonwealth v. Cruz,', ', 466-467 (2011).  ""[I]t does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order or search based on safety concerns.""  Commonwealth v. Gonsalves,', ', 664 (1999).  The test is an objective one, taking into consideration the totality of circumstances.  Id. at 665.', 'Here, based on a multiagency and multijurisdictional investigation, the police had information that the defendant was transporting drugs and firearms from Florida to Massachusetts.  Police were also aware that the defendant would be accompanied by Tobin, his girl friend, whom the informant ""had identified . . . as accompanying [the defendant] down south on these trips to purchase guns and Percocets.""  Thus, the officer who approached Tobin had reason to believe that (1) the passenger in the vehicle was the defendant\'s girl friend, (2) she had witnessed the defendant\'s flight and arrest, and (3) there were firearms in the vehicle.  In these circumstances, we discern no error in the motion judge\'s conclusion that the passenger ""reasonably could be viewed by the', 'Page 700', 'police as a confederate of [the defendant], . . . prepared to assist him in a variety of different ways, including the violent upset of his arrest.""', 'We are not persuaded by the defendant\'s claim that the force used in seizing Tobin was ""disproportionate.""

Sinforoso,', ', 323 (2001), quoting from Commonwealth v. Williams,', "", 116 (1996).  Because Tobin refused to show her hands when ordered to do so, and continued to move within the vehicle, the officer's heightened concerns for his safety were entirely reasonable.  See Commonwealth v. Obiora,"", "", 59 (2013).  We conclude that the exit order that revealed the firearm in plain view was justified based upon the officer's objectively reasonable concern for his safety, and therefore we discern no error in the denial of the motion to suppress."", '2.  Sufficiency.  The defendant argues that the uncorroborated testimony from ""immunized"" witnesses Tobin and Long was insufficient to prove the defendant\'s possession of the firearm and the ammunition.  The defendant relies on G. L. c. 233, § 20I, inserted by St. 1970, c. 408, which provides that ""[n]o defendant in any criminal proceeding shall be convicted solely on the testimony of, or the evidence produced by, a person granted immunity under the provisions of section twenty E.""  His reliance on this statute is misplaced.', 'First, ""[t]here is no requirement that a cooperating witness\'s testimony be corroborated unless the witness is immunized under G. L. c. 233, § 20E.""  Commonwealth v. Lessieur,', ', 330 (2015).  Nothing in the record indicates that either Tobin or Long received immunity pursuant to § 20E.  Tobin testified pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the Commonwealth in exchange for dismissal of the charges against her.  According to Long, he was granted immunity from Federal charges in the Middle District of Florida in exchange for his testimony.  Thus, although both Tobin and Long testified in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecuting authorities, neither was immunized pursuant to § 20E.  Nevertheless, the trial judge instructed the jurors that the witnesses were immunized and that their testimony', 'Page 701', 'should be treated with caution.', '', 'Second, even if Tobin and Long qualified as immunized witnesses under § 20E, their testimony was sufficiently corroborated.  See Commonwealth v. Vacher,', ', 440 (2014) (corroboration for immunized witnesses required on only one element of proof essential to conviction).  Police officers testified regarding the position of the firearm in the vehicle, the operability of the firearm, that the firearm was loaded, and that it could accept a detachable magazine holding twelve rounds.  Thus, there was ample corroboration from nonimmunized witnesses on the essential elements of the offenses.  Simply put, when considered as a whole and in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see Commonwealth v. Latimore,', ', 677 (1979), the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the charged offenses.', '3.  Sentencing under the ACCA.  At the jury-waived trial on the sentencing enhancement charges, the Commonwealth introduced certified copies of four prior convictions:  assault and battery committed on July 19, 2001 (guilty plea on December 6, 2001); assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (ABDW) committed on March 18, 2004 (guilty plea on February 9, 2005); possession with intent to distribute a class B controlled substance committed on January 8, 2008 (guilty plea on October 20, 2008); and assault by means of a dangerous weapon committed on January 11, 2008 (guilty plea on October 20, 2008).  Witnesses identified the defendant as the person previously convicted in each case.  On the underlying convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition, the trial judge found the defendant guilty of the subsequent offender portion of the indictments which alleged that the defendant had ""been previously convicted of three violent crimes or three serious drug offenses, or any combination thereof totaling three, arising from separate incidences"" and imposed the mandatory minimum enhanced sentence of fifteen years.  G. L. c. 269, § 10G(c), inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, § 71.', 'The defendant challenges his convictions and his sentence as an armed career criminal for two reasons.  First, he claims that ABDW is not a violent crime within the meaning of the ACCA.', 'Page 702', 'Second, he claims that the 2008 convictions of (1) assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and (2) possession with intent to distribute a class B controlled substance, should be treated as a single offense under the ACCA because the underlying conduct was close in time and the charges were resolved by guilty pleas in a single proceeding.  We address these arguments in turn.', 'a.  ABDW as a violent crime.  Under the ACCA, a ""violent crime"" is:', '""any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that:  (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is burglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of explosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.""', 'G. L. c. 140, § 121, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 180, § 8.  See G. L. c. 269, § 10G(e).  The Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that the fourth clause of the definition of violent crime, the so-called ""residual"" clause, is unconstitutionally vague.  Commonwealth v. Beal,', ', 351 (2016).  Accordingly, in the circumstances here, the only potentially applicable section of the definition is the first clause, the so-called ""force"" clause.', 'To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the ACCA, judges usually apply a ""categorical approach.""  Commonwealth v. Eberhart,', ', 815 (2012), quoting from Commonwealth v. Colon,', ', 15 (2011).  Under this approach, the judge looks ""only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.""  Ibid., quoting from Colon, supra.  However, if the prior conviction was under a broad statute encompassing multiple crimes, not all of which are violent, a judge should apply a ""modified categorical approach,"" which permits consideration of extrinsic evidence.  Id. at 816, quoting from Colon, supra at 16.', 'The defendant argues that the modified categorical approach should apply in this case because ABDW encompasses both intentional and reckless conduct.  Relying on Federal authority, the defendant contends that reckless ABDW does not qualify as a violent crime under the ACCA.  See United States v. Parnell, 818 F.3d 974, 981 n.5 (9th Cir. 2016).  No Massachusetts court has gone that far.', 'Page 703', 'In analyzing reckless conduct within the crime of simple assault and battery, the Supreme Judicial Court has said that reckless battery has an element of physical force and is sufficient to qualify as a violent crime within the meaning of the ACCA.  Eberhart, supra at 818-819.', 'We see no reason to reach a different result with the more serious crime of ABDW.  Indeed, we have previously observed that ""[i]t is undisputed that, if committed by an adult, an assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon would be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and thus would constitute a violent crime under the Massachusetts ACCA.""  Commonwealth v. Rezendes,', "", 372 (2015).  Accordingly, the defendant's conviction of ABDW qualifies as a violent crime under the force clause and the trial judge was not required to apply the modified categorical approach."", 'b.  Separate incidences.  General Laws c. 269, § 10G(c), inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, § 71, provides in relevant part:', '""Whoever, having been previously convicted of three violent crimes or three serious drug offenses, or any combination thereof totaling three,', '. . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than 15 years nor more than 20 years"" (emphasis supplied).', 'In a case decided after the sentence here was imposed, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that sentencing enhancement under the ACCA ""applies only when a defendant\'s previous convictions of three qualifying crimes \'arising from separate incidences\' were the results of separate, sequential prosecutions.""  Commonwealth v. Resende,', ', 469 (2016).  In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned that sequential prosecutions occur when ""the first conviction (and imposition of sentence) occur before the commission of the second predicate crime, and the second conviction and sentence occur before the commission of the third crime.""  Id. at 466-467.', 'Here, although the 2008 convictions of (1) assault by means of', 'Page 704', 'a dangerous weapon, and (2) possession with intent to distribute a class B controlled substance were for conduct alleged to have occurred on different dates and charged in separate complaints, they resulted from guilty pleas and sentences imposed at a single hearing.  The defendant pleaded guilty and received committed jail sentences to both charges, concurrent with each other, on October 20, 2008.  Accordingly, under the reasoning of Resende they were not sequential prosecutions and, therefore, did not arise from separate incidences.  We therefore conclude, as required by Resende, that these two prior convictions must be considered as one for ACCA purposes.', 'Following the jury-waived trial on the ACCA allegations, the trial judge found the defendant guilty of the subsequent offender portion of the indictments without reference to the prior convictions upon which she relied.  We can reasonably infer from her findings of guilty and the resulting mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years that she found at least three prior qualifying convictions, but we cannot discern from the record which three she found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Based on our conclusion that the two 2008 convictions cannot be considered separate, sequential convictions under the ACCA, we remand the case for resentencing so that the trial judge can determine whether, in light of our ruling, the defendant has two or three prior qualifying convictions under the ACCA.', '', 'Conclusion.  For the foregoing reasons, the underlying convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, unlawful possession of a large capacity feeding device, and unlawful possession of a loaded firearm are affirmed.  The finding that the defendant was guilty as an armed career criminal pursuant to G. L. c. 269, § 10G(c), and the consolidated', 'Page 705', 'sentence based on three predicate offenses, are vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.', 'So ordered.']"

To demonstrate the existence of this state of affairs, the defendant must establish that at least one of the following three conditions existed at the time of his change of plea:  ""(1) [that] he had an \'available, substantial ground of defence,\' Saferian, [366 Mass.] at 96, that would have been pursued if he had been correctly advised of the dire immigration consequences attendant to accepting the plea bargain; (2) there is a reasonable probability that a different plea bargain (absent such consequences) could have been negotiated at that time; or (3) the presence of \'special circumstances\' that support the conclusion that he placed, or would have placed, particular emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding whether to plead guilty"" (footnote omitted).  Clarke, supra at 47-48, quoting Hill, supra at 60.  See Henry, 88 Mass. App. Ct. at 455.', 'i.  Substantial ground of defense.  The defendant contends that his plea counsel failed to investigate two lines of defense, neither of which we conclude meets the test of substantiality under the first prong of the prejudice analysis.  First, the defendant argues', 'Page 724', ""that the failure to investigate the confidential informant's identity constitutes ineffective assistance.  This argument lacks merit as the defendant sold the narcotics to an undercover officer, not the confidential informant, and other officers witnessed the transactions.  See Commonwealth v. Connolly,"", ', 828 (2009) (rejecting defendant\'s request to identify confidential informant when ""[t]he informant was not a percipient witness to the charged crimes"" after undercover officer made controlled purchases).', 'Second, the defendant contends that plea counsel was ineffective because he failed to contest the drug test results for the recovered narcotics in the wake of the scandal at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute (Hinton lab).  See Commonwealth v. Scott,', ', 337-338 (2014) (outlining timeline of Hinton lab scandal).  This argument is also without merit because it is based on speculation that there was tampering or impropriety with the tested narcotics.  Furthermore, the narcotics recovered from the defendant were tested neither at the Hinton lab nor at the time Annie Dookhan was acting as a chemist there.  See Commonwealth v. Duran,', ', 103 (2001) (""Speculation, without more, is not a sufficient basis to establish ineffective representation""); Commonwealth v. Ferreira,', ', 116-117 (2006).', ""ii.  More favorable plea agreement.  The defendant also argues that his plea counsel's representation met the second Saferian prong of prejudice because plea counsel failed to advocate for a different plea agreement that did not carry the same immigration consequences.  The defendant has failed to demonstrate, beyond a speculative claim, that counsel had any reasonable prospect of achieving an agreement with the Commonwealth that would have resulted in a sentence that would have avoided deportation consequences.  See Commonwealth v. Chleikh,"", ', 727 (2012) (Chleikh).  Cf. Commonwealth v. Martinez,', "", 600 (2012) (Martinez) (concluding that defendant's affidavits supported finding that it was reasonably probable to negotiate different plea agreement); Commonwealth v. Gordon,"", "", 400-01 (2012).  Furthermore, the motion judge credited the Commonwealth's statements that there would have been no changes to the plea agreement offered."", '', 'Page 725', ""iii.  Special circumstances.  The defendant's final argument relies on the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Lavrinenko,"", '(2015).  The defendant\'s supplemental affidavit in support of his motion for a new trial was filed in 2015.  In it, the defendant identifies the following considerations that he contends qualify as ""special circumstances"":  (1) a recent diagnosis of mental health problems, (2) limited Creole and French language skills, (3) a history of abuse as a child by his father, and (4) the fact that his only immediate family (mother and brother) died in the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010.  The defendant did not submit any further affidavits or documentation of the factual statements set forth in his affidavit.  The court did not find that any of these circumstances rose to the level of special circumstances, or were substantial enough to warrant an evidentiary hearing.  Clearly, the defendant\'s recent mental health diagnosis was not a circumstance in existence at the time of his guilty plea and thus cannot be considered a special circumstance.  Compare Commonwealth v. Sylvain,', "", 836-837 (Sylvain II).  While it would have been preferable for the judge to explain whether his reasoning was based either on a decision not to credit the remainder of the defendant's factual statements,"", 'or because, even if true, they were not sufficiently ""special"" to meet the defendant\'s burden of proof, we discern no abuse of his discretion or error of law.', 'In other cases in which ""special circumstances"" were found to exist, the court identified specific connections between the defendant and family members residing here in the United States, specific connections between the defendant and his local community, or a specific condition that the defendant suffered from at the time of his plea that would make his return to his native country extremely difficult.  See DeJesus, 468 Mass. at 183-184 (special circumstances existed where defendant demonstrated strong family and employment ties in Boston); Lavrinenko, 473 Mass. at 60-61 (refugee status is ""special"" circumstance such that not considering it when determining whether prejudice occurred', 'Page 726', 'is error); Cano, 87 Mass.

Contrast Chleikh, 82 Mass. App. Ct. at 728 (no special circumstances found where defendant\'s affidavit stated only that he had moved to United States eight years prior, and made no reference to any family or community ties).  Apart from his statement that he has a ""community of friends"" in the United States and ""desire[s] to make a life"" here, the defendant has not identified any employment history, family relationships or other personal circumstances that existed at the time of his plea that would have explained why he would choose to go to trial despite the strong case prepared by the Commonwealth.', 'Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.']"

He then stated, ""The most important issue that we need to clarify is the relationship between you and I.  From the first meeting on, our attraction', 'Page 218', 'to each other was well defined indeed.  You can\'t hide something like that and we need to address it immediately.""

The defendant responded that he had not done anything illegal, then paused and stated, ""As of yet.""  After another pause, he stated, ""I don\'t plan on it.""  Caren\'s mother ""panicked"" and applied for and obtained a harassment prevention order for herself and Caren against the defendant.', 'Thereafter, the defendant began sending letters to Caren.', 'In the first letter, the defendant asked for ""another chance,"" writing, ""I will care for you, suck your toes and everything else until death do us part.

In another letter the defendant shared details about his convictions for attempted murder and for being a felon in possession of a firearm, spoke of a ""sexually explicit"" letter he had sent to a woman whom he referred to as his ""French-American CIA soulmate,"" and stated that he once had visions of that woman being ""trapped and beaten and stabbed in the vagina.""

Motion to suppress.  While the defendant was in pretrial detention at the Hampden County house of correction (HCHC), the Springfield police department notified HCHC officials that he was sending letters to Caren in violation of the harassment prevention order that was then in place.  HCHC\'s written policies, a copy of which was provided to the defendant, authorized the inspection of inmates\' outgoing nonprivileged correspondence when ""such action is necessary to maintain security or order in the facility or protect the physical safety of an individual.""  The policies also authorized disapproval of outgoing correspondence ""the contents of which fall as a whole or in significant part"" into certain categories, including ""[c]riminal activity or plans for criminal activity.""  Pursuant to these policies, prison officials began inspecting the defendant\'s outgoing nonprivileged mail and confiscated any letters directed to or regarding Caren.', 'The defendant moved to suppress evidence of the confiscated letters, claiming a violation of his First Amendment rights.  The judge denied the motion, concluding that prison officials properly monitored the defendant\'s mail based on ""specific information that the defendant was violating an active antiharassment order"" and to ""investigat[e] if the defendant was engaging in such criminal activity and [to] prevent[] the defendant from committing such conduct.""  On appeal the defendant challenges the judge\'s ruling with respect to only one letter, which he addressed to a flower shop, requesting that flowers, gifts, and a card be sent', 'Page 220', 'to Caren.', 'In reviewing this challenge, ""we accept the judge\'s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error but \'conduct an independent review of h[er] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\'""  Commonwealth v.

Instead, he challenges the policies as applied, claiming that his letter could not be seized without a warrant because it did not threaten the security of the facility or the physical safety of any person.  We disagree.  Inspecting the defendant\'s mail to prevent him from violating an active harassment prevention order was reasonably related to the legitimate penological interests of maintaining order and preventing commission of a crime.  See Van den Bosch v. Raemisch, 658 F.3d 778, 785 (7th Cir. 2011), quoting from Turner, 482 U.S. at 89 (""Prison officials may . . . impose restrictions on prisoner correspondence if those restrictions are \'reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,\'"" including ""crime deterrence"").

It was"", 'Page 221', ""reasonable to presume that the defendant might try to contact Caren through third parties, especially given that HCHC's assistant superintendent expressly warned the defendant to stop communicating with Caren and her mother.  The motion to suppress the letter to the flower shop was therefore properly denied."", '2.  Jury instruction.  The crimes of criminal harassment and stalking both require proof that the defendant engaged in ""malicious"" conduct.', 'Relying on the model jury instruction, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:  ""An act is done maliciously if it\'s done intentionally and without justification or mitigation, and any reasonably prudent person would have foreseen the actual harm that resulted.""  See Instructions 6.640 and 6.680 of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2011).  The defendant argues that, under Commonwealth v. McDonald,', "", 242 (2012), the judge should have instead instructed that whether an act is malicious depends on the defendant's subjective state of mind and requires proof of specific intent to harm the victim.  Because the defendant preserved this issue for appeal, we review for prejudicial error.  See Commonwealth v. Allen,"", ', 168 (2016).', ""We discern no error in the judge's instruction.  In Commonwealth v. Paton,"", ', 219 (2005), we specifically rejected the argument that a defendant must have ""act[ed] out of \'cruelty, hostility, or revenge\'"" to be guilty of criminal harassment.  Instead, concluding that ""[w]e need not be confined to only those particular states of mind,"" we defined a malicious act to include an ""intentional, wrongful act performed against another without legal justification or excuse.""  Ibid., quoting from Black\'s Law Dictionary 977 (8th ed. 2004).', ""Likewise, in Commonwealth v. O'Neil,"", ', 293 (2006), we concluded that ""the statute\'s requirement of malice"" is satisfied where the defendant\'s ""conduct was intentional and without justification or mitigation, and any reasonably prudent person would have foreseen the actual harm that', 'Page 222', 'resulted.""  As in Paton, we rejected an invitation to define malice to ""include the element of hatred, spite, grudge, or ill will,"" holding that criminal harassment does not require proof of specific intent.  Id. at 291-292.  ""The malice required,"" we reiterated, ""is not a feeling of ill-will toward the person threatened, but the wilful doing of the act with the illegal intent.""  Id. at 292, quoting from Commonwealth v. Buckley, 148 Mass. 27 , 28 (1888).', 'The defendant does not dispute that the judge\'s instruction comported with Paton and O\'Neil but claims that McDonald changed existing law.  In support, he relies on the following quotation from a parenthetical in McDonald:  ""malicious acts are \'done with an evil disposition, a wrong and unlawful motive or purpose; the wilful doing of an injurious act without lawful excuse.\'""  462 Mass. at 242, quoting from Paton, 63 Mass. App. Ct. at 219.  But this parenthetical quotation does not have the import that the defendant gives it.  The defendant disregards the latter part of the quotation -- defining a malicious act as ""the wilful doing of an injurious act without lawful excuse"" -- which, as he acknowledged at oral argument, conveys essentially the same message as the judge\'s instruction.  Furthermore, McDonald takes the quotation from Paton, which, again, rejected a definition of malice that would require proof of specific intent.  McDonald also cites O\'Neil with approval in the same paragraph.  See ibid.', ""In short, we see nothing in McDonald that overrules or calls into doubt our decisions in Paton and O'Neil.  As the judge's instruction was consistent with Paton and O'Neil, there was no error."", '3.  Sufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant\'s sufficiency challenge is limited to the element of malice.  We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether ""any rational trier of fact could have found [that] . . . element[] of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Latimore, 378 Mass. at 677.', 'The defendant mainly argues that there was no evidence that he harbored ill will towards the victims.  As discussed above, however, ill will is not required to prove stalking or criminal harassment.  Although the defendant also claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove malice under the instruction as given, he provides no reasoning in support, other than conclusory assertions that his actions were ""innocuous"" and not ""malicious.""', 'In any event, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to find that the defendant acted maliciously.  With', 'Page 223', 'respect to Miranda, after meeting her once in a professional setting, the defendant persisted in contacting her, located her home phone number and address, and then sent her a letter claiming to be her ""CIA boyfriend"" and discussing an imaginary romantic relationship between them.  With respect to sixteen year old Caren, the defendant committed numerous acts that the jury could have found to be malicious, including sending her letters in which he addressed her as his romantic and sexual partner, gave details about his criminal history, suggested leaving the country together, and described violent fantasies of a woman being beaten and stabbed.  The defendant\'s conduct was intentional and without justification or mitigation, and we are satisfied that a reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that both victims would have been harmed by his behavior.  See O\'Neil, 67 Mass. App. Ct. at 293.  Thus, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\'s convictions for stalking and criminal harassment.  See Paton, 63 Mass. App. Ct. at 220 (""defendant\'s staring at the victim in the bar without speaking and then unexpectedly appearing in proximity to her in other places had an ominous, menacing, even sinister quality"" and ""constitute[d] legally malicious conduct""); O\'Neil, 67 Mass.

Background.', 'On April 4, 2015, Quincy police Detective Dennis Keenan was patrolling the ""South Quincy/Penn Hill"" area', 'Page 234', ""of Quincy in plain clothes and in an unmarked cruiser.  Detective Keenan, a seven-year drug control unit veteran who had been involved in more than one thousand drug cases, had made arrests in that area.  Around 5:45 p.m., Keenan witnessed Tyler Mauritson exit a blue Infiniti motor vehicle, registered to a Brockton woman, that was parked in front of 35 Nicholl Street, which is Mauritson's home.  Keenan, who was familiar with Mauritson, watched as Mauritson entered his residence."", 'The Infiniti drove away and turned left onto Franklin Street, traveling into Braintree.  The detective followed the car as it went left onto Hayward Street and then right onto Quincy Avenue, traveling south.  While Keenan followed the Infiniti, he contacted Detective Michael Duran and requested that he speak to Mauritson and provide Keenan with an update.', 'The Infiniti turned onto the Arborway, which is a residential way that ends at the Fore River with side streets that lead back to Quincy Avenue.  Once the vehicle was on the Arborway, it began to slow down before it turned into a driveway located ten to fifteen houses down the street.  The car then backed up, turned around, and traveled back on the same route it had just driven.  While this was occurring, Keenan ""tucked"" his unmarked cruiser onto a side street to remain undetected.  Keenan was aware of counter surveillance methods by which a suspect, who is being surveilled for illegal narcotics activity, employs certain driving tactics to determine if the police are following him.  Such tactics include the suspect pulling the car over and watching how many cars go by and in which direction they proceed, or driving around a rotary without exiting to monitor any cars that similarly follow.', 'As the Infiniti passed by Keenan, he noticed that the front passenger window was open and that there was both an operator and a front seat passenger.  The detective could not see if there were back seat passengers because the windows were tinted and closed.  The car continued back up the Arborway, back onto Quincy Avenue, then back onto Hayward Street on the same route it had just followed.  The vehicle did not go back to Franklin Street; instead, it continued toward Elm Street, which leads toward a highway on-ramp.  Keenan found it significant that the Infiniti had stopped, reversed direction, and then continued toward the same place from where it had started.', 'After Detective Duran provided Keenan with an update on his conversation with Mauritson, Keenan contacted the Braintree police to request assistance in stopping the Infiniti.  When a', 'Page 235', 'Braintree police officer pulled his car behind the Infiniti and activated its siren, the Infiniti did not stop immediately, but turned right and traveled ""a very short distance and stopped.""  When the car stopped, Keenan approached the passenger\'s side, while the Braintree police officer approached the driver.  The driver was identified as Kevin Cardoza, and the front seat passenger was identified as the juvenile.  Through the open back passenger\'s side window, Keenan saw Louis Andrade, the back seat passenger, take his right hand and place it on the floor.  Keenan considered this movement ""suspicious"" and ""significant,"" and he feared that Andrade might be retrieving a weapon.  Keenan grabbed Andrade\'s hand and pinned it to the floor, then raised it up and told Andrade to keep his hands in the air.', 'Andrade was removed from the back seat of the Infiniti.  As he was removed, Keenan saw a small bag on the seat where Andrade had been sitting.  That bag contained seven individually packaged bags of cocaine.  The other occupants were also removed from the vehicle.', 'After Andrade had been handcuffed, Detective Keenan went back to the area of the car where Andrade had put his hand on the floor and Keenan ""could see right in front of [him] . . . a larger plastic bag"" that contained twenty-three individually packaged bags of cocaine and that weighed forty-four grams.  Keenan thought Andrade\'s earlier hand movement to the car\'s floor was consistent with Andrade removing the cocaine from his person and putting it on the floor.  Other than the front seat itself, no barrier separated the juvenile from the back seat area where the larger bag of cocaine was discovered.', 'From the car\'s occupants, the police also seized three knives, one from each suspect; seven cellular telephones (cell phones); and approximately $2,000, divided among the three occupants.  The money was separated into ""different folds"" and denominations.  Cardoza possessed the majority of the money, the juvenile had $294, and sixty-five dollars were either in Andrade\'s possession or in the glove compartment.', 'No narcotics were found on the juvenile\'s person or in the front seat area where he had been sitting, but he did possess one of the cell phones and a knife.  When asked on cross-examination whether the juvenile ""appear[ed] to have any control over"" the cocaine, Keenan replied that ""[h]e did not, nope.""', 'Based on his training and experience, Detective Keenan explained that multiple cell phones are often used in the distribution', 'Page 236', 'of narcotics.  Narcotics dealers keep both a personal phone and a phone for their illicit transactions.  Phones are often ""switched out"" after a couple of weeks or months ""if a person selling narcotics is nervous that maybe the police are on to them or their phone, . . . they dump it, and they get a new phone and a new number.  So they\'re constantly changing.  But . . . their own personal phone usually stays the same, and that\'s why . . . sometimes we do recover more than one cell phone off a single person.""', 'Keenan also testified that large sums of money, in different folds and denominations, often signifies drug distribution.  He explained that this is because ""a lot of times these deals happen this quick,"" and ""[t]he drugs go in one, the money goes in your pocket, and if you were buying a $40 bag of narcotics, you could have two 20s or some denomination of $40.  If it\'s 100, you could have five 20s, and that\'s why we find the different denominations.  It\'s denoting the sales of the drug trafficker.""', '2.  Discussion.

To evaluate this claim, we apply the same test as if we were evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction.

Commonwealth v. Lao,', ', 779 (2005).  Indeed, a joint venture may be proved wholly by circumstantial evidence.  See Commonwealth v. Bright,', "", 435 (2012).  When we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the juvenile's claim of mere presence is defeated by several facts, and the reasonable inferences drawn from those facts.  Detective Keenan's investigation began in a Quincy neighborhood known for drug activity where he had made arrests in the past."", 'His attention was drawn to the blue Infiniti, in which the juvenile was the front seat passenger.  After Keenan saw an individual he knew leave the car, he followed the car on its seemingly meaningless path through residential south Quincy and into Braintree, and then its return on a nearly identical path.  Having watched the car retrace its route, Keenan believed the car was conducting counter surveillance, which is a tactic used by drug traffickers to detect a police presence.', 'Once the car stopped, Detective Keenan saw Andrade, the back seat passenger, put his hand to the floor, directly behind the juvenile, where the transparent plastic bag', 'containing twenty-', 'Page 238', 'three individual bags of cocaine was found in plain view', ""and within the juvenile's reach.  After the juvenile and the other occupants were removed from the car, each was found in possession of a knife.  Although the juvenile had but a single cell phone in his possession, a total of seven cell phones were seized.  As Keenan explained to the jury, multiple cell phones are often used in the distribution of narcotics.  Also, more than $2,000 was recovered from the three occupants of the car.  Even though Cardoza possessed most of the money, each occupant possessed multiple folds of money in different denominations that to Keenan could signify it was the proceeds from the fast-moving business of drug distribution."", 'See Commonwealth v. Crapps,', ', 445 n.3 (2013) (cash and cell phone, in combination with other evidence, permitted finding of intent to exercise control over contraband in car).', 'From all of the evidence, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, the jury could conclude that:  the car was conducting counter surveillance to avoid the police discovering that the occupants were engaged in illegal drug activity; all three occupants of the car were similarly armed with a knife,', 'which implied', 'Page 239', ""an organized and collective effort; all three possessed different folds of money (totaling more than $2,000) and a total of seven cell phones, which both further indicated drug trade activity; the cocaine was in plain view and within the juvenile's reach; and the packaging and amount of the cocaine indicated that it was for sale.  See Commonwealth v. Scala,"", ', 511 (1980).  Viewing these facts collectively and in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury were entitled to employ their experience and common sense to reasonably conclude that the juvenile and the other occupants of the car were working together with a shared intent to, at the very least, commit the lesser included offense of possession of the cocaine in the car.  See Commonwealth v. Longo,', ', 487 (1988), quoting from Commonwealth v. Cerveny,', ', 287 (1982) (""The line that separates mere knowledge of unlawful conduct and participation in it, is \'often vague and uncertain.  It is within the province of the jury to determine from the evidence whether a particular defendant [has] crossed that line\'"").  A joint venture was properly established by the Commonwealth.  See Commonwealth v. Zanetti, 454 Mass. at 466; Commonwealth v. Bright, 463 Mass. at 435.  See also Commonwealth v. Drew,', ', 32 (1976) (""Whether an inference is warranted or is impermissibly remote must be determined, not by hard and fast rules of law, but by experience and common sense"").', '', 'This was not a simple case for the Commonwealth to prove.  The evidence of delinquency was far from indisputable.  But it is', 'Page 240', 'not our (or the dissent\'s) task to substitute our judgment or belief for that of the jury to determine whether the juvenile\'s delinquency has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 318-319.  Rather, our review is limited to whether a rational jury could have found that the juvenile possessed the cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt.  See id. at 319.  In other words, our appellate office does not permit us to reweigh the evidence ourselves to determine whether the jury made the correct delinquency determination but, rather, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we may only determine whether the jury made a rational decision regarding the juvenile\'s delinquency.  See Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 402 (1993).  Indeed, ""a reviewing court \'faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume -- even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record -- that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\'""  McDaniel v.

The jury were directed to return a general verdict.  See Commonwealth v. Zanetti,', ', 468 n.22 (2009).  In order to prove its case under either of these two theories, the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile had knowledge that the back seat passenger had the cocaine in his possession.  See Commonwealth v. Hamilton,', ', 410-411 (2013); Commonwealth v. Lugo,', ', 232 (2016).  Cf. Commonwealth v. Hernandez,', ', 694 (2003) (""Where it is a stash of cocaine that forms the basis for a charge of trafficking, a defendant can only share an intent to traffic if he knows the stash exists"").  Because I do not believe that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to infer that the juvenile sitting in the front seat had knowledge of the cocaine in the actual possession of the back seat passenger, I respectfully dissent.', '', 'The question before the court is whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile, who was in the front passenger seat of the car, had knowledge of the cocaine that was in the actual possession of the back seat passenger.', 'Discussion.  1.  The essential facts.  A very brief statement of the', 'Page 242', ""essential facts is necessary to clarify that evidence of the juvenile's knowledge of the cocaine in the possession of the back seat passenger is lacking.  There is no evidence of any interaction among the occupants of the car prior to or during the police stop.  When Detective Keenan approached the car on the back passenger's side, the only observation he made was that the back seat passenger, Louis Andrade, reached his hand to the floor."", ""Detective Keenan opened the back door and grabbed Andrade's hand, pinning it to the floor.  After Andrade was removed from the car, Detective Keenan found, on the seat where Andrade had been sitting, a bag that was small enough to fit in one's palm containing seven individual packages of cocaine.  Keenan stated that this bag had been under Andrade's buttocks.  Detective Keenan returned to the car after Andrade was secured and found a second bag of a similar size containing twenty-three individual packages of cocaine on the back floor where Andrade had reached with his hand.  There is no evidence that the juvenile made any gestures or spoke any words."", 'Each of the occupants had in his possession a knife, but no description of the knives was given.  Seven cellular telephones (cell phones) also were seized by the police.  The juvenile had only one cell phone on his person, and there was no evidence as to the location of the other cell phones.  The police found approximately $2,000 in cash, most of which was found in the possession of the driver.  The juvenile had $294 (of unspecified denominations) in his possession.  There is no evidence that any of the cash was located in plain view inside the car.  There is no evidence of any drug paraphernalia located in plain view inside the car.  There is no evidence that any item of property associated with the juvenile was found in proximity to the cocaine that was found in the back seat area.  Finally (and here I part company with the majority), there was no evidence that the cocaine seized from the back seat area where Andrade had been sitting was in the plain view of the juvenile.  See Commonwealth v. Snow,', ', 119-120 (2010) (discussing meaning of ""in plain view"").', ""2.  The foundation for an inference of personal knowledge is lacking.  Proof of the juvenile's presence in the passenger compartment"", 'Page 243', 'of a car where cocaine is found, by itself, is not sufficient to permit an inference that the juvenile had knowledge of the cocaine without ""other incriminating evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Albano,', ', 134 (1977).', 'The other incriminating evidence or ""plus factors""', ""that commonly supply the basis for an inference of knowledge are (1) that the contraband is found in plain view, (2) that the defendant is observed making a movement toward the contraband, (3) that personal property belonging to the defendant is found near the contraband, and (4) that the defendant makes a statement or engages in conduct that reflects consciousness of guilt.  See the Appendix to this opinion (collecting cases on plus factors in knowledge assessments).  None of these factors is present in this case, and the majority's reliance on the following factors is misplaced."", 'a.  Plain view.  After Andrade was removed from the back passenger seat, Keenan saw ""right under the seat where [Andrade] was sitting[,] not next to him like literally under his seat where he was sitting[,] . . . [a] bag and it had seven bags of individually packaged white powder [that Keenan] believed to be cocaine.""  Detective Keenan later described the location of this bag as having been ""under [Andrade\'s] buttocks where he was sitting.""', 'When Detective Keenan initially approached the car, he saw Andrade ""put [his hand] right down to the floor.""  Concerned that Andrade might have a weapon, Detective Keenan pinned Andrade\'s hand down and then raised it up and told Andrade to keep his hands in the air.  After Andrade was removed from the car and secured, Detective Keenan returned to the area of the back passenger seat where he had seen Andrade reach to the floor.  ""[O]n the floor [Keenan] could see right in front of [him] . . . a larger plastic bag and it had multiple bags of individually packaged white powder[,] . . . 23 in total which [Keenan] believed was cocaine.""  Detective Keenan later described the location of this bag as ""right where [Andrade] put his hand down[,] . . .', 'Page 244', 'right where [Keenan] pinned [Andrade\'s] hand, . . . right in that area that\'s where [Keenan] recovered the plastic bag and the 23 bags of cocaine in it.""', 'The two bags removed from the back passenger seat area were the only drugs found in the car.  When defense counsel cross-examined Detective Keenan about the size of these bags, the following exchange occurred:', 'Q.:  ""The cocaine, would it be fair to say that you could hide it in your fist?""', 'A.:  ""The smaller bag, very easily.  The bigger one might be a bit more.""', 'Q.:  ""Okay.  It might be hard to hide it in the fist?""', 'A.:  ""Yes.  You\'re saying hide it?""', 'Q.:  ""Well, I mean would it fit in your hand?""', 'A.:  ""Yes, absolutely.""', 'The majority states that a rational jury could infer that the cocaine, which Andrade had placed on the floor in front of the back passenger\'s side seat as Detective Keenan approached the car, was in the plain view of the juvenile where ""no barrier separated the juvenile from the back seat area.""  Ante at note 5.  In order for a front seat passenger to see a small item in the hand of a back seat passenger in a standard car, it is necessary for the front seat passenger to turn his body and look over or around his seat.  There is no evidence that the juvenile moved from the moment he was first observed by the police until he was removed from the car.  The absence of a ""barrier"" adds nothing to the basis for the inference that the juvenile had knowledge of the cocaine.', 'The majority states, ante at 237, that we must presume that the inference of knowledge was warranted based on the doctrine that an appellate court passing on the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.  See Commonwealth v. Merry,', ', 660-661 (2009).  Yet it is also settled doctrine that the mere possibility of an inferential fact (here, that the juvenile may have turned around in his seat and observed a small bag held by the back seat passenger) does not qualify as a reasonable and possible inference that a jury may draw from the evidence.  See id. at 661.  No less than in Commonwealth v. Ferguson,', ', 18 (1981), ""[t]he Commonwealth\'s theory of this case requires piling', 'Page 245', 'inference upon inference.""', 'Without this inference, the Commonwealth failed to connect the juvenile to the cocaine found in the possession of Andrade.', 'b.  High crime area.  The majority notes that the events took place ""in a Quincy neighborhood known for drug activity where [Detective Keenan] had made arrests in the past.""  Ante at 237.  Keenan\'s testimony, I submit, was far less suggestive.  He stated:  ""I\'ve conducted investigations and arrests in that general area.""', ""c.  Counter surveillance activity.  The majority also notes that Detective Keenan testified about counter surveillance, which he stated consisted of measures taken by a person to detect whether he or she is being followed by the police.  Ante at 234.  Detective Keenan testified that he found it significant that the car traveled in one direction for about three minutes, then it turned and traveled in the reverse direction before it was stopped.  What is absent from Detective Keenan's testimony and the majority opinion, however, is an explanation of why this conduct on the part of the driver is relevant to the knowledge or intent of the juvenile passenger.  The relevance, of course, depends on whether the juvenile was engaged in a joint venture with the driver and the back seat passenger -- which is a matter the Commonwealth alleged but failed to prove."", 'd.  Cocaine packaged for sale.  Detective Keenan\'s testimony about the significance of finding ""individually packaged [bags of drugs] for the street-level sales,"" certainly suggests that Andrade\'s possession was with the intent to distribute, but it contributes nothing to the question whether the juvenile had personal knowledge that the drugs were in the car.', 'e.  Knives and cell phones.  The majority also seeks to envelop the juvenile in a tapestry of guilty knowledge on the basis of other evidence as flimsy as gossamer.  The majority states that each of the three occupants had a knife, that a total of seven cell phones were seized by the police, and that ""more than $2,000 was recovered from the three occupants.""  Ante at 238.  None of this evidence, however, supports an inference that the juvenile had personal knowledge of the cocaine, or the intent and ability to control it.  See Commonwealth v. Cullity,', ', 1023-1024', 'Page 246', '(2015).  First, we know nothing about the knives,', 'and the judge instructed the jury that the location of the knives was ""irrelevant and immaterial"" and could not be considered.', ""Second, with regard to the $2,000, most of it was found on the person of the driver.  Ante at 242.  The majority's effort, ante at 238-239, to connect the $294 found on the juvenile"", 'to the money found on the driver or to drug trade activity rests entirely on speculation.', 'Third, the majority indicates that the seizure of the seven cell phones was significant because drug dealers use them to facilitate the distribution of drugs and frequently swap one for another.  Ante at 235-236, 238-239.  However, the evidence was that the juvenile possessed only one cell phone.  And there is no evidence as to the location of the other cell phones.', 'Page 247', ""3.  The relevant cases support the juvenile's position that he did not have constructive possession of the cocaine.  In an unbroken and lengthy line of appellate decisions, we have reiterated that being a passenger in a vehicle does not, without more, permit a jury to infer that the person has constructive possession of the contents of the vehicle."", 'While circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence may support the conclusion that a person had constructive possession of the drugs found inside a vehicle or was engaged in a joint venture with others in the vehicle, a plausible hypothesis of guilt is not a substitute for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,', ', 583 (2010).', '', 'Page 248', 'The cases relied upon by the majority are distinguishable from the case before us.  In Commonwealth v. Crapps,', ', 443 (2013), the police seized a sock containing cocaine from in the center console of a vehicle.  The defendant was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle.  Id. at 444.  The police found personal papers belonging to the defendant on the front passenger seat, a cell phone in the driver\'s side door pocket, and $585 in cash in the defendant\'s pocket, and they had observed the defendant engage in suspected drug dealing behavior.  Id. at 444-445.  In reasoning that the evidence was sufficient to permit a jury to infer that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the cocaine and the ability and intent to exercise control over it, we stated that ""[t]he evidence placed this case in the category of automobile decisions in which a defendant\'s proximity, access, and collateral conduct (here, his sole occupancy of the vehicle, and the brief visit by a suspected buyer) permitted the inference of an intention to exercise control over contraband or forbidden weaponry in the vehicle.""  Id. at 445.  Thus, although the presence of cash and a cell phone was used in Crapps to support a finding of intent to exercise control over the contraband -- unlike the case before us -- that evidence was supplemented with additional evidence.  Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Albano, 373 Mass. at 134-135, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a plainly visible firearm protruding from under the seat where the defendant driver was seated, ""an area to which he had easy access,"" combined with ""other incriminating evidence,"" was sufficient to permit a jury to find that he had knowledge of that firearm.  Id. at 134, 135.', 'Just as presence in the same location as the contraband, standing alone, is insufficient to establish knowledge of that contraband, presence alone is insufficient to establish a joint venture.  See Commonwealth v. Deane,', ', 50 (2010).  Our', 'Page 249', 'decision in Commonwealth v. Maillet,', ', 910 (2002), is a good illustration of the additional evidence needed to ""take a joint venture case to the jury.""  In Maillet, we identified this additional evidence as consisting of the following five plus factors.  First, as the drug dealer had told the undercover officer, who was posing as a buyer, that he (the dealer) would arrive at the parking lot in another individual\'s vehicle, the jury could infer that the defendant had learned why he was to drive to the parking lot.  Ibid.  Second, as the defendant had parked his vehicle so that it blocked the undercover officer\'s vehicle, the jury could infer that the defendant had been informed of the purpose of the meeting and the need to keep the undercover officer in check.  Id. at 910-911.  Third and fourth, as the defendant had been able to watch a third individual, who had exited from the defendant\'s vehicle, surveil the area, the jury could infer that this individual\'s actions would have informed the defendant that the individual was a lookout and that a crime was in progress.  Id. at 911.  Fifth, as the defendant had watched what happened in the undercover officer\'s vehicle, the jury could infer that the defendant saw the drug transaction and assisted in it by driving the dealer and the lookout away.  Ibid.  As this recitation indicates -- unlike the case before us -- the defendant\'s presence in Maillet was supplemented with additional evidence.', 'Although the determination whether the evidence was sufficient to support proof beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be reduced to a simple process of ""color matching"" with prior cases, I think our decision in Commonwealth v. Cormier,', '(1996), is analogous and should control the outcome here.  In Cormier, the defendant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine after police officers pulled over a speeding vehicle, in which he and two other men were present.  Id. at 76, 78.  The defendant was seated alone in the back seat.  Id. at 78.  The occupants were ordered to exit from the vehicle.  Ibid.  The front seat passenger was barefoot, while the driver and defendant were wearing shoes.  Ibid.  The police noticed a pair of white sneakers on the floor behind the front passenger seat and in front of where the defendant had been sitting.  Id. at 78-79.  As the officers began to search the vehicle, the driver moved to the vehicle, grabbed the sneakers, and attempted to flee.  Id. at 79.  The officers found more than one hundred grams of cocaine inside the sneakers.  Ibid.  On appeal, this court concluded that even though the sneakers containing the drugs were in close proximity to the defendant in the back seat', 'Page 250', 'area, the evidence was insufficient to permit an inference that the defendant had knowledge of the drugs where the drugs were inside the sneakers and not readily visible; the driver exercised control over the sneakers by attempting to flee with them; and another passenger, not the defendant, was barefoot.', 'Id. at 79-80.', ""Conclusion.  While it is not our role to weigh the evidence, it is our duty to overturn a jury's verdict that is based on inferences not shown to have been reasonable.  See, e.g., Corson v. Commonwealth,"", ', 198-200 (1998).  The majority opinion, in my view, overlooks an important nuance in the standard of review that is based on Jackson v.

We summarize the pertinent facts from the judge's findings on the motion to suppress, supplemented where appropriate by uncontroverted suppression hearing testimony that the judge explicitly or implicitly credited.  See Commonwealth v. Jones-Pannell,"", ', 431 (2015).  In April of 2015, Springfield police Officer Jaime Bruno, a narcotics investigator with fifteen years\' experience, was told by a confidential informant that on April 15, 2015, an individual named ""Gio,"" later identified as the defendant, would make a large delivery of heroin at the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle in East Springfield at about noon that day.  According to the informant, Gio would be driving a black Mini Cooper automobile, and the informant provided the license plate number.  The informant, with whom Officer Bruno had been in ""constant communication"" for the preceding seven to eight months, had previously provided information to Officer Bruno that resulted in numerous seizures and arrests.  The informant told Officer Bruno that he', ""had purchased heroin from Gio at that same intersection on several occasions, and also within the last seventy-two hours at Gio's residence at the Toll House Apartments in West Springfield.  Other officers confirmed that the defendant lived at the Toll House Apartments, and informed Officer Bruno that the defendant also had a residence at 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee."", 'The Springfield police had previously received complaints that nonresidents of the area were congregating at the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle.  On the morning of April 15, 2015, Officer Bruno went to that location to see for himself.  He', 'Page 525', 'observed two individuals standing at the intersection whom he had previously arrested for heroin offenses.', 'Later that morning, at approximately 10:00 a.m., surveillance officers observed the defendant and a Hispanic male leave the Toll House Apartments, place two large plastic containers in the back seat of the Mini Cooper, and drive it to 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee.  There, the defendant approached a red Honda automobile parked at the end of the driveway, opened the trunk with a key, and retrieved a black plastic bag the size of a softball.  He then reentered the Mini Cooper and drove in the direction of East Springfield.', 'The police followed in unmarked vehicles.  When the Mini Cooper was within approximately two miles of the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle, the defendant began driving in an erratic manner.  He drove up and down a number of side streets with no apparent destination, suddenly stopping and then accelerating beyond the speed limit.  This unusual driving caused Officer Bruno, based on his training and experience, to conclude that the defendant was attempting to determine if he was being followed.', ""The police stopped the Mini Cooper.  Officer Bruno removed the defendant and conducted a patfrisk for weapons.  He felt a large bulge in the defendant's pocket, which he recognized, based on his experience and the size and texture of the objects, as packets of heroin.  He then removed a black bag from the defendant's pocket, which appeared to be the one he had observed the defendant remove from the trunk of the red Honda.  Officer Bruno also removed a set of Honda car keys and three cellular telephones from the defendant's person."", ""The defendant was arrested.  The defendant pleaded with Officer Bruno for permission to telephone his girl friend; Officer Bruno declined.  Within minutes of the arrest, all three cellular telephones seized from the defendant began to ring and the unanswered calls continued for approximately ten minutes.  Concerned the delay in the defendant's arrival had alerted those waiting for the delivery of heroin to a potential problem such that the investigation had been compromised, Officer Bruno and other officers returned to 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee, arriving within ten to fifteen minutes of the defendant's arrest.  When, after five minutes, no one responded to Officer Bruno's announcement of police presence and knocks on two different doors, officers entered the Honda using the keys obtained from the defendant.  Several bricks of heroin and a firearm were seized from the trunk."", 'Page 526', 'Prior to the vehicle search, Officer Bruno had requested that Chicopee police officers provide a ""\'uniformed\' police presence at the scene given that the Springfield police officers were in plain clothes in unmarked vehicles and they might not be recognized as law enforcement.""

The defendant claims that the heroin found in his pocket should have been suppressed because the stop of the Mini Cooper was not supported by reasonable suspicion.  We disagree.

He had provided information to Officer Bruno on more than fifty prior occasions in the preceding seven to eight months.  The information provided by', 'Page 527', 'the informant led to ""well over fifteen"" seizures of drugs, resulting in multiple convictions.  We agree with the judge\'s conclusion that this evidence sufficiently established the informant\'s veracity.  See Commonwealth v.

Here, the informant reported that he had purchased heroin on several occasions from the defendant, whom he knew by name, both at the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle, and also at the defendant's residence, which he identified by address.  Moreover, it was reasonable to infer from the informant's detailed information that he had direct personal knowledge of the defendant's heroin distribution.  See Commonwealth v.

He described a transaction that was to occur at a specific intersection at a definite time and reported the make, color, and license plate number of the vehicle the defendant would be driving.  Independent police investigation confirmed that the defendant lived at the address provided by the informant, and had a second address in Chicopee.  Police also confirmed that the Mini Cooper described by the informant was registered to the defendant's girl friend."", 'The information provided by the informant was further corroborated when, approximately one hour before the drug transaction was to occur, police observed the defendant leave the Toll House Apartments in the Mini Cooper, drive to his residence at 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee, take a softball-sized black bag from the Honda, and then drive in the direction of the transaction predicted by the informant.  While following the defendant, the police reasonably concluded that he was engaged in counter surveillance as he drove evasively through a residential neighborhood.  In these circumstances, the judge correctly concluded that the police had more than reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant -- they had probable cause to arrest him.', '""[P]robable cause exists where, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the police are enough to warrant a prudent person in believing that the individual arrested has committed or was committing an offense.""', 'Page 528', 'Commonwealth v.

We consider the entire ""silent movie"" in a practical and nontechnical way, through the eyes of an experienced narcotics investigator.  Commonwealth v. Santaliz,', "", 242 (1992).  Applying these principles, we conclude that the information received from the informant, corroborated by police investigation and the defendant's attempts to evade surveillance, established probable cause that he was committing a drug offense.  Because the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant at the time they stopped the Mini Cooper, the search of the defendant's person was permissible incident to that lawful arrest.

L. c. 276, § 2A, implicitly authorizes any Massachusetts law enforcement officer to execute search warrants anywhere', 'Page 529', 'in the Commonwealth, the clear language of the statute applies only to searches executed pursuant to a warrant.  It does not apply to warrantless searches like the one in this case.  The Commonwealth cites no authority, and we have found none, permitting a warrantless search by a Massachusetts police officer acting outside his territorial jurisdiction.', 'Here, it is undisputed that the warrantless search of the Honda was conducted by the Springfield police in the city of Chicopee, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Springfield police department.  Although the Chicopee police were called for assistance, they were not involved in the investigation and were not present at the time the search was conducted.  Thus, the Springfield police acted outside their authority, and the contraband seized from the Honda in Chicopee should have been suppressed.  See Commonwealth v. Lahey,', ', 610 (2011) (""The appropriate remedy for unauthorized extraterritorial action is suppression of the resulting evidence"").', ""For the first time on appeal, the Commonwealth argues that even if the police exceeded their territorial authority, the exclusionary rule should not apply because the evidence seized from the Honda would have inevitably been discovered.  The Commonwealth's theory of inevitable discovery is that the Chicopee police, upon their arrival, would have conducted a lawful search of the Honda within their territorial jurisdiction.  We are not persuaded."", '""[T]he Commonwealth has the burden of proving the facts bearing on inevitability by a preponderance of the evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Ubilez,', ', 817-818 (2016), quoting from Commonwealth v. Perrot,', ', 547 (1990).  ""The motion judge\'s findings [on inevitable discovery] should be specific and detailed.""  Lahey, supra at 613.  ""Once the relevant facts are found by a preponderance of the evidence, the question is whether on those facts discovery by lawful means was certain as a practical matter.""  Commonwealth v.

Id. at 117 n.4.', 'Even assuming there was a lawful basis to search the Honda without a warrant,', 'a question we do not reach, we cannot conclude that a lawful search by the Chicopee police was ""virtually', 'Page 530', 'certain.""  Perrot, supra.  Indeed, at the time the search was conducted by the Springfield police, even the arrival of the Chicopee police, although anticipated, was not certain.  Moreover, because the theory of inevitable discovery was not advanced at the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth did not elicit testimony to support it, and the judge\'s comprehensive memorandum of decision included no findings related to inevitable discovery.  Accordingly, on the record before us, we cannot conclude that ""discovery by lawful means was certain as a practical matter.""  O\'Connor, supra.', ""Conclusion.

We affirm.', 'Background.  We set forth the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented where necessary with uncontroverted evidence drawn from the record of the suppression hearing.  See Commonwealth v. Watson,', ', 726 n.5 (2000).', 'Sergeant William West of the Billerica police department testified that he had been a patrol sergeant for two years, and that he had formerly been a detective in the criminal bureau for sixteen years.  As a detective, he had investigated all types of crimes including narcotics offenses and had worked with informants ""no less than a hundred times.""  In June, 2013, about one year after he had become a sergeant, West was contacted by a CI with whom West had worked on more than one occasion when he was a detective.', 'On this occasion, the CI provided a description of a man who went by the name of ""Eddie,"" later identified as the defendant, who was dealing heroin and cocaine in and around the Gaelic Club (club) in Lowell.  The CI described the defendant as a Dominican male who drove a white Buick Rendezvous CXL sport utility vehicle bearing license plate 676 NB4.  The CI indicated that on Friday nights the defendant used the club as a base of operation and that the CI personally observed the defendant make cocaine sales in the club\'s bathroom.  The CI also indicated that the defendant would receive telephone calls and travel to individuals\' homes to sell drugs.  The CI also told West that the defendant usually carried a firearm and the CI believed the defendant did not have a valid driver\'s license.', ""Because West was no longer involved in narcotics investigations and because the club was in Lowell, not Billerica, he passed the CI's tip and contact number to Sergeant Noone of the Lowell"", 'Page 8', 'police department.  West explained to Noone that the CI was an informant who had been ""signed up by Billerica"" and had been reliable in the past, including having given information that led to arrests and seizures.  Noone assigned the matter to Lowell police Detective Rafael Rivera.  When Rivera spoke by phone with the CI, the CI repeated what he had disclosed to West and that he had seen the defendant in the club only a ""couple of days before,"" in possession of drugs and his gun.  Rivera ran the license plate number the CI had given him and the records showed that the vehicle was registered to Kennedy Ruiz-Mejia.', '', 'On Friday, June 28, 2013, at about 7:25 p.m., Rivera and three other undercover officers, in four separate vehicles, set up surveillance around the club.  Rivera saw a vehicle matching the make, model, license plate, and color supplied by the CI.  After a few minutes, a man matching the description of ""Eddie"" exited the club, got into the vehicle, and drove away.  When the vehicle turned into a gasoline station, Lowell police Detective Michael Kandrotas pulled in behind it, activating the concealed lights and siren on his unmarked cruiser.', 'Kandrotas exited his vehicle and, as he approached, observed the driver make a quick movement to his right, as if to toss something into the back seat.  Because the defendant had been reported to carry a firearm, Kandrotas had the defendant exit the vehicle.  Rivera joined Kandrotas and recognized the defendant as someone he knew from prior narcotics investigations.', ""Rivera confirmed through dispatch that the defendant did not have a current driver's license.  The defendant was placed under arrest for operating a vehicle without a license.  Rivera searched the defendant and found $5,100 on his person.  The defendant was transported to the police station.  During booking, it was determined that the defendant had an alias of Eddie Mambru."", ""Because the defendant's vehicle was blocking a gasoline pump, and the police were going to search it, the police moved it across the street to a school parking lot after the defendant was arrested.  The Lowell inventory policy, which was introduced at the motion hearing, provides for the inventory and towing of a vehicle that was, or is, being used in the commission of a crime.  When police opened the rear door, they observed a loaded .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun poorly concealed in a sock on the floor.  In a"", 'Page 9', 'second sock, police recovered twenty-seven bags, each containing a powder later confirmed to be cocaine.', ""The motion judge found that the police had conducted an investigatory stop based on information supplied by the CI.

Depina,', ', 243 (2010).', 'Applying this standard, the judge ruled that the CI\'s basis of knowledge was self-evident from the tip and founded on personal observation.  On the veracity prong, according to West, ""The information [the CI] provided allowed [West] to seize various types of narcotics, make drug seizures and drug arrests, as well as seizing money, the proceeds of drug profits.""  Through cross-examination, defense counsel elicited that individuals who make controlled buys are considered to be ""informant[s]""; that ""if [a] person had, in fact, made a series of purchases on behalf of the Billerica [p]olice [d]epartment, [West] could honestly say that that individual had provided [West] with information that if it did lead to arrest, to arrest and seizure . . .

The Commonwealth did not ask West on redirect examination whether the CI previously had been a tipster and not merely a controlled buyer.  The judge specifically found:  ""I understand [West\'s] testimony to mean that the CI supplied substantive information as well as helping with controlled buys.""

The motion judge gave West\'s testimony regarding the CI\'s prior track record its plain and ordinary meaning, namely that on more than one previous occasion the CI had directly provided material information regarding violations of the law and, further, that the CI provided ""substantive information.""  The judge\'s finding of fact comports with the language West used, the testimony that the informant had been reliable in the past, and the common situation presented in police work in which a CI provides material information regarding criminal violations and is then engaged to execute a controlled buy.', 'See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Similarly unavailing is the defendant's claim that the search of the vehicle was unreasonable.  After the defendant was arrested, because his vehicle was blocking the pumps at a gasoline station that was open for business, the police moved the vehicle across the street.  Regardless of how the police described the ensuing search, the incriminating objects found during the search would have been discovered during the inevitable inventory search conducted before police had the vehicle towed.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The defendant cross-examined Eyerly regarding the basis on which he formed his opinion, the testing procedures used, and their susceptibility to human error.  We discern no error or any violation of the defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him under the United States Constitution or the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights."", 'Judgments affirmed.', '', ""I dissent from the court's holding that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant.  Since all evidence discovered was the fruit of an unconstitutional stop, the motion to suppress should have been allowed."", 'In this case, a confidential informant described a Dominican male who drove a white Buick Rendezvous CXL sport utility vehicle of which the confidential informant recited the license plate number.  The confidential informant indicated that on Friday nights the man could be found at the Gaelic Club.  He said that the', 'Page 14', ""man used it as a base of operation, traveling to individuals' homes to sell drugs, and that he personally observed the man make cocaine sales in the club's bathroom.

They then set up surveillance outside the Gaelic Club on a Friday night and saw the car, and when a Hispanic-appearing male, the defendant, left the club, got in, and drove away, the police stopped the car.  They had not entered the club.  They had not seen the defendant engage in drug sales or any other suspicious activity."", 'Under Massachusetts law, we utilize the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli test', 'to determine whether a tip can provide the reasonable suspicion that criminality is afoot necessary to allow an investigative stop.  The veracity prong requires the Commonwealth to demonstrate ""that the source of the information was credible or the information reliable.""  Commonwealth v. Depiero,', ', 454 (2016).  The central issue in this case, as the court recognizes, is the veracity of the confidential informant.', ""The court also recognizes, and I agree, that, as the motion judge also correctly concluded, the Commonwealth could have established the informant's veracity only by showing that the informant had been a tipster in the past, and not merely a controlled buyer.  This is because, while it is well established that an informant's history of providing tips leading to the seizure of narcotics can establish the informant's veracity, see Commonwealth v. Perez-Baez,"", ', 45 (1991), as we have held, one who merely participates in controlled buys is a person of ""unknown reliability.""  Commonwealth v. Carrasquiello,', ', 776 (1998).  See id. at 774-777 (distinguishing the veracity of tipsters from that of controlled buyers).  This is because while buying drugs on behalf of the police does provide them with information, it does not entail providing them with any information the police have not generated themselves.  See ibid.  See also Commonwealth v. Desper,', ', 168 (1994) (describing the process of controlled buys).', 'Page 15', ""And, while corroboration of certain details of a tip can lead to a conclusion that the person who provided it was truthful, confirmation only of the publicly-knowable and not suspicious facts provided by the tipster that a person who drives a certain car goes to a particular club on Friday evenings is insufficient to demonstrate the veracity of the tipster's claim that the person also engages in unlawful conduct.  See Commonwealth v. Lyons,"", ', 20-21 (1990) (""[T]he quantity and quality of the details corroborated by the police were simply insufficient to establish any degree of suspicion that could be deemed reasonable.  The trooper was able to verify only the description of the automobile, the direction in which it was headed, and the race and gender of the occupants before making the stop. . . .  [T]he informant\'s reliability was only slightly enhanced by this corroboration because the police verified no predictive details that were not easily obtainable by an uninformed bystander. . . .  Significantly . . . these defendants displayed no suspicious behavior that might have heightened police concern.  Anyone can telephone the police for any reason"").', 'In this case, the only evidence of the informant\'s past involvement with the police came from Sergeant William West\'s testimony.  On direct examination, he testified that, in the past, the informant had provided ""information"" that led to drug arrests and the seizure of money and narcotics.', 'In cross-examination, though, the defendant\'s experienced counsel asked Sergeant West, ""And if [an individual utilized by the Billerica police department to make controlled buys] had, in fact, made a series of purchases on behalf of the Billerica [p]olice [d]epartment, you could honestly say that that individual had provided you with information that if it did lead to arrest, to arrest and seizure, is that fair to say?""  The sergeant said, ""Yes.""  Counsel then asked, ""In the past was [the informant in this case] able to make controlled buys for you when you did use him as an informant for the Billerica [p]olice [d]epartment?""  Again, the sergeant said, ""Yes.""', ""The Commonwealth bears the burden of demonstrating the lawfulness of the seizure and thus in this case, in order to demonstrate the veracity of the tip, that the confidential informant had previously acted as a tipster and not merely as a controlled buyer.  Defense counsel's careful cross-examination made clear that, according to Sergeant West himself, even if one had taken Sergeant West's direct testimony to mean that the informant had"", 'Page 16', ""provided tips in the past, that was not necessarily its meaning.  While West's testimony left open the possibility that the confidential informant might have been a tipster as well as a controlled buyer, the officer's direct testimony did not mean that the informant was such a tipster."", ""The Commonwealth could have clarified the matter on redirect by asking Sergeant West whether the informant had ever provided tips.  It declined to do so.  Perhaps this was because it knew that the confidential informant in fact was not a tipster; perhaps it was not.  But in either event, the Commonwealth, which, it bears repeating, has the burden here, left a record in which there was insufficient evidence to support the finding, necessary to the motion judge's conclusion that the search was lawful, that the confidential informant had previously been a tipster, not only a controlled buyer."", '', 'The Commonwealth recognized this below, and did not even argue before the judge that the evidence supported a finding that the confidential informant was a tipster.  Defense counsel argued:  ""At no time did the sergeant ever say that this informant was a tipster. . . .  I didn\'t ask him.  My brother didn\'t ask him. . . .  [A]ll we know about this person, this informant"" is that ""[h]e has performed controlled buys successfully . . . .  We don\'t know whether he was ever a tipster.  [West] was never asked.""', 'The Commonwealth did not disagree, arguing only (and incorrectly) that any information leading to ""an arrest and seizure of contraband substances was by itself sufficient to establish reliability,"" and that, coupled with the details that were corroborated, it was sufficient.', '', ""The court majority addresses the state of the record with respect to the confidential informant by saying first that we must defer to the motion judge's assessment of Sergeant West's credibility.  Of course we must.  But the issue is not whether Sergeant"", 'Page 17', 'West is credible, nor did the judge say it was.', 'The issue is what Sergeant West said.  I assume he was perfectly credible.  His testimony, though, cannot support a finding that the confidential informant provided tips in the past.  It is silent on that question.', 'The court majority then suggests that the ""more important[]"" reason we must affirm is that we must defer to the fact finder\'s choice between ""two permissible views of the evidence.""  Ante at 11.  That statement of black letter law is of course true as well, but it is equally irrelevant.', ""To illustrate the point:  If there were testimony that an event happened on a weekend, a judge could not infer solely on that basis that the day on which it happened was a Saturday rather than a Sunday.  That would not be a case in which one could draw one of two permissible inferences from the evidence in the record (i.e., that it happened on a Saturday or that it happened on a Sunday).  It would be one in which there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a conclusion on the matter in either direction.  The event might have happened on a Saturday.  Or it might have happened on a Sunday.  But there is no basis upon which a fact finder could, without more, determine which one.  And if it was one party's burden to prove the event happened on a Saturday, that party would have failed to meet its burden."", ""That is precisely this case.  Whatever one might have thought initially about Sergeant West's direct testimony, given his own clarification on cross-examination, it meant only that the confidential informant might have been a tipster (and a controlled buyer as well), or that he might have been only a controlled buyer.  But there was no evidence in the record to support the judge's conclusion that the informant was the former rather than the latter.  Choosing between two different possible factual scenarios, either of which might have happened, where there is no evidence in the record about which one actually did occur, is far different than choosing between two permissible views of the evidence in the record, and there would be little left of the rule of law if we eliminated that distinction."", 'Page 18', ""Because the Commonwealth did not provide sufficient evidence to support a positive finding about the veracity of the confidential informant, it failed to demonstrate the reasonable suspicion necessary for the initial stop of the defendant's vehicle.  While I have no quarrel with the rest of the majority's analysis, because all the evidence seized was fruit of that unlawful stop, it should have been suppressed.

Detective Williams obtained the cellular telephone"", 'Page 22', 'records for the number provided by Cassio, which showed that ""Bill Desops"" was the subscriber.  The records also showed that telephone calls were made within moments of the shooting to a cellular telephone number that police identified as belonging to Dorisca.  Thereafter, Detective Williams spoke to Cassio again, but was unsuccessful in eliciting information about the nature of those telephone calls or Dorisca\'s location.  During the interview, Detective Williams recognized Cassio from a videotape that he had seen.', '', 'As the second judge found, that videotape, recorded several months before the homicide, captured Cassio, ""a person named Rinaldi Lauradin, and others flashing large sums of money and discussing the movement of drugs from Florida to Massachusetts.""  A gun could also be seen in the footage.  Detective Williams testified that ""the tape clearly displays [Cassio] and other members engaged in what seems to be very lucrative drug dealings. . . .  And bragging and boasting of going to Florida to obtain more drugs.  And they\'re flashing tens of thousands of dollars on this tape.""', 'About one month after the homicide, Detective Williams spoke to Cassio\'s brother, Kennell.  Kennell reported that Cassio was now using a different cellular telephone number, and that Cassio was on his way to New York with ""Paco"" and ""Paquito.""  Further investigation revealed that Paco was the defendant and Paquito was Stevenson Allonce.  After speaking with Kennell, the Commonwealth sought and obtained an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) (2006) requiring the cellular telephone carrier to provide the records and the so-called ""running location"" of that different telephone, going forward, to assist in finding Dorisca and to investigate Cassio.', 'The carrier was required to provide Detective Williams with the cellular telephone\'s location every fifteen minutes prospectively.  The carrier ""pinged"" the telephone at fifteen-minute intervals, an action that is not routinely', 'Page 23', 'undertaken by cellular telephone carriers.', 'The defense expert explained that the ""ping"" sends a communication signal to the cellular telephone and requires the cellular telephone to communicate with the nearby cell tower.  See generally Commonwealth v. Augustine, 467 Mass. at 237-238.  The carrier can identify the location of the cell tower by coordinates of longitude and latitude.  The carrier then sends, in this case to Detective Williams, this information and the maximum distance the cellular telephone can be from that cell tower, based on the strength and location of nearby cell towers.', 'The CSLI records showed that the defendant, not Desops, was the subscriber of the cellular telephone that Cassio was then using.  The billing address on those records was 220-222 Howard Street, apartment 2.  The records also reflected that the defendant had yet another cellular telephone number.', 'State police Trooper Eric Telford assisted in the homicide investigation.  He knocked on doors, spoke to family members, and tried to obtain information about individuals close to Dorisca.  On the evening of July 2, 2008, Trooper Telford was contacted by a confidential informant.  The informant told Trooper Telford that Cassio was headed to Florida in a brown Toyota RAV4 sport utility vehicle (SUV) rental to pick up a large quantity of narcotics.  As a result, Trooper Telford thought that Dorisca may intend to hide out in Florida.', 'From July 2 to July 8, 2008, Detective Williams confirmed, through CSLI data, that Cassio, Allonce, and the defendant made a trip to Florida.  The CSLI data also showed that the cellular telephone was traveling south toward Florida and came to a stop in Sunrise, Florida.  When the signal was stationary in Sunrise, Detective Williams contacted the local police.  Using the CSLI data, the Sunrise police found a brown Toyota, with a Massachusetts registration, and through additional surveillance and communication with Massachusetts police, identified Cassio, Allonce, and the defendant as the three individuals using the Toyota.  On', 'Page 24', 'July 7, 2008, the CSLI data indicated that the cellular telephone was moving north.  When the telephone was shut off for a period of time during the trip, Detective Williams could not track it.', 'On July 8, 2008, Detective Williams again began receiving CSLI information as the Toyota approached the Massachusetts border.  He alerted the Brockton and the Randolph', 'police that the Toyota was returning to the area.  At 2:15 p.m., Detective Williams was notified that the telephone pinged at or near Howard Street.  Trooper Telford and State police Trooper Francis Walls, together with other officers, arrived at 220 Howard Street shortly after this ping was received.', ""Trooper Telford observed Cassio standing in front of the Howard Street building with an individual who matched Dorisca's description.  He watched Cassio and the other individual get into the Toyota and drive away.  Troopers Telford and Walls followed.  When the driver made a left turn without using a directional signal, the troopers stopped the Toyota.  The driver was identified as Cassio and the passenger was identified as Allonce, not Dorisca.  The two stated that the defendant had been traveling with them, that they had just come from his house, and that they were going to the Brockton police department to speak to Detective Williams about the homicide.  The Toyota was filled with clothing, luggage, a pillow, a cooler, and other items.  Trooper Telford had the two occupants step out of the Toyota so they could check for Dorisca.  When Trooper Telford confirmed Dorisca was not hiding in the Toyota, he permitted Cassio and Allonce to continue on their way.  Ping data that Detective Williams received showed that the cellular telephone came to rest near the Brockton police station at about 3:45 p.m. on July 8, 2008."", 'Troopers Telford and Walls returned to 220 Howard Street to look for Dorisca, to find and speak to the defendant, and to investigate the possible drug connection to the property.  Trooper Telford directed other officers to that location to assist him.  When Troopers Telford, Walls, and Jackson arrived, they approached a man on the front porch.  As Trooper Walls began to speak to him, a female and a male came out of the first-floor apartment.  While Trooper Telford walked around to the rear of the house, Trooper Walls explained to the couple that the police were looking for a homicide suspect and that they thought that he might be inside their apartment.  The couple agreed to allow both troopers inside', 'Page 25', 'and walked them through every room of their apartment.  The troopers were taken through the back door to the exit, which opened into a common rear entry area.  There was a door to the outside from that common area, as well as stairs to the second and third floors.', 'Troopers Walls and Jackson used the rear stairs to go to the second-floor apartment, where the occupant of that apartment met them in the hallway.  They repeated their request and were again granted permission to look for Dorisca in that apartment.  Finding nothing, both troopers continued to the attic.  At the top of the stairs there was a large open landing area, without any door.  Off of the landing area, there were four doors, which led to two bedrooms, a storage area, and a crawl space.  The only way to secure the attic would be to lock the entry door located in the common area on the first floor.  Three of the four doors in the attic were open and the troopers looked in each space.  A television was in the front bedroom, and junk was piled in the storage room.  There was no bathroom or shower on this floor.', ""The troopers knocked on the closed, fourth door several times before the defendant opened it and came into the landing area.  They asked the defendant his name and, when he told them, they asked if he had a nickname; he said it was Paco.  Because Trooper Walls knew Paco was a name related to the drug investigation Trooper Telford was working on, he contacted Trooper Telford and asked him to come up to the attic.  In the meantime, Troopers Jackson and Walls explained that they were looking for Dorisca.  They obtained the defendant's verbal permission to do a quick walk-through of the defendant's room, which turned up nothing significant.  The defendant said he lived there and was paying $400 in rent per month."", 'Trooper Telford, who had been outside, walked through the rear entry door to the common hallway and came up the back stairs to the attic.  Trooper Telford read the defendant his Miranda rights and explained to him why the troopers were there.  The defendant said that he had gone to Florida with his friends to attend a family reunion for Allonce.  The defendant denied having any drugs in his room and signed a consent to search form.', ""During the subsequent search, police found about $2,200 in a cupboard in the defendant's bedroom.  After a narcotics-trained dog arrived in the attic, police located a pillowcase in the crawl space that contained about two kilograms of what police believed to be cocaine.  That pillowcase matched a pillowcase found in the Toyota.  The defendant denied any knowledge of the contraband."", 'Page 26', 'Based on this evidence, the third motion judge ruled that the defendant had standing to challenge the search because the tracking continued while the police searched 220 Howard Street.  The judge also determined that the defendant\'s reasonable expectation of privacy under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights was violated where the police tracked his ""movements for seven days through the collection of CSLI obtained from a cell phone registered to him but used by [another].""  With respect to the search, the judge agreed with the Commonwealth that no warrant was required to obtain subscriber information from the carrier.  However, the judge determined that under Commonwealth v. Augustine, 467 Mass. at 257, the failure of the Commonwealth to acquire a warrant for the CSLI rendered that evidence illegally obtained.  The judge found that because the police learned, only through the unlawful CSLI, that the cocaine was likely brought to Howard Street, their seizure of the cocaine was the result of ""exploiting the unlawful electronic tracking through CSLI.""  The judge further found that ""[t]he search and seizure was not attenuated"" from the illegality and thus ""[t]he evidence obtained during that search must therefore be suppressed.""', 'Discussion.  In reviewing a judge\'s ruling on a motion to suppress, ""we accept the judge\'s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \'but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\'""  Commonwealth v. Scott,', ', 646 (2004), quoting from Commonwealth v. Jimenez,', ', 218 (2002).', '1.  Standing.  On appeal, the Commonwealth does not dispute that the CSLI was illegally obtained.  Rather, the Commonwealth argues that the defendant does not have standing to challenge the search of the cellular telephone.', 'Where a defendant claims the search of the cellular telephone violated his rights under art. 14 and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, we must determine initially whether the defendant has ""standing to contest the search and then whether [he] had an expectation of privacy in the area searched.""  Commonwealth v. Williams,', ', 207-208 (2009).  ""Although the two concepts are interrelated, we consider them separately. . . .  A defendant has standing either if [he] has a possessory interest in the place searched or in the property seized or if [he] was present when the search occurred.""  Id. at 208.  Here, regardless of whether the defendant allowed Cassio to use the cellular telephone, because the defendant was', 'Page 27', 'the registered owner of the telephone and the billing address was his, he had a possessory interest in the telephone sufficient to grant him automatic standing.  He also had actual standing because his movements were being tracked when the telephone was pinged by the carrier during the trip he took with Cassio to Florida.', ""There also was a search in the constitutional sense.  The defendant has a reasonable expectation not to be subjected to extended CSLI tracking by the government, even if he is merely a passenger in a vehicle controlled by the primary suspect.  The government's monitoring of the defendant's movements -- for more than six days -- is sufficient to establish that he has standing to challenge the validity of the search of the cellular telephone.  Commonwealth v. Rousseau,"", ', 382 (2013).', '', ""2.  Exclusionary rule.  The Commonwealth argues alternatively, that the CSLI information was so attenuated from the seizure of the inculpatory evidence that suppression is not required.  Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that the evidence subsequently seized from the Howard Street attic ought not to be excluded because it is too attenuated from the illegality.  The Commonwealth's concession is based on Augustine, where the court held that government-compelled production of CSLI data by cellular telephone carriers is a search in the constitutional sense, requiring a warrant under art. 14.  467 Mass. at 252-255."", ""We pause to note that the CSLI ordered to be produced in Augustine involved historical CSLI, which was generated from telephone calls already made to or from the cellular telephone in question.  The related records, which show the cell towers from which connection to telephone calls were made, and through which the locus of the cellular telephone's location can be pinpointed, are maintained by the carrier in the ordinary course of business.  Id. at 239-240 & n.24.  The § 2703(d) order obtained in this case required the carrier to create CSLI that was not routinely created or retained.  That is, the carrier was required to prospectively ping a cellular telephone every fifteen minutes for more"", 'Page 28', 'than six days, solely for the purpose of finding and providing location information for the police.  There is no question that under the rationale of Augustine, a warrant was also required in this case, where the carrier not only was compelled to turn over CSLI data, but to create particular prospective CSLI that it otherwise would not have created.  See id. at 240 n.24 (""The privacy interest raised by historical CSLI may be the same as prospective, or \'real-time,\' CSLI"").', 'Because a warrant for the particular evidence from the cellular telephone registered to the defendant was required but not obtained, the ""crucial question"" regarding whether the evidence must be suppressed as tainted fruit is whether it came ""by exploitation of . . . [the illegal search] or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.""  Commonwealth v. Estabrook,', ', 860 (2015) (citation omitted).  See Commonwealth v. Bradshaw,', ', 258 (1982), citing Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963).  Relying on these principles, we consider the evidence at issue.', 'In this case, the troopers first spoke to the defendant when he responded to their repeated knocking by opening the only closed door in the attic and entering the landing area.', 'After the defendant gave permission to Troopers Walls and Jackson to do a quick walk-through of his room for Dorisca, Trooper Telford arrived and spoke to the defendant.  He read the defendant his Miranda rights and then ""explained to him that [they] were there searching for [Dorisca], who was a homicide suspect, and that', 'Page 29', '[they] also had information that he, and Mr. Azario [sic], and the other defendant there, Allonce, had just gone down to Florida and purchased a large amount of narcotics and they were possibly storing it there.""  This statement was based directly on the tainted CSLI and while it was intertwined with other independent evidence, the inquiry exploited the improperly obtained CSLI.  Commonwealth v. Estabrook, supra at 864-865.', 'Specifically, the police knew from a somewhat dated videotape that existed prior to the CSLI that Cassio had traveled to Florida to buy large amounts of narcotics.  In addition, they had statements from Kennell that Cassio was traveling to New York with the defendant and Allonce.  They also had statements from an informant (who Trooper Telford had not previously used) that Cassio (without reference to any other individuals) was going to Florida to buy narcotics in a brown Toyota.  They also knew from Kennell that Cassio was using a cellular telephone number that was registered to the defendant and was billed to 220 Howard Street.  The CSLI, however, provided the only direct and reliable evidence that the defendant had ""just"" participated in a trip to Florida.  Indeed, Massachusetts authorities used the CSLI to direct police in Sunrise, Florida, to the location where the cellular telephone came to rest, and from where, through surveillance, identification details from the Toyota and its occupants were relayed back.', 'The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\'s statements and the subsequent discovery of the evidence are admissible because they were attenuated from the initial illegal search of the CSLI.  We disagree for the reasons stated in Commonwealth v. Estabrook, supra.  The defendant was not confronted with any question based on his CSLI until he spoke with Trooper Telford, after the defendant answered the knock on his attic room door.  Indeed, when Trooper Telford confronted the defendant with evidence of this tainted CSLI, including that the information that the defendant had just returned from Florida, there is no evidence that the defendant was aware that the police knew he had traveled to Florida.  Insofar as the defendant is concerned, his statement and his consent to search, given ""in direct response to confrontation with evidence of his CSLI[,] were made in close proximity to the illegality, and there were no intervening circumstances between the police questions based on the CSLI and [the defendant\'s]', 'Page 30', 'responses thereto.""', 'Ibid.  The defendant\'s statements therefore must be suppressed.  ""[T]he connection between the illegality and the granting of consent was \'sufficiently intimate\' that the consent cannot be found to have been so attenuated from the [exploitation of the CSLI] as to be purged from its taint.""  Commonwealth v. Gentile,', ', 831 (2014).', ""As for the cash found in the cupboard in the defendant's bedroom, there is certainly some question that the defendant was not being truthful when he said the room was his home, particularly given the lack of a bathroom or a shower.  Nonetheless, the defendant kept it locked and he was inside when the police arrived.  For the reasons discussed supra, we conclude that the defendant's consent to search was tainted by the police exploitation of the illegally obtained CSLI and therefore, his statement to police before the search and the cash found in his bedroom must be suppressed."", ""With respect to the search of the crawl space, however, the defendant's consent was not required.  The facts regarding the access to, use, and layout of the attic were carefully developed during the evidentiary hearings.  The crawl space was accessible to any tenant by entering through the ground level exterior door in the rear of the dwelling, which was apparently left unlocked, and walking up the stairs to the attic.  There, off of the main landing, were several rooms or areas with open doors, including the crawl space.  Items found in the rooms with open doors suggested that tenants stored or disposed of possessions they did not need or want in that location.  The cocaine was found in a pillowcase in that attic crawl space.  Because the crawl space was within this common area in a multiunit building, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in items left there.  See Commonwealth v. Thomas,"", ', 774-775 (1971); Commonwealth v. Montanez,', ', 302 (1991); Commonwealth v. Holley,', ', 551-552 (2011).  See also Commonwealth v. Connolly,', ', 624, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 843 (1970) (""Since the basement was a common area freely available to all the tenants, one tenant could give permission to its search"").  As a matter of law, the police were permitted', 'Page 31', 'to search the crawl space without the defendant\'s consent and without a warrant.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Williams, 453 Mass. at 209 (Because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in space searched, he ""cannot challenge the police action that occurred there"").  The cocaine therefore, need not be suppressed.', ""We address one outstanding issue.  When this case was remanded in 2015 by the single justice, it was with the instruction to consider the defendant's motion to suppress in light of several recently decided cases, specifically Commonwealth v. Augustine.  Despite this instruction, neither the Commonwealth nor the third motion judge addressed that portion of Augustine in which the court considered whether the § 2703(d) application provided probable cause to obtain the CSLI and, if so, the failure to seek a warrant to obtain CSLI would not require suppression of that evidence.  467 Mass. at 255-256.  Nor did the Commonwealth raise the issue in its brief on appeal, although the matter was briefly touched on at oral argument, over the defendant's objection.  Because of the lengthy and somewhat unusual procedural posture of this case and the specific instruction from the single justice to consider Augustine, we address the issue in the interest of judicial economy.  See Commonwealth v. Beale,"", ', 1024 n.1 (2001).', 'Here, the only detailed statement in Detective Williams\'s affidavit accompanying the § 2703(d) application for the CSLI reads:  ""The current and recent location of Cassio Vertil is necessary and important to my investigation because other witnesses and obtained phone records indicate that Cassio Vertil has been, and continues to provide aid and support to the indicted Josener Dorisca.""  The statement fails to identify the witnesses and does not identify the requisite basis for assessing their reliability or their veracity.  See Commonwealth v. Burt,', ', 710 (1985) (discussing various kinds of informers and witnesses).  Similarly, the particular ""phone records"" are not identified and Detective Williams did not articulate how those records reveal that Cassio provided aid and support to Dorisca.  Contrast, e.g., Commonwealth v. Lopes,', ', 164-165 (2009).  This conclusory statement is so bereft of the factual details required to establish probable cause that, unlike the situation presented in Augustine, we need not remand the matter to the trial court for further findings.

The affidavit indicated that all the essential steps of a controlled buy were met, with the exception that the CI was not directly observed entering or exiting the building or target apartment.  While the execution of the controlled buy was lacking in this respect, the affidavit stated that the CI was observed walking toward the rear door of the defendant's apartment building, returned a short time later under police surveillance with a quantity of cocaine from the vicinity of the rear exterior door, and informed the officers that they purchased the cocaine from the defendant inside the apartment.  This information was sufficient to allow the magistrate to reasonably infer that the CI entered and purchased drugs in the defendant's apartment.

The jury heard the following evidence.', 'On January 29, 2011, James,', ""the four year old victim, was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital (Children's Hospital) with a severe anal wound as well as extensive bruising over multiple areas of his body.  James was seven years old at the time of trial and he testified that the defendant, a friend of his mother, inflicted the bruises as well as the anal injury by hitting him with a belt."", ""James's mother"", 'first developed a friendship with the defendant in the spring of 2010, shortly after the dissolution of her relationship with James\'s father.  James, then three years old, lived with his mother and his older sister and brother in New Bedford.  For a number of years, the mother had been addicted to ""pills,""', 'but, prior to June of 2010, she was able to keep her life ""in control"" and maintain her job as a hair stylist.', 'Prior to June of 2010, the apartment where the family lived was clean and ""nice.""  James attended day care full time, and his sister attended with him in the afternoon at the end of her school day.  Prior to June of 2010, James and his brother and sister appeared happy, clean, and normal.  James would see his maternal grandmother almost every day and, along with his siblings, would attend family parties and holiday gatherings.', ""After June of 2010, James's extended family saw the mother and James less frequently, and noticed that they attended fewer family events and parties.  James's siblings would sometimes attend family events when the mother and James did not.  Over the course of the summer and fall, on various occasions when family members did see James, some reported noticing bruises on his face.  The cleanliness of the family's apartment deteriorated, and the mother was terminated from her job after being increasingly"", 'Page 93', ""absent and late.  During that time, both the mother and James were at the defendant's home almost every day.  In addition, the mother frequently would leave James alone with the defendant, sometimes for hours or even days."", 'During the summer of 2010, James\'s day care teachers noticed that James began to change.  When he returned from a June vacation in Florida, James was distant and not like his usual self.  When he got in trouble, he would become particularly emotional and start to cry, which had not been the case previously.  The defendant started dropping James off on some days, and at one point told his teacher, ""[I]f he doesn\'t listen, just tell him that you guys can . . . call me.""  At the end of July, his teacher noticed that James began to cling to her ""more than usual.""  Also in July, a teacher noticed an apparent burn mark on James\'s inner thigh.  In August, on one occasion, she noticed scratches on his face.  Later that month, the defendant brought James in with a bruise on his cheek and said, ""I\'m sure he\'ll be perfect for you today.""', ""Also, that month, the mother changed the emergency contacts and the list of individuals permitted to pick up James from day care; she removed all of the other family members who had been on the list, including James's grandmothers and others, leaving only herself and the defendant on the list."", 'James, who had had very good attendance previously, began to be absent frequently in July and August of 2010.  In September, the day care program discharged him because of excessive unexcused absences.', ""In July of 2010, James's maternal grandmother came to visit the mother at work.  The grandmother saw the defendant waiting outside in a car with James in his car seat.  She was happy to see James as she had not seen him for a long time, and she ran to the car.  James looked sad and was very quiet, and not like his normal self.  As the mother came out of her workplace, the defendant told her forcefully to get into the car, ending the encounter."", 'In August of 2010, the mother allowed James\'s paternal grandmother to take him on a vacation to Florida.  During the trip, James complained frequently that his ""bum"" hurt.  He would sit sideways, and would cry when he went to the bathroom.  His grandmother looked at the area and saw a small cut.', 'In mid-October, after James turned four years old, he visited with his maternal grandmother after a family apple-picking trip;', 'Page 94', 'this was the first time that she had seen James since July.  Although James seemed happy, he told her that ""his butt hurt.""  She gave him a bath, and observed that ""his butt was red"" and that he had a short, deep cut in the area.', ""On October 25, 2010, the mother took James to his pediatrician.  The pediatrician observed a rash on James's scrotum, buttocks, and anal area.  He prescribed an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory cream, and a medicine to protect the skin in the area.  At a follow-up appointment on November 9, the doctor noted that there was a small ulcerative lesion around the anus, but that the rash did not seem worse, and had cleared on the buttocks.  At a further follow-up visit three days later, he observed that the area appeared to be improving.  On December 6, James returned to the office, and the doctor observed that the area appeared worse and had ulcers.  He referred James to Children's Hospital the same day."", ""James was admitted to Children's Hospital on December 6, 2010,"", 'where doctors observed an irregularly shaped ulcer under the scrotum, and another ulcer on his anal area.  James underwent various tests and examinations to rule out potential causes of the ulceration.  Doctors ruled out infection but were ultimately unable to determine a cause for his condition.  At the time of his discharge, after a six-day hospitalization, James\'s condition had ""improved somewhat,"" although the ulcers were still present.', ""In late 2010, James's maternal grandmother obtained the assistance of James's second cousin, who is an attorney, in filing a petition for legal guardianship of James.  On January 27, 2011, the petition was allowed after a hearing at which James's father assented to the guardianship and the mother did not appear.  James's maternal grandmother had last seen James in the mother's car two days earlier at his sister's school.  At that point, she noted that James was able to sit without complaining, and that he had no visible injuries."", ""After the cousin obtained guardianship of James on behalf of his maternal grandmother, the cousin was unable to locate either the mother or James until January 29, when the cousin was notified that the mother was in police custody.  The mother refused to disclose James's specific location, but she eventually connected the cousin with Elizabeth Quinn, who was the girl friend"", 'Page 95', 'of the defendant\'s best friend.  The cousin engaged in ""several conversations several minutes at a time"" with Quinn over approximately twenty-five minutes, with male voices in the background of the telephone calls.  Quinn eventually told the cousin to come to an intersection a couple of houses away from the defendant\'s home to receive James.  Quinn directed her to report there with ""no police.""', 'Quinn then retrieved James from the defendant\'s apartment, where James was sleeping on the couch.  She brought him to the agreed-upon street corner and handed him to the cousin, who was accompanied by a State police officer.  James was having a difficult time walking.  He was extremely upset and crying, saying, ""Make it go away,"" and that his ""bum"" hurt.  He could not sit down.  The cousin and the officer brought James to St. Luke\'s Hospital, where, a nurse later testified, ""[h]e appeared afraid to me, he wouldn\'t . . . let me touch him.""  She observed ""multiple bruises to his face, his eyes, a good per cent of his body, his back, his legs, arms.""  She identified photographs of the injuries she observed, including photographs of James\'s rectum, penis, and scrotum.  The photographs were admitted in evidence.  After several hours, hospital staff made a decision to transfer James to Children\'s Hospital.', 'At Children\'s Hospital, examination confirmed that James had extensive bruising and abrasions over multiple areas of his body, including his forehead, cheek, arms, back, waist, buttocks, inner and outer thighs, legs, and shins.  Superimposed on the bruising on James\'s thigh were three curvilinear marks that were suggestive of having been struck by a ""flexible implement that\'s been doubled"" onto itself.  He had a cut under his chin, and blood behind his right eardrum.', 'James also had a very deep anal wound:  a widely split laceration extending from just behind his scrotum to his tailbone.  His anus was completely detached from the skin around it and was ""floating way up inside the buttocks.""  The wound had accumulated filth and fecal debris, and it appeared to be at least a couple of days old but was not infected.  There was no abscess and no evidence of ulceration that could explain the injury.  James ultimately required surgery to reconstruct the area.', ""Dr. Steven Fishman, James's surgeon, opined that James's anal wound was induced externally by blunt force trauma, and that no natural disease process or hygiene issues could have created it.  Dr. Fishman testified that, in over twenty years of experience as"", 'Page 96', 'a pediatric surgeon, he had previously only seen a completely ""floating"" anus as a result of surgery.  Dr. Fishman noted that, because of the tensile strength in the tissues in the area, if there is impact, there is a particular susceptibility to tearing in that spot.  Without successful surgery to reconstruct his anus and perineum, Dr. Fishman testified that James risked having no control over defecation, or being unable to defecate.', 'On January 31, 2011, police officers went to the defendant\'s apartment to search the premises.  They knocked on the door, loudly said ""Police,"" and waited.  No one came to the door.  They knocked and announced themselves several additional times and, receiving no answer, kicked the door in and entered the apartment.  The defendant was in the living room of the apartment at the time they entered.', ""Officers recovered a number of items from the defendant's apartment, including a black belt with a red-brown stain on the buckle found in a white plastic trash bag in one of the apartment's bedrooms.  Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis of the stain revealed a mixture of at least two individuals, with the profile of the major contributor to the sample matching James.  The defendant and the mother were excluded as contributors to the mixture."", 'James testified that he had lived with the defendant along with his mother, who was ""sometimes"" there.  James testified that he did not like spending time with the defendant because the defendant used to put ""salt"" in James\'s ""butt,"" put James in an attic closet, and stuck James\'s head in the toilet.  James testified that the defendant did each of these things more than once.  As to the salt, James testified that it ""looked like salt and it was white,"" and it ""stinged a little bit"" when the defendant used it.  The defendant would bend him over, hold him down, and swirl the salt in a glass cup.', 'James said distinctly that the defendant put the ""salt in my butt,"" rather than on it.', 'The defendant also would hit James ""like everywhere"" with a black belt.  When he was shown images of the bruises on his body, James testified that the defendant had caused them with the belt.', 'Shown an image of his anal wound, James testified that the defendant had caused that wound with the belt as well.', 'Page 97', '2.  Discussion.  a.  Sufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him guilty of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury based on the theory that the defendant caused the injury by striking James with a belt on the buttocks.', ""In particular, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth's medical evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that such a blow -- on the buttocks, as opposed to on the anus or scrotum -- could have caused the injury."", ""He also points to his own expert's testimony in support of his argument."", 'In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was ample evidence for the jury to draw the conclusion that a strike from the belt caused the injury; the judge limited the jury\'s consideration, saying, ""[F]or this particular charge, you must be satisfied that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant touched [James] in the area of his anus, scrotum or buttocks with a belt and/or by spreading his buttock cheeks.  No other alleged touching is within the scope of this indictment.""  James testified at trial that the defendant caused the anal wound by hitting him with a belt.  In addition to other circumstantial evidence, James\'s testimony was corroborated both by that of Dr. Fishman, who opined that blunt force trauma caused the wound, and by evidence of James\'s blood on a belt found in the defendant\'s home in a plastic bag.  Expert testimony proffered by the defendant, to the effect that a blow to the buttocks would not have caused the wound because the buttocks would have protected the perineal area, did not cause the Commonwealth\'s case to deteriorate, as the jurors were entitled to discredit that testimony.  See Commonwealth v. Bush,', "", 137 (2008).  We are satisfied that the judge's instructions fairly explained the charge to the jury; if there was any error in including a reference to the buttocks in the charge or on the verdict slip, the defendant did not object and we see no risk of a miscarriage of justice."", 'The defendant also argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty on the charge of reckless endangerment', 'Page 98', 'of a child, because the Commonwealth did not provide evidence that ""the injuries the Commonwealth included as conduct under this theory created the risk of additional injury.""  The defendant\'s argument appears to be premised on the mistaken belief that G. L. c. 265, § 13L, requires that the defendant\'s actions in creating the risk of injury not result in actual injury.  This is not an element of the offense.  A risk of injury may ""come to fruition in the form of an actual injury.""  Commonwealth v. Roderiques,', "", 423 (2012) (defendant properly convicted of reckless endangerment of child where infant had fractures of arm, legs, ribs, spine, and clavicle).  Although actual injury is not required to satisfy the statute, it is not necessary that injury be absent.  Here, the jury could have properly found that the defendant's conduct in causing James's injuries created substantial risk of serious bodily injury.  There was no error."", 'b.  Jury instructions.  The defendant argues that it was improper for the judge to define bodily injury in the course of his instruction on the offense of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury.', ',', 'The defendant did not object to the instruction at trial and, for that reason, ""the claims he now raises', 'Page 99', 'on appeal are not preserved.  See Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b),  378 Mass. 895  (1979).  We therefore review to determine whether an error occurred and, if so, whether that error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.""  Commonwealth v. Arias,', ', 464 (2013).', '""A trial judge is obligated to instruct the jury on all aspects of pertinent law applicable to issues raised in the case so that the [jurors] understand[] the basis for their verdicts.""  Commonwealth v. Allen,', ', 724 (2002).  It is proper for a judge to define technical terms in jury instructions.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Fuller,', ', 411 (1995) (judge has discretion to define ""mental disease or defect"").  As noted, the statute, G. L. c. 265, § 13J (a), defines a substantial bodily injury as a ""bodily injury which creates a permanent disfigurement, protracted loss or impairment of a function of a body member, limb or organ, or substantial risk of death.""  As ""bodily injury"" is a part of the definition of substantial bodily injury in the statute, the judge here acted properly in defining it.  Her definition closely tracked the definition recited in the statute, and the defendant does not contest its accuracy.  There was no error.', '', ""c.  Closing argument.  The defendant claims that the prosecutor's closing argument was improper in several respects.  While the Commonwealth concedes some errors in the prosecutor's summation, it argues that any misstatements were minor, and therefore do not warrant reversal.  As the defendant did not object"", 'Page 100', 'at trial, we review the nine alleged errors individually to determine whether they were error and, if so, whether they created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  Commonwealth v. Jones,', ', 148 (2015).  ""Remarks made during closing arguments are considered in context of the whole argument, the evidence admitted at trial, and the judge\'s instructions to the jury.""  Commonwealth v. Andrade,', ', 552 (2014), quoting Commonwealth v. Whitman,', ', 343 (2009).  We also note that the judge told the jury that the opening statements and the closing arguments of counsel were not evidence, both before the arguments and again during her final instructions to the jury.', 'First, the defendant challenges the prosecutor\'s statement that the defendant and James\'s mother met in May of 2010.  The Commonwealth concedes that this was a misstatement.  The defendant is correct that no witness testified that the defendant and the mother first met in May of 2010.  A friend of the defendant testified that the mother and the defendant spent time together in late 2009, and the defendant testified that he ""knew of"" the mother at the end of 2009.  James\'s family members testified to meeting the defendant in May of 2010, or ""late spring, early summer"" of 2010.  To the extent that the prosecutor\'s comment that the two met in May of 2010 constituted a misstatement, it was not a significant one.  The defendant testified that he and the mother began to develop a friendship in May of 2010.  That testimony supported with equal force the Commonwealth\'s argument that the relationship between the two coincided with a deterioration of the mother\'s parenting of James and with injuries and changes of behavior in James.', 'Second, the defendant challenges the prosecutor\'s statement that it took twenty minutes for Quinn and the defendant to ""finally give up the child"" after the arrival of James\'s cousin and the State trooper at the arranged meeting place; the cousin\'s testimony in fact was that it took two or three minutes after their arrival before Quinn arrived with James.  The Commonwealth concedes that this also was a misstatement.  As it points out, however, the cousin\'s testimony was that there were about twenty-five minutes of ""back and forth"" telephone calls with Quinn before arrangements were finally made to give James to her.  Those arrangements included Quinn\'s demand that there be no police present at the transfer.  Because there was ample evidence of the difficulty the cousin experienced in securing James, any prejudice arising from that misstatement was also minimal.', 'Page 101', 'Third, the defendant claims that there was no basis for the prosecutor to argue that, on January 29, 2011, the defendant ""knew"" that police would be coming to his home.  Here, given James\'s extensive injuries at the time the defendant relinquished him from his custody, as well as the contentious circumstances of the transfer of custody, the jury reasonably could infer that the defendant would expect police contact shortly after James\'s injuries were discovered.  A prosecutor may ""zealously argue in favor of those inferences favorable to his or her case.""  Commonwealth v. Rakes,', ', 45 (2017).  ""The inferences for which counsel argues need not be necessary, or inescapable; they only need be reasonable and possible.""  Id.  We see no error in this portion of the prosecutor\'s argument.', 'Also, given this context, and contrary to the defendant\'s argument, the judge did not err in giving a careful consciousness of guilt instruction based on testimony that the defendant ""did not answer the door in response to repeated knocking by police.""  Commonwealth v. Bruneau,', ', 519 (2015).  The judge warned the jury, ""You are not required to draw such an inference and must use great care and caution before you draw an inference of guilt from such evidence. . . .  [Y]ou should always remember that there may be numerous reasons why an innocent person might do such things.""  It was the province of the jury to evaluate the credibility of the defendant\'s alternative explanation for his delay.  See Commonwealth v. Morris,', ', 738-739 (2013).', 'Fourth, the defendant claims that the prosecutor mischaracterized his testimony by stating that he had claimed that, while he cleaned or attempted to medicate James\'s anal area, James was ""screaming and writhing in pain,"" and yet he did not see James\'s injury.  The defendant claims further that the prosecutor improperly stated that he testified that he put ointment on the injured area only once.', 'In fact, the defendant testified that he poured a mixture of warm water and ""Epson [sic] salt"" onto James\'s buttocks, that it ""hurt [James] a lot,"" and that James ""cr[ied],"" ""yelled,"" and ""screamed.""', 'He testified that, afterwards, he rinsed the area with plain water', 'Page 102', ""and put cream on it.  He said that he cleaned James in that manner only one time, and otherwise only used wipes to clean the area directly.  He testified that, when he was cleaning James in this way, he only saw James's scrotum area and not any of the anal wound, which would require spreading the cheeks of the buttocks to observe.  Because the defendant's testimony supported the prosecutor's statements, there was no error."", ""Fifth, the defendant claims that the prosecutor made several misrepresentations about the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Laposata, the defendant's medical expert.  First, he argues that the prosecutor falsely stated that Dr. Celeste Wilson"", 'and Dr. Laposata both had opined that the wounds on the child were inflicted.  In context, it would have been evident to the jury that this statement was a mere slip of the tongue, and that the prosecutor had intended to refer to the two medical experts called by the Commonwealth:  Dr. Wilson and Dr. Fishman.  This error did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  See Commonwealth v. Thomas,', ', 683 (1987) (no reversal for prosecutor\'s ""slip of the tongue"" where judge instructed jury that closing arguments are not evidence).', 'Sixth, the defendant argues that the prosecutor wrongly stated that Dr. Laposata ""could not give [the jury] an explanation at all"" for the mechanism of James\'s injury, that she blamed the purported escalation of James\'s injury over time on moisture, and that she opined that the injury was caused by James sitting on a ""doggie pee pad.""  In context, the prosecutor\'s claim that Dr. Laposata could not give the jury an explanation for the injury was in effect an argument that the doctor could offer no credible explanation for the injury.  That statement ""falls into the category of \'enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole,\' and is not grounds for reversal.""  Commonwealth v. Silva,', ', 515 (2009), quoting Commonwealth v. Wilson,', ', 350 (1998).', ""Dr. Laposata did testify that moisture could contribute to the body's failure to heal an ulcer, and that an ulcer could be worsened by exposure to urine.  The prosecutor's reference to that testimony therefore was proper.  As to the statement about a dog pad, the prosecutor's remark in context is not wholly clear, but it"", 'Page 103', 'appears that she intended to attribute this claim not to Dr. Laposata specifically, but to the defense more generally.  The defendant elicited evidence of such pads being around James\'s mother\'s home, and introduced James\'s statement, admitted only for impeachment, that ""he sat on a doggy\'s pee pee pad and his bum hurt[].""  This section of the prosecutor\'s argument was inartful, but it was relatively brief.  To the extent that it constituted error, we see no prejudice.', 'Seventh, the defendant claims that the prosecutor introduced her personal beliefs into her closing argument, citing two statements.  He first challenges the statement, ""You honestly don\'t believe, I don\'t, that that night . . . there was no conversation between [Quinn] and the defendant.  I submit to you, of course there was.""  The Commonwealth concedes that the remark ""I don\'t"" was ""inappropriate.""', '""A prosecutor may not express [her] personal belief in the testimony or suggest that [she] has knowledge independent of the evidence at trial.""  Commonwealth v. Sanders,', ', 296-297 (2008).  Although we agree that the phrase ""I don\'t"" was inappropriate, it was immediately followed by the proper wording, ""I submit to you.""  ""The prosecutor was entitled to argue, as [she] was doing, that the jury should not arrive at particular interpretations of the evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Hogan,', ', 408 (1978).  In any event, the challenged remark was brief and unobtrusive, and it related to a tangential matter in the case.  We note that such ""[m]ere[] unfortunate and unartful isolated"" remarks ""are generally not enough to lead the jury to improper inferences drawn from presumed personal knowledge of the prosecutor.""  Commonwealth v. Raymond,', ', 391-392 (1997), quoting Commonwealth v. Thomas,', ', 115 (1987).  ""The absence of objection from defense counsel further convinces us that taken in the context, the remark would not likely have misled the jury or prejudiced [the defendant].""  Raymond, supra at 392.', 'Eighth, the defendant also challenges the prosecutor\'s sarcastic statement, ""That really is a valid argument,"" as improper vouching.  The statement at issue was made in the context of the prosecutor\'s argument that mere familial disputes did not fully explain James\'s mother\'s removal of family members from James\'s day care access list.  The challenged remark was, in fact, a criticism of a defense argument rather than any intimation of personal knowledge.  Though often better avoided, sarcasm is permitted', 'Page 104', 'in closing arguments.  See Commonwealth v. Brum,', ', 119 (2002).  There was no error.', 'Finally, the defendant challenges the prosecutor\'s characterization of the defendant as ""a drug user"" and his friends as ""all drug users.""  The characterization was brief, not inflammatory, and based on the evidence.  The defendant testified regarding his own drug use and that of his friends.  He referred to this testimony during his own closing argument.  The statement was proper.', 'd.  Duplicative convictions.  For the first time in his reply brief, the defendant claims that his convictions of assault and battery on a child with substantial bodily injury and reckless endangerment of a child are duplicative.', '""We need not pass on grounds for reversal raised for the first time in a reply brief.""  Commonwealth v. McGowan,', "", 390 n.4 (1987).  Nonetheless, the defendant's argument is unavailing, because the two crimes have separate elements."", 'A defendant ""may properly be punished for two crimes arising out of the same course of conduct.""  Commonwealth v. Torres,', ', 288-289 (2014), quoting Commonwealth v. Valliere,', ', 371 (2002).  ""A lesser included offense is one which is necessarily accomplished on commission of the greater crime.""  Commonwealth v. D\'Amour,', ', 748 (1999).  ""As long as each offense requires proof of an additional element that the other does not, \'neither crime is a lesser-included offense of the other, and convictions on both are deemed to have been authorized by the Legislature and hence not [duplicative].\'""  Commonwealth v. Vick,', ', 431 (2009), quoting Commonwealth v. Jones,', ', 393 (1981).  In this analysis, ""[t]he actual criminal acts alleged are wholly irrelevant to the application of [the rule]; rather, the elements of the crimes charged are considered objectively, abstracted from the facts. . . .""  Commonwealth v. Jones,', ', 76 (2004), quoting Commonwealth v. Jones,', ', 162 (2003).', 'We turn now to the statutes at issue in the case at bar.  General Laws c. 265, § 13J (b), second par., in relevant part, provides, ""Whoever commits an assault and battery upon a child and by such assault and battery causes substantial bodily injury shall be punished.""  General Laws c. 265, § 13L, in relevant part, provides, ""Whoever wantonly or recklessly engages in conduct that creates', 'Page 105', 'a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or sexual abuse to a child . . . shall be punished.""  For purposes of § 13L, the statute specifies that wanton or reckless behavior occurs only where a defendant ""is aware of and consciously disregards"" the risk at issue.  Id.  The risk must be ""of such nature and degree that disregard of the risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.""  Id.', 'Comparing the elements of the two offenses reveals that each offense requires an element that the other does not.  Section 13J (b), second par., requires both a touching and an injury, where § 13L requires only conduct that creates substantial risk of injury.  Section 13L requires proof of a ""defendant\'s subjective state of mind with respect to the risk involved.

The abused party would have no ability to lessen the abusive party\'s prerogative to initiate contact and could expect no refuge from the possibility of further abuse.  That the Legislature intended the word \'vacate\' to include the concept of \'remain away\' is demonstrated by the authority of a judge to issue a \'vacate\' order for a period of one year.  G.

The CI said that Bryan sometimes arrived at the purchase location in a gold-colored vehicle with a strap holding down the trunk, which was driven by a woman.', ""After consulting with other members of the narcotics investigation unit, Detective Amaral learned that another detective in that unit (Detective Sergeant Marc Blouin) had begun an investigation of an individual named Bryan Simpson residing at 175 Harwich Street, New Bedford, and had received five anonymous telephone calls on the narcotics anonymous tips line within the previous six months.  The anonymous tipster described Simpson's use of a gold-colored vehicle with a strap holding down the trunk.  Blouin informed Amaral that he had traveled to 175 Harwich Street and observed Simpson and a woman leave the building at that address and get into a gold-colored vehicle with a strap holding down the trunk.  After checking the license plate of the vehicle, Blouin learned that it was registered to the defendant's mother.  After searching police department records, Amaral discovered"", 'Page 272', 'an incident report concerning a domestic disturbance at 175 Harwich Street between Simpson and the defendant on July 7, 2013, in which the defendant reported that she had had a verbal argument with Simpson, whom she described as her boy friend of four years.', '', 'Amaral then arranged, on three separate occasions between May 4 and May 23, 2014, to have the CI participate in controlled purchases of crack cocaine from Simpson.  On two occasions, shortly after the CI placed a call to Bryan, detectives watched Simpson and a woman leave by the front door of 175 Harwich Street, enter a vehicle parked on the street, and drive directly to the designated location.  There, the CI briefly interacted with Simpson before the two separated.  After both encounters, the CI provided police with a substance that was later confirmed to be crack cocaine.  After the second meeting, Simpson and the woman returned immediately to 175 Harwich Street and entered through the front door.  On the occasion of the third controlled purchase, Simpson was observed leaving 175 Harwich Road alone, entering a vehicle in the rear of the building, and driving to the designated location, where he sold crack cocaine to the CI and then drove in a direction away from Harwich Road.  On at least two other occasions during this period, police observed Simpson leave his residence and engage briefly with individuals other than the CI at various locations in what appeared to be drug transactions.', 'Detectives also observed Simpson and a woman check the mailbox for an apartment on the east side of 175 Harwich Street before using keys to enter through the front door of the building.', 'Amaral next determined that the utilities for the third-floor apartment on the east side of 175 Harwich Street had been established in the name of Michelle Silva on September 17, 2012, listing a particular telephone number for the customer.

The factual recitation that follows is drawn from the judge's findings."", '', 'Background.  1.  The tip provided to police.  The Boston police focused on the defendant\'s vehicle because of a tip they had received from an undisclosed source.  Specifically, on or before June 9, 2014, the police received information that a green Volvo station wagon containing a ""large"" amount of drugs would be near a certain intersection in the Roxbury section of Boston.  No other information regarding the tip was provided at the evidentiary hearing.', ""Thus, for example, there was no evidence that the tipster provided the license plate number of the vehicle, what time it would arrive, or any information whatsoever about the vehicle's occupants, if any.  Similarly, there was no evidence about who the tipster was, how he or she purportedly came into possession of the alleged information, how that information was passed along to police, or whether the police had any reason to trust it."", 'It was not happenstance that so little evidence was presented about the tip, and none about the tipster.  At the beginning of the evidentiary hearing, the prosecutor made it clear that she did not intend to go into such issues because she did not want to risk', 'Page 339', 'identifying the informant.', 'Thus, in an effort to head off any inquiry into the tip, the prosecutor expressly disavowed trying to establish the tip\'s reliability pursuant to applicable case law, and she made it clear that she would be ""objecting to any sort of [cross-examination] questions regarding the . . . source of that information that the police had.""  Defense counsel responded that he was content with this arrangement based on his understanding of how the informant\'s alleged information would be treated.  Specifically, he stated as follows:  ""It\'s a statement for context only that\'s not being used because it doesn\'t satisfy [the standard set forth in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969)].  For those purposes, I\'ve agreed to not go into the -- who the source is, how is it that it came about, what were the exact details of the tip because we\'re [sic] not using it under Aguilar-Spinelli to suppor[t] the stop or search.""  The judge responded by stating, ""Okay.  Fair enough.""  The prosecutor made no effort to disabuse defense counsel of his understanding.', '2.  Police observations.  Upon receiving the tip, four police officers set up surveillance at the intersection mentioned by the informant.  At about 5:15 p.m. on June 9, 2014, they saw a green Volvo station wagon turn at the intersection without the driver using his turn signal.  The vehicle then parked approximately fifty feet away.  Shortly thereafter, one of the officers observed the vehicle\'s operator, subsequently identified as the defendant, lean down toward his right side ""as if he [were] reaching toward the floor of the passenger side with both hands.""  According to the judge\'s findings, the officer could not see the defendant\'s hands or what the defendant might have been doing with them.  Observing from a distance, the officers saw a man approach the parked vehicle from an adjacent building and interact with the defendant at the driver\'s side window for approximately half a minute.  While the judge found that the police observed the unidentified man who had approached the defendant\'s vehicle lean toward it ""in a manner consistent with that man placing his hands on the Volvo door or reaching inside the Volvo,"" he also found that the police did not observe the defendant and the unidentified man actually ""reach their hands toward each other, bring their hands', 'Page 340', 'together, or exchange any object.""  Furthermore, the judge found that the police did not see anything in the pedestrian\'s hands as he was walking away from the vehicle, nor did they see him put anything into his pocket, or move his arm in a manner suggesting that he had just put anything there.  Despite the absence of any observation of an item being exchanged between the men, the judge found that their interaction was ""consistent with the two men exchanging something.""', ""After the man walked away, the defendant drove his vehicle to an adjacent street, where the police pulled his vehicle over.  Although the defendant appeared nervous, he produced his driver's license and vehicle registration when requested to do so.  At this point, there were at least four officers at the scene, and one of them ordered the defendant out of the vehicle.  As the defendant was stepping out of the vehicle, the officer saw a roll of cash in a clear plastic bag on the inside of the driver's door.  After further questioning of the defendant proved fruitless"", 'and a patfrisk of him revealed nothing, the police initiated a thorough search of the vehicle, subsequently aided by a drug-sniffing dog.  They eventually uncovered a metal box underneath the passenger seat, inside of which was a large amount of cocaine and additional cash.', 'The defendant moved to suppress all the evidence the police collected pursuant to the stop and search of his vehicle, including the cocaine, its packaging, the money (which totaled $11,050), the defendant\'s cellular telephones, and a magnet that police believed was used to access a ""hide"" inside the vehicle.  The judge ruled in the Commonwealth\'s favor.  In doing so, he did not rely on the informant\'s tip in any fashion.  In fact, with regard to that tip, the judge found that ""[t]he Commonwealth did not present any evidence to demonstrate the basis for the informant\'s knowledge, that the police had any reason to believe that the informant was truthful, or that the police had corroborated the source\'s information that the [defendant\'s vehicle] would contain illegal drugs.""  Instead, the judge concluded that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle and to order the defendant out of it based on the brief interaction that the police had observed between the defendant and the unidentified man who had approached his vehicle.  Then, according to the judge, once the police observed the wad of bills in the driver\'s door while the exit', 'Page 341', 'order was being executed, they gained probable cause that justified their subsequent search of the vehicle.', ""Discussion.  1.  Introduction.  The dispute before us is relatively narrow.  It is uncontested that the police found the cocaine and other incriminating evidence during an investigatory search of the defendant's vehicle.  It follows that this search was valid only if the Commonwealth at that point had probable cause to conduct the search.  Commonwealth v. Eggleston,"", ', 557 (2009).', ""Moreover, the Commonwealth acknowledges that its claim that it had probable cause depends on the police having observed the roll of bills in the door of the vehicle while they were executing the exit order.  Therefore, if the exit order was not valid, the Commonwealth's claim that it had probable cause to search the vehicle falls short."", 'While the police could have stopped the vehicle for the civil traffic violation they observed,', 'this would not have justified the exit order that led to the discovery of the roll of bills.', ""Rather, in the particular circumstances of this case, the validity of the exit order -- and hence the Commonwealth's claim that it obtained probable cause once it found the wad of bills  -- depends on the police having gained reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in illegal drug activity.  See Commonwealth v. Bostock,"", ', 621-622 (2008) (exit order justified when police have reasonable suspicion that operator engaged in criminal activity).  The key question, then, is whether, by the time the police ordered the defendant out of his vehicle, they had ""reasonable suspicion, based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom, that an occupant of the . . . motor vehicle', 'Page 342', 'had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Anderson,', ', 621, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 946 (2012), quoting Commonwealth v. Alvarado,', ', 268 (1996).  We turn to that question and begin by examining the grounds on which the judge relied.', ""2.  Reasonable suspicion.  a.  Police observations.  The motion judge found, without referring to the tip, that the police had reasonable suspicion to believe the defendant was selling illegal drugs based on the defendant's brief interaction with the unidentified pedestrian (after the defendant stopped his vehicle on a public street and reached toward the floor of the vehicle).  We disagree."", 'As noted, the police did not observe any item being exchanged between the defendant and the person who approached and leaned toward his vehicle.  As the Commonwealth highlights, testimony of an observed hand-to-hand exchange in some circumstances can establish the requisite degree of suspicion that an illegal narcotics sale has occurred even where the police do not ""actually see an object exchanged.""  Commonwealth v. Kennedy,', ', 710 (1998).', 'However, in those narcotics sale cases in which reasonable suspicion has been found in the absence of police observing an item being exchanged, there were significantly more suspicious circumstances than those encountered here.  For example, in Commonwealth v. Stewart,', ', 261 (2014), the court found reasonable suspicion for police to stop the defendant where -- knowing that he previously had been arrested for drug dealing -- they observed that ""three persons followed [him] down a narrow street often used by drug users, with [a] woman counting currency as she walked, and then all four huddled briefly together in a doorway, before they dispersed.""  See Commonwealth v. Gomes,', ', 511-512 (2009); Commonwealth v. Moses,', ', 140 (1990).', '', 'Page 343', 'Here, as a police witness acknowledged, neither the defendant nor the putative buyer was known to the police.', 'Furthermore, the judge found that the police had no reason, based on past experience, to expect a drug transaction to occur in this particular area, which was made up of ""relatively quiet residential streets.""', 'All the police observed was an unknown driver stop his vehicle in a residential neighborhood, lean down toward the passenger-side floor, and subsequently have a brief interaction with an unknown pedestrian during which the pedestrian leaned toward the vehicle (as if to place his hands on or in it).  As far as it goes, the judge\'s finding that what the police saw was ""consistent with"" a hand-to-hand exchange of illegal drugs is unassailable.  However, the defendant\'s observed actions would also be ""consistent with"" a broad range of other interactions.  These would include, as', 'Page 344', 'mere examples, the driver\'s saying a quick hello to an acquaintance he passed on the street, the driver\'s asking for directions after looking for a map, or the driver\'s stopping to drop off tickets to a sporting event or another item to a friend he had arranged to meet.  Even if there were sufficient evidence to establish reasonable suspicion that an exchange had taken place, there was not enough to establish that the exchange was of illegal drugs.  Put otherwise, if the looming presence of the unsubstantiated tip is truly disregarded, then the specific actions that the police observed -- even when seen through the eyes of experienced officers -- created at most a ""hunch"" that a drug transaction had just occurred.  As the Supreme Judicial Court has long held, a ""mere \'hunch\' is not enough"" to establish reasonable suspicion.  Commonwealth v. Silva,', ', 406 (1974).', '', ""The Commonwealth seeks to justify the stop by having us add to the mix the undisclosed informant's tip about a green Volvo station wagon containing drugs."", 'Although the judge himself placed no reliance on the tip, it is plain from one of the arresting officer\'s testimony that, unsurprisingly, such information played a major part in leading him ""to believe that a possible drug transaction [had] occurred.""  Because we can affirm the denial of the motion to suppress on any ground fairly supported by the record, see Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe,', ', 102 (1997), we must evaluate whether considering the tip here makes a difference.', ""b.  The import of the tip.  The Supreme Judicial Court has made it clear that the Commonwealth cannot rely on an informant's tip unless the reliability of that tip has been demonstrated pursuant to the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli test (in which courts are to assess the extent to which the informant's veracity and basis of knowledge have been shown).  See Commonwealth v. Upton,"", 'Page 345', '', ', 375 (1985), citing Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969).  In continuing to adhere to the Aguilar-Spinelli test in the context of challenges brought pursuant to art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the court on multiple occasions has rejected calls that it adopt the less demanding ""totality of the circumstances"" test employed by the United States Supreme Court in challenges brought pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See Upton, 394 Mass. at 371-375 (rejecting the rule adopted in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 [1983]).  See also Commonwealth v. Lyons,', ', 18 (1990) (declining to follow the rule stated in Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 328 [1990]); Commonwealth v. Mubdi,', ', 395-396 (2010).', 'In its brief, the Commonwealth appears to maintain that where, as here, the tip is not the sole basis for the police action, the Aguilar-Spinelli test does not apply.  Rather, the Commonwealth seems to suggest, the information received from the informant can be considered as one factor among others that collectively tip the scales.  In this manner, the Commonwealth effectively advocates for a ""totality of the circumstances"" test that the Supreme Judicial Court has time and again rejected.  Under existing case law, if the requisite level of suspicion depends on an informant\'s tip, that tip must satisfy Aguilar-Spinelli.', 'Here, nothing in the record establishes the informant\'s basis of knowledge or his or her veracity.  Indeed, although the Commonwealth refers to the information the undisclosed informant provided as an ""anonymous tip,"" this actually overstates its force.  An anonymous tip -- such as one made by an unidentified caller to 911 -- typically includes some information that is helpful to assessing the caller\'s basis of knowledge or reliability.  See Commonwealth v. Depiero,', ', 452-453 (2016) (anonymous 911 caller reported seeing drunk driving in Cambridge, with the vehicle ""swerving all over the road"").  The Commonwealth not only failed to make any evidentiary showing with regard to these issues, but also expressly foreswore attempting to do so when the evidentiary hearing began.', '', 'That said, the cases have long recognized that while the', 'Page 346', 'Commonwealth will need to demonstrate a tip\'s reliability based on ""the informant\'s reliability and his or her basis of knowledge[, i]ndependent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors.""  Commonwealth v. Lyons, supra at 19.  Thus, while the Aguilar-Spinelli test must be satisfied, there is more than one way of doing so.  Moreover, in the context of reasonable suspicion, the demonstrated reliability of an informant\'s tip need not be as robust as what is needed to demonstrate probable cause.  Lyons, supra.  The question then is whether the observations the police made at the scene provided sufficient corroboration of the tip to establish its reliability for purposes of assessing reasonable suspicion.', 'At most, the police observations corroborated the unexceptional fact that at some undisclosed point in time, a green Volvo station wagon would be in the identified neighborhood.', 'As the Supreme Judicial Court recently observed, ""Corroboration of purely innocent details that are observable by any bystander, such as the description of a vehicle and its location, provides only limited enhancement to the reasonable suspicion determination.""  Commonwealth v. Pinto,', ', 365 (2017).  To the extent the Commonwealth argues that the brief curbside interaction between the defendant and the unidentified pedestrian corroborated the tip that there were drugs inside of a green Volvo station wagon, we are unpersuaded.', ""See Commonwealth v. Mubdi, 456 Mass. at 387, 398-399  (fact that a person was observed interacting with defendant and other occupant of defendant's vehicle and started to walk away from the vehicle after seeing approaching police officers held insufficient to corroborate informant's tip about a purportedly illegal sale of a firearm).  Compare Commonwealth"", 'Page 347', 'v. Dasilva,', ', 560 (2006) (anonymous tip that defendant illegally possessed a firearm was corroborated by police observations that, ""[a]fter looking directly at the marked police cruiser, the defendant moved his right hand toward his waistband, fled up the stairs of the building where he was standing, and continued to flee even after [a police officer] ordered him to stop"").  Without a sufficient showing that the informant\'s tip should be considered reliable, it cannot be relied upon to demonstrate reasonable suspicion.', '', 'Conclusion.  The judge was correct not to rely on the informant\'s tip.  However, without such reliance, his ruling that the police had reasonable suspicion to order the defendant out of his vehicle cannot stand.  In turn, without a valid exit order, the police cannot rely on their discovery of the wad of money in the driver\'s door, and the police therefore lacked probable cause to search his vehicle.  ""Because the evidence in issue was traceable to . . . the illegal order[] that the defendant[] leave the car, it must in these circumstances be suppressed as the \'fruit of the poisonous tree.\'""  Commonwealth v. Loughlin,', "", 63 (1982).  The order denying the defendant's motion to suppress is reversed."", 'So ordered.', '', ""I agree with much of the majority's thoughtful decision.  Respectfully, however, I dissent on the crucial issue -- whether, at the time that the officers told the defendant to get out of the vehicle, they had a reasonable suspicion to believe that he had engaged in an illegal drug transaction.  The stop itself clearly was justified by the earlier traffic violation, a conclusion that the defendant does not really dispute.  The motion"", 'Page 348', 'judge explicitly credited the officers\' testimony ""that [the defendant] made [a] turn [from Copeland Street through the intersection at Warren Street and onto Waverly Street] without using any turn signal.""', '', 'Background.  As the majority notes, the judge\'s findings were careful and thorough.  First, he found that, at the time of the encounter, the two lead officers, Fabiano and Gero, ""were both experienced narcotics investigators.""  They were assisted by officers from the District B-2 anti-crime unit.  ""That afternoon they were looking to intercept and stop a green Volvo station wagon because an unidentified informant had told Fabiano that he could find such a vehicle in the area of Waverly and Copeland Streets in Boston and that the vehicle would contain a large amount of illegal narcotics.""', 'When the officers stopped the defendant driving a green Volvo station wagon, they knew:  first, the defendant had stopped his vehicle on Waverly Street, in front of the first building on the left, ""a residential building.""  Second, ""a second man immediately left the nearest building and walked to the driver\'s door of [the defendant\'s] vehicle[.  A]s the second man approached[, the defendant] leaned down to his right as if he were reaching toward the floor by the front passenger seat,"" using both hands.  Third, the defendant then sat back up and interacted for no more than thirty seconds with the second man, who stood immediately outside the driver\'s door of the defendant\'s vehicle.  During this interaction, the second man leaned toward the vehicle as if he were placing his hands on the vehicle\'s door or reaching into the vehicle; he ""was moving one or both of his arms while he was standing next to the Volvo and facing [the defendant], in a manner consistent with the two men exchanging something.""  Fourth, after approximately thirty seconds, the defendant drove away and the second man walked back into the building he had emerged from a moment earlier.  The motion judge found that, ""[b]ased on their training and experience with hand-to-hand drug transactions, [the officers] both suspected that the pedestrian had purchased some kind of illegal drugs from [the defendant].""', 'At the time that the officers ordered the defendant out of the vehicle, they had some additional information.  They had asked', 'Page 349', 'for his license and registration, noting that the defendant ""seemed to be nervous . . . [and] that [he] seemed to be breathing heavily, was looking in his rear view and side view mirrors at the various police officers and vehicles that had pulled up behind him, and was not making eye contact"" with either of the officers who were speaking with him.  Finally, while the judge declined to use the talismanic words ""high crime area"" and, in fact, specifically found that, as of this date, ""the Boston police had no reason based on past experience to expect to see a drug transaction take place on Waverly Street or Copeland Street, which are both relatively quiet residential streets,"" he also ""credit[ed] Of[ficer] Gero\'s testimony that over the years he ha[d] made numerous arrests for possession or distribution of illegal narcotics in this general neighborhood.""', '', 'Discussion.  1.

The RMV records also indicated, in the words of the affidavit, that the registration of the Acura was ""currently revoked for insurance.""', 'Page 698', 'The affidavit recited further information linking the defendant to the Acura.  Specifically, a few years earlier, a college campus police officer had ""queried Massachusetts registration 439RG2"" (which differed from the Acura\'s current registration number) and found that it corresponded to an Acura Integra registered to the defendant.  That query came to the attention of the defendant\'s Federal probation officer, who asked him about it in 2013; the defendant stated that he had purchased a 1996 Acura Integra.  Also, a Brockton police report, apparently from 2013,', 'described officers as having responded to a domestic violence incident and arrested the defendant in a ""little red car"" at the Main Street address.', 'Trooper Connolly\'s affidavit expressed his opinion that the defendant owned the Acura but had registered it under a family member\'s name ""to avoid law enforcement detection.""  Trooper Connolly was aware that the defendant had a lengthy record of drug and other charges, including a 2005 Federal drug conviction for which he received a substantial committed sentence.  Trooper Connolly himself had arrested the defendant in 2011 for possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute.', ""Further investigation disclosed that the defendant's father lived at the Main Street address and that a 2011 Brockton police report described the defendant as having assaulted his female cousin at that address.  Also, neither the defendant, nor anyone else living at the address, nor the registered owner of the Acura (Ms. Santos), possessed a license to carry a firearm or a firearm identification card."", 'The affidavit described the parking lot behind the address as bordering on a street that was ""considered a very high crime area"" -- ""the scene of murders, shots fired, and narcotics dealing.""  The area was difficult to surveil because individuals frequently congregated on the street.  When Trooper Connolly and fellow officers had attempted to surveil the area as part of the current investigation, persons on the street were ""immediately aware of"" the officers\' presence.', 'Based on this information, a search warrant for the Acura issued.  When officers went to the parking lot to execute the warrant, they saw the defendant standing nearby; in his possession was a car key that fit the Acura.  In its trunk, officers found', 'Page 699', ""a revolver, along with mail bearing the defendant's name.  A jury found the defendant guilty of unlawfully possessing the revolver.  This appeal ensued."", ""Discussion.  We review the four corners of the affidavit to determine whether it established probable cause to support the search warrant.  See Commonwealth v. O'Day,"", ', 297-298 (2003).  When an affidavit is based on a tip from a confidential informant, we examine whether the affidavit met the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli', ""test, by establishing both the informant's basis of knowledge and her veracity (i.e., that she was credible or her information reliable).

Id. at 376.', ""Here, the affidavit made clear that the basis of CI#1's knowledge was CI#1's personal observations.  See, e.g., Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 374-375 (detailed personal observations establish basis of knowledge).  The defendant thus challenges only whether the affidavit sufficiently established CI#1's veracity.  We conclude that it did."", 'The defendant first argues that police knowledge of CI#1\'s ""true identity"" was insufficient to establish that the police could hold CI#1 accountable for providing false information, and thus it did nothing to support CI#1\'s veracity.  We disagree.  Knowledge of an informant\'s identity alone has been held to contribute to his veracity.  See Commonwealth v. Cruz,', ', 30 (2001), citing Commonwealth v. Bakoian,', ', 301 (1992).  Cf. Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 375-376 (that police knew confidential informant\'s whereabouts as well as identity, making informant reachable, weighed in favor of his reliability).  Moreover, when the affidavit here is ""taken as a whole and read in a commonsense fashion,"" Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 375, it indicates that the police were able to contact CI#1.  The affidavit suggests that CI#1\'s tip caused the police to focus on the Acura, that they then surveilled the area and obtained a photograph of the Acura in the parking lot, and that CI#1 confirmed that the photograph depicted the vehicle in which the defendant placed the', 'Page 700', 'firearm.', ""We read this as indicating that after receiving CI#1's tip, the police obtained the photograph, and then were able to locate CI#1 to show it to CI#1."", 'The defendant next argues that CI#1\'s 2008 tip regarding the shotgun did not support CI#1\'s veracity because the affidavit did not indicate that the shotgun was illegally possessed or that its discovery led to an arrest or conviction.  Cf. Byfield, 413 Mass. at 431 (informant\'s veracity established by prior tip leading to arrest and conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute).  Again, we disagree.  The affidavit stated that the 2008 tip furnished ""accurate information regarding the', 'of an illegally possessed loaded 12 gauge shotgun that was concealed in Brockton"" (emphasis added).  Police officers went to that location and ""seized the specific described loaded 12 gauge shotgun.""  A commonsense reading of the affidavit is that CI#1 provided information about the concealed location of a shotgun and specifically described it as a loaded 12 gauge model.  The statement that it was ""illegally possessed"" was made by the police and establishes that the shotgun was contraband.', '', ""Nor does a determination of an informant's veracity necessarily depend on a prior tip having led to an arrest or conviction.  As past decisions have recognized, that a confidential informant's prior tip led to the seizure of contraband supports that informant's reliability, even absent information that an arrest or conviction resulted.  See Commonwealth v. Mendes,"", ', 365 (2012) (""reliability was established through previous instances where [the informant\'s] information led to the confiscation of illegal narcotics""); Commonwealth v. Vynorius,', ', 21 (1975) (reliability established by informant\'s previously having ""furnished police with accurate information [that] resulted in the recovery of a stolen battery""); Commonwealth v.

Kiley,', ', 939 (1981) (""The reliability of [an] informant could be inferred from the recital that tips from him had led to the recovery of contraband at an earlier time"").', 'Finally, any deficiency in the showing of CI#1\'s veracity here was counterbalanced by independent ""police corroboration"" of a nonobvious detail of the current tip.  Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 377.  See Bakoian, 412 Mass. at 301-302 (police corroboration of tip\'s nonobvious or predictive details helped show informant\'s reliability and thus probable cause).  It may be true, as the defendant argues, that anyone in the area could have observed that a 1996 red Acura Integra was sitting, ""not in use,"" in the parking lot behind where the defendant\'s father lived on Main Street.  The nonobvious detail provided by CI#1, however, was the connection between the Acura and the defendant.  Had the Acura been driven regularly by the defendant or a family member, anyone in the area might have observed that activity and connected the defendant to the vehicle.  But it was concededly not in use -- it ""always remain[ed] parked in the same location"" -- and so the defendant\'s link to it was not obvious.', 'As Trooper Connolly\'s affidavit recounted, further investigation of CI#1\'s tip revealed that an Acura Integra had once been registered to the defendant (under a different registration number); that the defendant had told his Federal probation officer that he had purchased a 1996 Acura Integra; that Brockton police responding to a prior domestic violence call (apparently two years earlier) had arrested the defendant in a ""little red car"" at the Main Street address; and that the Acura in the parking lot was registered to a woman with the same last name as the defendant, but who lived in Taunton rather than Brockton.  This information, taken together and read in a commonsense fashion rather than hypertechnically, was sufficient to corroborate CI#1\'s tip connecting the defendant to the Acura.', 'Conclusion.  The affidavit sufficiently established the veracity of CI#1, and any shortcoming in that regard was compensated for by corroboration of a nonobvious detail supplied by CI#1.  It follows that the motion to suppress was correctly denied.  The defendant offers no other basis for overturning his conviction.', 'Judgment affirmed.']"

Here, while the defendant's criminal history is extensive, his most recent arrest for a firearm-related offense was eight years prior to the search in question.  Such a conviction is too remote in time to support probable cause that a firearm would be in his residence or on his person.
