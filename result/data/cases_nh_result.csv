Ayotte, attorney general (Thomas E. Bocian, attorney, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Desfosses Law Firm, of Portsmouth (Philip Desfosses on the brief and orally), and Samdperil & Welsh, PLLC, of Exeter (Richard E. Samdperil on the brief), for the defendant.', 'GALWAY, J. The defendant, Peter Munoz, appeals his conviction following a jury trial for attempted burglary, see RSA 635:1 (2007); RSA 629:1 (2007), arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motions to quash and to dismiss, and in permitting certain testimony. We affirm.', 'The record discloses the following facts. On May 29, 2003, Jennifer Durbin was alone in her second-floor apartment at the Fairways apartment complex in Derry when she heard a noise from her living room. When she went to investigate, she saw a man standing on her balcony attempting to pry open her sliding-glass door with an orange-handled screwdriver. When the man noticed her, he pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his head, jumped off the balcony and departed. Durbin called the police. Upon their arrival, the police obtained a description of the man, and a latent fingerprint from the exterior handle of the balcony door.', 'Later that morning, an anonymous female caller with a Hispanic accent telephoned the Derry Police Department and spoke with Officer Barry Charewicz. She informed him that she had the name of someone the police “should be looking at for the Fairways attempted burglary.” Despite being asked, the caller would not give her name, but did provide the defendant’s name, age and physical description. The caller also stated that she and the defendant knew each other because they were from the same country. Shortly before trial, the caller was identified as the defendant’s wife, Naomi Pena.', 'Based upon the information received from the then-anonymous tip, the police contacted the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) (now known as the United States Customs and Immigration Services) and obtained a fingerprint card for the defendant. It was later determined that the fingerprint from the balcony matched one on that card.', 'Approximately one month after finding the man on her balcony, Durbin and her husband moved out of their apartment. Three or four days prior to moving, the Durbins held a furniture sale at their apartment. Durbin testified that she recalled seeing the defendant and his wife at the sale, and that she sold them some furniture. Durbin testified that she was startled by the defendant’s presence at the sale because she believed, though was not certain, that she recognized him as the man from her balcony. Durbin also testified that even at the time of trial she could not be certain if the defendant was, in fact, the man on her balcony.', 'In July 2003, with the defendant’s wife acting as an interpreter, the police spoke with the defendant at his apartment. According to the interviewing officer’s testimony, after being told that his fingerprint was found on the balcony, the defendant stated that he was not in Derry but in Boston on May 29. Later in the interview, the defendant stated that he was in Colombia on that day, but then stated that he had actually returned from Colombia before May 29. According to the officer, the defendant explained that his fingerprint might have been found in Durbin’s apartment because he had been there to buy furniture, or because he had visited a prior tenant there, but he could not recall the tenant’s last name. At the conclusion of the interview, the police received the defendant’s wife’s permission to search her two cars and a slightly bent, orange-handled screwdriver was found in one.', 'The defendant was subsequently indicted for attempted burglary. Prior to trial, he moved to quash the indictment, arguing that it was defective. The Trial Court (Morrill, J.) denied the motion. He renewed his argument in a motion to dismiss at the close of the State’s case, which the Trial Court (Coffey, J.) also denied. Additionally, before trial the defendant moved to preclude the State from referring to the anonymous telephone call or from disclosing its contents. The Trial Court (Coffey, J.), however, admitted testimony about the call, subject to certain limitations. The defendant appealed these rulings following his conviction for attempted burglary.', 'On appeal the defendant first contends, under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, that the trial court erred in denying his motions to quash and dismiss because the indictment was inadequate. According to the defendant, because burglary is essentially an attempt to enter a building to commit some other offense, for a burglary indictment to be adequate, it must allege which crime the perpetrator would have committed in furtherance of the burglary. The defendant contends that because a burglary indictment must allege the crime to be committed, so must an indictment for attempted burglary. Because the indictment here did not allege what other offense would be committed upon entry, it was defective.', '“A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with a purpose that a crime be committed, he does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the crime.” RSA 629:1, I. Attempt is an inchoate crime that is considered a substantive offense in and of itself. State v. Johnson, 144 N.H. 175, 178 (1999). To be constitutionally adequate, an indictment charging an attempt must allege both an intent to commit a crime and an overt act in furtherance of the crime. Id. at 177, 178. However, while the attempt statute requires the State to identify the intended offense, it does not require the State to plead and prove the elements of the intended offense and it is ordinarily sufficient to state the intended offense generally. Id. at 178. “Since an attempted crime is by definition a crime not completed, the State could not plead, factually identify, and prove the elements of the intended offense as if it had been carried out.” Id.', 'Here, the indictment alleges that the defendant had the requisite intent and alleges an overt act in furtherance of the crime as well as the crime attempted, i.e., burglary. Therefore, it is constitutionally adequate. Id. at 177, 178. Charging the defendant with attempted burglary does not require the State to specify the offense the defendant would have committed in furtherance of the burglary. Requiring the State to comply with the defendant’s argument would require it to plead and prove the elements of the crime attempted, a result contrary to Johnson. Moreover, such a requirement would force the State to prove more than is required by the attempt statute, see RSA 629:1, I. The indictment meets the requirements for an adequate attempt charge and it describes the offense with sufficient specificity to allow the defendant to prepare for trial. Id. at 177.', 'The defendant argues that not requiring the State to identify the crime to be committed would leave the jury to speculate about what crime would have been committed. Permitting such speculation, according to the defendant, is impermissible because the jury could convict the defendant without reaching a unanimous decision regarding the crime that would have been committed. Unanimity, however, is required only as to the elements of the crime charged. See State v. Greene, 137 N.H. 126, 128 (1993) (“The New Hampshire Criminal Code requires jury unanimity with respect to the presence of the elements of offenses in criminal cases as charged.”). Here, the crime charged is attempted burglary, and unanimity is needed only as to its elements. What crime or offense the defendant would have committed in furtherance of the burglary is not an element of attempt, and, therefore, does not require unanimity. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant’s motions to quash and dismiss.', 'Next, the defendant contends that in admitting the officer’s testimony regarding the substance of his conversation with the anonymous caller, the trial court violated his right of confrontation under both the State and Federal Constitutions. See N.H. CONST., pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amends. VI, XIV. Before trial, the defendant sought to exclude testimony regarding the anonymous call, but the trial court nevertheless permitted the State to introduce portions of the call through Charewicz, which the State did. The defendant argues that admitting Charewicz’s testimony was error.', 'We address first the defendant’s argument under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. See State v. Miller, 155 N.H. 246, 253 (2007). The defendant contends that his rights under the State Constitution were violated because admitting Charewicz’s testimony was contrary to Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). We have not , however, adopted the Crawford analysis as applicable in this State, see State v. Ayer, 154 N.H. 500, 511 (2006), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 63 (2007), and the defendant does not argue that we should do so here. Moreover, the defendant offers no argument under any other standard regarding the violation of his rights under the State Constitution. See id. (noting that we have traditionally applied the analysis in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980), to Confrontation Clause challenges under the State Constitution). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant does not prevail on his claim under the New Hampshire Constitution.', 'In support of his claim under the Federal Constitution, the defendant relies principally upon Crawford, wherein the United States Supreme Court held that testimonial hearsay is inadmissible under the Federal Confrontation Clause unless the declarant is unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68. As the First Circuit has stated:', 'Crawford holds that a declarant’s “testimonial” out-of-court', 'statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless', '(1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior', 'opportunity for cross-examination and the declarant is', 'unavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other than', 'establishing the truth of the matter asserted. United States v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2006) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 568 (2007); see also Ayer, 154 N.H. at 505. Here, it is undisputed that Pena did not testify and that the defendant never had an opportunity to cross-examine her. Accordingly, resolution of the instant matter requires us to determine whether the evidence was admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.', '“The Supreme Court has held in several instances that nonhearsay statements do not implicate the Confrontation Clause.” United States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1199 (2006). Moreover, “[i]n several cases, [the First Circuit] has held that when statements are offered only to provide context and not for the truth of the matter asserted, those statements are not hearsay.” Id. The “‘context’ rationale,” however, does not provide unlimited discretion to permit police testimony; what is most important is the precise nature of the context provided. Maher, 454 F.3d at 22. Here, the State argues that Pena’s statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendant attempted to burglarize Durbin’s apartment, but to provide context for the investigation that followed. Indeed, the trial court ruled that Charewicz’s testimony about the caller’s statements was admissible to show the state of mind of the police, and the basis for their contact with INS. The defendant, however, contends that the testimony was offered to show that he had committed the crime.', 'As noted previously, before trial, the defendant sought to exclude all references to the telephonic tip and its contents. The State countered that the testimony regarding the tip would not be offered for its truth, but only to show why the investigation “took the turn that it did.” The defendant then offered to permit the State to say that “a police investigation led us to suspect [the defendant].” This compromise was rejected by the trial court because it believed such a statement would imply that the police were aware of past criminal activity by the defendant, and would thus unfairly prejudice him. In the end, the trial court permitted the prosecution to admit Charewicz’s testimony to the extent it would relate that the tipster said the defendant was one the police ought to “look at” in the Fairways attempted burglary, and that the caller gave a physical description of the defendant and knew the defendant because they were from the same country. The trial court stated that this testimony would be admitted in:', 'the manner in which we would similarly put in any kind of', 'anonymous tip that’s called in, that it’s being offered to show the', 'state of mind of the police and it’s on that basis, that they', 'predicated their next step, which was the fingerprint analysis.', 'They had somewhere to go for that. Thus, the trial court ruled that the testimony would not be admitted for its truth, but only to show why the police contacted INS and began investigating the defendant.', 'In his opening statement, the prosecutor relayed to the jury the contents of the call consistent with the trial court’s ruling, and informed them that the description provided by the caller was the same as that given by Durbin. The prosecutor then informed the jury that based upon the information provided in the call, the police contacted INS. Later, the State introduced Charewicz’s testimony as described previously, using leading questions so as to tailor the testimony to the trial court’s pretrial ruling. Finally, in its closing, the State again related to the jury that the caller had given the police the defendant’s name and physical description and had stated that she and the defendant were from the same country, and that as a result of this call the police contacted INS.', '“It is well settled that where a conversation is relevant irrespective of the truth of what is said, the hearsay rule does not operate to exclude the testimony.” State v. Martineau, 116 N.H. 797, 798 (1976). Here, the trial court ruled that the testimony, as it has been described, would not be admitted for its truth, but only to show that a tip was given and that the police acted upon the information received. Thus, the trial court recognized that it was relevant that the conversation occurred and that it prompted the police to contact INS, regardless of whether the information in the call was, in fact, true. Accordingly, testimony about the call was admissible for a non-hearsay purpose. While the trial court did not issue an instruction to the jury informing them of the limited purpose for the testimony, the trial court had no obligation to do so absent a request therefore, or an objection to the lack thereof, by the defendant. See State v. Pelletier, 149 N.H. 243, 253 (2003).', 'The defendant contends that “if the statement was being admitted to show the police officers’ state of mind, . . . then there was no need to include the caller’s physical description of the defendant or her statement that [the defendant] was the one who committed the attempted break-in.” The trial court, however, ruled that this information was permissible to show why the police contacted INS, as opposed to continuing their investigation in some other way. As argued by the prosecutor, “It has to make sense. Why would they go to INS?” In other contexts, we have noted that in assessing whether it is reasonable for the police to pursue an anonymous tip, we examine the reliability and credibility of the informant, and his or her basis of knowledge, as well as the quantity, quality and reliability of the information given. State v. Sousa, 151 N.H. 297, 299 (2004). Here, inclusion of information such as the description and the provision of a name in reference to a particular incident helped to explain why the police might consider the tip to be reliable and why contacting INS for the defendant’s fingerprint card was a reasonable step in light of the information obtained. Accordingly, because the information conveyed to the jury served to demonstrate the reasonableness of the police action in contacting INS, we conclude that the trial court’s decision to permit the evidence on that ground was not error.', 'The defendant also contends that the testimony about the tip was offered for its truth because, during opening statements, the prosecutor used the information in the tip to corroborate the description given by Durbin. The defendant, however, made no objection to the prosecutor’s argument during trial. Any argument that the State strayed beyond the trial court’s pretrial ruling that the evidence was admitted for a limited, non-hearsay purpose should have been made to the trial court in the first instance, and we will not entertain objections that were not raised during the proceedings below because they are not preserved for our review. State v. Wong, 138 N.H. 56, 66 (1993).', 'Finally, the defendant contends that even if Charewicz’s testimony was not hearsay, it was more prejudicial than probative, and, therefore, should not have been admitted. See N.H. R. Ev. 403. The State counters that the issue has not been preserved, or, if it has, the defendant does not prevail. As pointed out by the State, at no point did the defendant object to the introduction of any part of Charewicz’s testimony on the ground that it would be more prejudicial than probative, nor did he invoke Rule 403’s balancing of probative and prejudicial effect. His objection was based upon the Confrontation Clause and not upon the supposed prejudicial nature of the evidence. In fact, the only time prejudice was mentioned was when the trial court ruled, without comment or objection from the defendant, that some portions of the call would be excluded as unfairly prejudicial. Even after this ruling, the defendant did not contend that the testimony permitted by the trial court was more prejudicial than probative. For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant has failed to preserve the issue for our review. See State v. Pepin, 156 N.H. 269, 275 (2007).', 'For the above reasons, we conclude that Charewicz’s testimony was properly admitted by the trial court for a non-hearsay purpose. Accordingly, the testimony was not barred by Crawford.', 'Affirmed.', 'BRODERICK, C.J., and DALIANIS and HICKS, JJ., concurred. ']"

Ayotte, attorney general (Nicholas Cort, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Theodore Lothstein, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief, and Paul Borchardt, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, orally, for the defendant.', 'DUGGAN, J. Following a jury trial in the Superior Court (Barry, J.), the defendant, Scott Robinson, was convicted of robbery and first degree assault. See RSA 636:1 (2007); RSA 631:1 (2007). He appeals his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We reverse and remand.', 'The record supports the following facts. On March 18, 2006, around 9:50 p.m., Manchester police responded to a reported robbery at the Cross Town Variety Store. Upon arriving, witnesses told police that a white male, twenty-five to thirty years old, roughly six feet tall and weighing 200 pounds, wearing a Patriots jacket and a green hooded sweatshirt, entered the store, went behind the counter, and stabbed the clerk at least three times before leaving with cash from the register. A witness told police that he had followed the suspect as he left the store, and watched him run past a car and into an alley off Amory Street.', 'Upon searching the area behind the counter, police found a key ring, containing three keys, one of which belonged to a Kia automobile. After the employees denied that it belonged to any of them, the police presumed that it belonged to the suspect. Responding officers were then told to be on the lookout for a Kia in the area. Officers found a Kia nearby, and confirmed that the fleeing suspect had run past that car before turning into the alley. After relaying the license plate to dispatch, police learned that the car belonged to the defendant, that he lived eight blocks from the store in the direction the suspect had run, and that he had a prior robbery conviction. At that point, officers were sent to the defendant’s apartment building.', 'While those officers were en route, another officer took the car key from the crime scene, inserted it into the door of the Kia and turned it; they matched. The officer relayed that information to the officers at the defendant’s apartment building. By approximately 10:30 p.m., four officers were present outside the defendant’s building. Officers outside the building could see movement inside, and those in the hallway outside the defendant’s apartment could hear movement in the apartment. Officers also observed what appeared to be wet footprints in the hallway leading to the defendant’s apartment door.', 'The officers knocked on the defendant’s door and announced their presence but received no response. They then spoke to a neighbor and asked her if the defendant lived in that apartment. After officers brought her down to a police cruiser and showed her a picture of the defendant on a computer, she confirmed that he lived there. Upon returning to the defendant’s door, police heard a female voice say something to the effect of “you’re such an idiot,” and again knocked and announced their presence.', 'When the officers heard footsteps approaching the door, they unholstered their weapons and pointed them at the ground. The defendant’s girlfriend, Kimberly Dunn, opened the door, at which point the officers raised their weapons, told her to get on her knees and searched her for a weapon. The trial court found that two officers simultaneously stepped into the apartment and opened a closed closet to ensure nobody was hiding there. Upon opening the closet, the officers saw a Patriots jacket and a green hooded sweatshirt.', 'Dunn then told the officers that the defendant was in the bedroom with a knife to his chest. The officers went to the bedroom, found the defendant, arrested him and took him out of the apartment. After conducting only a brief search for possible threats, the officers secured the premises and applied for a search warrant. At no time prior to entering the defendant’s home did the officers attempt to secure a search or arrest warrant. Upon execution of the warrant, police seized a green sweatshirt, a Patriots jacket and a knife.', 'Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence found in his apartment, arguing that the officers’ initial warrantless entry was unconstitutional. Following a suppression hearing, the trial court denied his motion in a written order. After a jury convicted the defendant of robbery and first degree assault, he filed this appeal.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, he argues that: (1) the officer’s insertion of the key into the car door was a warrantless search and violated his constitutional rights; (2) the police lacked probable cause to enter his home; and (3) no exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless entry into his apartment.', 'When reviewing a trial court’s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the trial court’s findings unless they are unsupported by the record or clearly erroneous. State v. Pseudae, 154 N.H. 196, 199 (2006). We review the trial court’s legal conclusions de novo. Id.', 'We first address the defendant’s argument that the officer’s insertion of the key into the Kia door was an unconstitutional search under both the Federal and State Constitutions. The trial court found that the police did not rely upon the key match in forming probable cause, and thus made no ruling on the issue. In the interests of judicial economy, however, we address the issue as it is likely to arise on remand and because there are sufficient facts in the record upon which we can reach our conclusion as a matter of law. Cf. Auger v. Town of Strafford, 156 N.H. 64, 67 (2007). We initially address the defendant’s claim under the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 232–33 (1983).', 'Part I, Article 19 provides that “[e]very subject hath a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.” “We have . . . recognized that an expectation of privacy plays a role in the protection afforded under Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution.” State v. Goss, 150 N.H. 46, 48 (2003). Thus, without an invasion of the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy, there has been no violation of the defendant’s rights under Part I, Article 19. Compare Goss, 150 N.H. at 48-49 (holding defendant has reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of black garbage bags left out for collection), with State v. Johnston, 150 N.H. 448, 452 (2004) (holding defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in curtilage to his home when there was no gate, he had not posted “no trespassing” signs and the driveway was visible from the street).', 'The State argues that Part I, Article 19 does not apply in this case because the insertion of the key into the door does not constitute a search for constitutional purposes. Indeed, the defendant acknowledges that federal courts have minimized the zone of protection with regard to inserting a key into a door. He argues, however, that we should adopt a standard of greater protection under the State Constitution. Although we have recognized that our constitution does, in some circumstances, provide greater protection than the Federal Constitution, see, e.g., State v. Beauchesne, 151 N.H. 803, 812 (2005), this is not such a case.', 'Here, the privacy interest at stake is “so small that the officers do not need probable cause to inspect it.” United States v. Concepcion, 942 F.2d 1170, 1173 (7th Cir. 1991); accord United States v. Lyons, 898 F.2d 210, 212- 13 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920 (1990); United States v. DeBardeleben, 740 F.2d 440, 443-45 (6th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1028 (1984); Com. v. Alvarez, 661 N.E.2d 1293, 1303 (Mass. 1996). Because vehicles must be registered and display license plates, see RSA 261:40 (Supp. 2008); RSA 261:75, II (2004), who owns a car is not private information. See United States v. Grandstaff, 813 F.2d 1353, 1358 n.6 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 837 (1987). Rather, the private information protected by Part I, Article 19 is what lies behind the door. In this case, the officer removed the key from the convenience store with the permission of the store owner, inserted the key into the lock and turned the key. He did not open the door or conduct any search of the vehicle. Because the officer did not intrude upon the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy, the defendant’s rights under Part I, Article 19 were not violated.', 'The defendant also argues that our ruling in this case is dictated by our prior rejection of an “identification search” exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Webber, 141 N.H. 817, 821 (1997). The case is inapplicable here. In Webber, a police officer reached into the defendant’s wallet to remove a prescription card without the defendant’s permission. Id. at 818. Our rejection of the exception was based upon the fact that the officer unreasonably searched the defendant’s wallet, not upon the nature of what the officer sought. Id. at 821. Thus, Webber is inapposite to this case.', 'We reach the same result under the Federal Constitution. Whether the defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated turns upon whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the thing searched. As federal courts have consistently held, the mere information of ownership obtained from inserting a key into a door is not the type of information in which a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Concepcion, 942 F.2d at 1173; Lyons, 898 F.2d at 212-13; Grandstaff, 813 F.2d at 1358 n.6; DeBardeleben, 740 F.2d at 443-45. Because the defendant had no expectation of privacy in this case, the officer’s conduct did not violate the protections of the Fourth Amendment.', 'As to the defendant’s second argument, we will assume, without deciding, that the police had probable cause to enter his apartment. The issue before us, therefore, is whether exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into his home. We first address the defendant’s claim under the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. See Ball, 124 N.H. at 232-33.', 'Under Part I, Article 19, a warrantless search or seizure is per se unreasonable, and evidence derived from such a search or seizure is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. State v. Santana, 133 N.H. 798, 803 (1991); State v. Beede, 119 N.H. 620, 625 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 983 (1980). The search of a home is subject to a particularly stringent warrant requirement because the occupant has a high expectation of privacy. State v. Theodosopoulos, 119 N.H. 573, 580 (1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 967 (1980). As the United States Supreme Court has recently made clear, exceptions to the warrant requirement must remain closely tethered to their underlying justifications lest they become incompatible with the fundamental principles secured by the Constitution. See Arizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 1719 (2009). The State has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the warrantless entry fell within one of the narrow, judicially- crafted exceptions. State v. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. 100, 103 (2008).', 'One such exception, which the State argues applies here, exists where police have probable cause to enter a home and exigent circumstances make it impracticable to obtain a warrant beforehand. State v. Graca, 142 N.H. 670, 673 (1998). Exigent circumstances exist where police face a compelling need for immediate official action and a risk that the delay inherent in obtaining a warrant will present a substantial threat of imminent danger to life or public safety or create a likelihood that evidence will be destroyed. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 104; State v. MacElman, 149 N.H. 795, 798 (2003). Whether exigent circumstances exist is judged by the totality of the circumstances, and is largely a question of fact for the trial court. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 104. Our totality review includes an examination of the overall reasonableness of the officers’ conduct prior to entry, but no single factor controls. Santana, 133 N.H. at 804. We will not disturb the trial court’s finding of exigent circumstances unless is it clearly erroneous. Id.', 'Here, the trial court determined that exigency existed because the officers, upon arriving at the defendant’s home, “were essentially in hot pursuit, without time to reflect upon the situation or obtain a warrant.” The trial court directed the majority of its analysis to the officers’ actions after the defendant’s girlfriend opened the door. Even the State acknowledges, however, that this case is not one of hot pursuit, which “requires immediate and continuous pursuit of a defendant from the scene of a crime.” State v. Ricci, 144 N.H. 241, 244 (1999). In Ricci, for example, police followed an intoxicated driver to his house, and then ran inside after him when the driver tried to hide in his home. Id. at 242. Here, police arrived at the defendant’s home approximately forty to forty-five minutes after the robbery was reported; such a delay cannot be considered hot pursuit.', 'The defendant concedes that exigent circumstances existed once Dunn told the officers that the defendant had a knife to his chest. He argues, however, that the police themselves created the exigent circumstances, which did not exist before they entered his home.', 'As the defendant points out, “The primary focus of our inquiry . . . is not on the sufficiency of the exigency but rather how the exigency came about.” Santana, 133 N.H. at 805. Thus, if no exigency existed before the police became involved, the police cannot themselves create the exigency to justify a warrantless entry. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 108; Santana, 133 N.H. at 807; Theodosopoulos, 119 N.H. at 581. In our analysis of whether police presence was the cause of the exigency, two considerations act as “guideposts”: (1) the presence or absence of “ample opportunity” to get a warrant; and (2) the degree to which the exigency relied upon by the State was foreseeable. See Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 108 (quotation omitted).', 'In Rodriguez, for example, police officers detected the odor of burning marijuana outside a hotel room while investigating an unrelated crime. Id. Because the officers had not gone to the hotel to investigate the drug crime, we found that the exigency was not foreseeable. Id. at 109. Thus, in light of the ongoing destruction of evidence in the hotel room, there was no opportunity to secure a warrant before knocking and entering. Id. at 110. We therefore held that the trial court’s finding of exigent circumstances was not clearly erroneous. Id. at 110; see Santana, 133 N.H. at 807 (police may not rely upon an “expected exigency” to justify warrantless entry into defendant’s apartment where “police, with ample probable cause, time to obtain a warrant, and time for reflection, choose to pursue a course of action which they know at the outset [would] present a situation requiring an emergency entrance into a person’s home”); Mendez v. People, 986 P.2d 275, 282 (Colo. 1999) (affirming finding of exigency because police encounter was inadvertent and no officer “made a deliberate decision to go to the motel” to gather evidence of that particular crime), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1070 (2000).', 'Here, police made the deliberate determination to go to the defendant’s home to investigate the robbery. The State argues that the defendant posed a danger to others based upon the robbery, and that the police therefore faced exigent circumstances requiring immediate action. As discussed below, however, the State cannot point to any evidence that would have led the police to reasonably conclude that the defendant continued to pose a threat once he retreated to his apartment. It was not until after police entered his home that they knew of the specific exigency of the defendant holding a knife to his chest. Two officers testified that they secured Dunn and simultaneously searched a nearby closet for a concealed individual, at which time Dunn informed them that the defendant was in the bedroom with a knife to his chest. By that point, however, the officers had already entered his home without consent, and without first obtaining a warrant. Because the police had no knowledge of any exigency until after they entered the home, the State cannot now rely upon the ensuing emergency to justify the initial entry. See Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 108; Santana, 133 N.H. at 807.', 'The State argues, however, that exigency existed prior to the officers’ entry into the apartment and Dunn’s statement. Specifically, the State argues that the facts of this case support a “fleeing suspect” exigency. In support, the State cites Dorman v. United States, 435 F.2d 385 (D.C. Cir. 1970). There, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set forth six factors that may be useful for determining exigency: (1) a grave offense occurred, particularly one involving violence; (2) the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed; (3) there exists not merely the minimum of probable cause, but beyond that a clear showing of probable cause; (4) there is strong reason to believe that the suspect is in the premises being entered; (5) there is a likelihood that the suspect will escape if not swiftly apprehended; and (6) the circumstance that the entry, though not consented, is made peaceably. Dorman, 435 F.2d at 392–93. Dorman also considered the time of entry and the actual difficulty police faced in obtaining a warrant. Id. at 394–95.', 'Although federal courts have diverged in their acceptance and application of the Dorman test, the United States Supreme Court remained largely silent on the matter until Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91 (1990). In Olson, a lone gunman robbed a gas station shortly before 6:00 a.m., fatally shooting the manager. Olson, 495 U.S. at 93. Police drove to the house of a suspect, and met another car, driven by the defendant, in which the suspected gunman was a passenger. Id. The two men fled from the car and the gunman was captured, but the defendant managed to escape. Id. Inside the car, police found materials identifying the defendant. Id. The next morning, a woman called the police and said that the defendant had driven the car in the robbery and that he planned to leave town by bus. Id. She also gave an address for two women who knew where to find the defendant. Id. Later that afternoon, police surrounded the home. Id. at 94. After they determined that the defendant was inside, they entered the house without permission or a warrant and with weapons drawn. Id. The Minnesota Supreme Court applied the Dorman analysis and determined that no exigency existed. State v. Olson, 436 N.W.2d 92, 97 & n.1 (Minn. 1989).', 'On appeal, the United States Supreme Court did not expressly adopt or reject Dorman, but held that the Minnesota Supreme Court “applied essentially the correct standard in determining whether exigent circumstances existed.” Olson, 495 U.S. at 100. The Court noted that the state supreme court observed that “a warrantless intrusion may be justified by hot pursuit of a fleeing felon, or imminent destruction of evidence, or the need to prevent a suspect’s escape, or the risk of danger to the police or to other persons inside or outside the dwelling.” Id. (quotation omitted). The Court also noted that the state court considered “the gravity of the crime and the likelihood that the suspect is armed.” Id. The Court stated that it was “not inclined to disagree with this fact-specific application of the proper legal standard,” and affirmed the state court’s finding that no exigency occurred. Id.', 'We see no need to adopt Dorman in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Olson. We, like the Court, have consistently held that the determination of exigency rests upon the totality of the circumstances. See Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 104; Santana, 133 N.H. at 804. Police, as well as courts reviewing a warrantless entry, should consider the danger of imminent destruction of evidence, the gravity of the offense, the likelihood the suspect is armed, the need to prevent a suspect’s escape, and the risk of danger to the police or to other persons inside or outside the dwelling. See Olson, 495 U.S. at 100; Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 753 (1984). In this case, although the gravity of the offense was serious and the defendant was believed to be armed, our examination of the totality of the circumstances forces us to conclude that no exigency existed that made it impractical to secure a warrant beforehand.', 'The State cannot point to any substantive evidence that would have led officers to believe that the defendant would either destroy evidence or attempt to flee his home, or that he posed a risk if not immediately apprehended. Compare State v. Morse, 125 N.H. 403, 409 (1984) (holding no exigency when “officers had no apparent grounds for a belief that the defendant would escape”), with United States v. Williams, 612 F.2d 735, 737 (3d Cir. 1979) (finding exigency where defendant was armed and reliable informant told police he planned to “get his affairs together and then head south”), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 934 (1980). Indeed, an officer at the suppression hearing testified that they had no reason to believe evidence was being destroyed or would be if they did not act quickly, and no officer articulated a fear that the defendant would escape. See Welsh, 466 U.S. at 751 (“When an officer undertakes to act as his own magistrate, he ought to be in a position to justify it by pointing to some real immediate and serious consequences if he postponed action to get a warrant.” (quotation omitted)).', 'The situation here is similar to that in Olson, where there was no risk of immediate flight, no suggestion of danger to officers, and “[t]hree or four Minneapolis police squads surrounded the house.” Olson, 495 U.S. at 101 (quotation omitted). Had Olson come out, “he would have been promptly apprehended.” Id. (quotation omitted). Here, police had no specific information that the defendant intended to flee, and, indeed, had his apartment surrounded so as to prevent flight. Furthermore, before officers knocked on his door, there was no evidence that the defendant was an immediate danger to himself, to the police or to the other person in the apartment. Although the State argues that he was at least a danger to Dunn based upon his conduct at the store, it cannot point to any other evidence to suggest that she was actually in danger. See State v. Slade, 116 N.H. 436, 438 (1976) (holding gunshots in home justified warrantless police entry to determine whether there was a victim); see also United States v. Holloway, 290 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (11th Cir. 2002) (listing cases and situations in which endangerment to life justified warrantless entry), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1161 (2003); People v. McBride, 872 N.Y.S. 2d 109 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009) (finding exigent circumstances when police observed distraught and hyperventilating woman through window who was unable to respond to inquiries about what was happening). Indeed, the fact that the defendant had returned to his own home during the night hours militates against a finding of exigency. See Hathock v. Cohen, 547 F. Supp. 2d 1271, 1277 n.7 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (noting that burglary suspect fleeing into “another’s home gives rise to exigent circumstances whereas a suspect entering his own home does not”).', 'The State argues that the facts here are analogous to Theodosopoulos, in which we held that exigent circumstances existed. Theodosopoulos, 119 N.H. 573. There, a sniper fired a shot into a police station, seriously injuring an officer and a civilian. Id. at 576. Police then methodically searched neighboring buildings until forcing their way into the defendant’s apartment. Id. at 577. They found him apparently asleep in the bedroom, with a riflescope and spent shell casings on a table and marijuana plants on the floor. Id. at 578. We held that the nature of the “highly volatile” emergency and the need to protect the public from further harm justified the warrantless search of the area and the defendant’s apartment. Id. at 580–81. The State argues that this case is similar in that both cases involved only one incident of violence and a continuous, methodical search for the suspect. Here, however, police had no reason to believe that the defendant posed any danger in his current location, whereas in Theodosopoulos, police were unsure of the sniper’s location and reasonably feared he might fire again if not apprehended.', 'Finally, we consider the fact that the officers did not even attempt to obtain a warrant after learning the location of the defendant’s home. In Dorman, for example, police were unable to obtain a warrant because the magistrates who were supposed to be available that night were not. Dorman, 435 F.2d at 394-95; see United States v. Campbell, 581 F.2d 22, 27 (2d Cir. 1978) (considering fact that although no warrant application was filed, officers did contact an Assistant United States Attorney for an evaluation of their situation, and thus “showed their respect for the Fourth Amendment”). But see State v. Steimel, 155 N.H. 141, 149 (2007) (holding officer does not necessarily need to attempt to find a magistrate when time lost would risk destruction of evidence). In contrast, the Supreme Court held in Olson that once police had the home surrounded and foreclosed the defendant’s escape, they were required to obtain a warrant. Olson, 495 U.S. at 101. Here, police had surrounded the defendant’s apartment and effectively foreclosed the possibility of flight.', 'Because the record does not reveal any evidence that would have led the police to reasonably believe that the defendant continued to pose a danger to himself, to the police or to the other occupant in the apartment, because the police had blocked any routes of escape, and because the officers testified that they had no reason to believe evidence was being or would be destroyed, we hold that no exigent circumstances existed requiring immediate, warrantless entry. The trial court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to suppress was therefore clearly erroneous.', 'In light of our ruling under the State Constitution, we need not reach the federal issue. See Ball, 124 N.H. at 237.', 'Reversed and remanded.', 'BRODERICK, C.J., and DALIANIS and HICKS, JJ., concurred. ']"

Delaney, attorney general (Nicholas Cort, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Pamela E. Phelan, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'DUGGAN, J. The defendant, Soiluis Nieves, was charged with possession of a controlled drug with intent to sell and conspiracy to commit sale of a controlled drug. See RSA 318-B:2 (Supp. 2008); RSA 629:3 (2007). The State appeals an order of the Superior Court (Hicks, J.) granting the defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized under the “plain view” exception to the warrant requirement. We reverse and remand.', 'The following facts were found by the trial court in its order on the defendant’s motion to suppress. In April 2008, Detective Kevin Rourke of the Nashua Police Department worked with a confidential informant on a drug investigation. The investigation focused on Radhames Melo and the defendant; the police suspected that both men were dealing drugs. Allegedly, the defendant, at Melo’s direction, repeatedly traveled from New Hampshire to New York City and then to the Dominican Republic, where he picked up approximately 500 grams of heroin. The defendant swallowed the drugs, returned to New Hampshire, and met Melo at a hotel, where he expelled them.', 'Following one of these trips, Detective Rourke and the confidential informant completed two drug purchases from Melo and the defendant. The second took place at the defendant’s apartment, located in a multi-family house on Perham Street in Nashua. Detective Rourke gave the informant money to buy heroin and watched him enter the apartment; shortly thereafter, the informant left and delivered a package of heroin to Detective Rourke. A surveillance team monitored the informant’s movements, and the police confirmed that the substance was heroin.', 'Detective Rourke applied for and received a search warrant for the defendant’s apartment. The warrant permitted the seizure of “Identification, documents and records relating to the trafficking of Narcotic drugs as well as other contraband listed in Attachment ‘A’, cellular phones and the information contained Therein, contrary to Revised Statutes Annotated 318-B:2.” Attachment A listed many items, including United States currency, drug use paraphernalia, firearms, documents identifying the apartment’s occupants, and records relating to drug trafficking. Neither the warrant nor Attachment A specifically permitted the officers to search for, or seize, “drugs”; the word “heroin” does not appear in the warrant or attachment.', 'On May 1, 2008, Detective Rourke and several other police officers executed the search warrant. They discovered thirty-one individually wrapped bags of heroin inside the pocket of a vest hanging in a bedroom closet. The police confiscated the drugs and arrested the defendant shortly thereafter.', 'Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the heroin, arguing that the police unlawfully seized it under the plain view exception because they did not inadvertently discover it. The State contended that the police properly seized the heroin, noting we have “left undecided the issue of whether contraband can be seized when its discovery is not inadvertent.” The State conceded that the discovery of the heroin was not inadvertent.', 'The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to suppress, reasoning that, given our plain view jurisprudence, “it is unclear, at best, whether the New Hampshire Supreme Court would be willing to abandon the inadvertency requirement when faced with a case like the one at hand.” The trial court ruled that, “as it stands, New Hampshire law requires trial courts to apply the inadvertence prong to all plain view seizures.” This appeal followed.', 'In reviewing the trial court’s rulings, we accept its factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous. State v. Steeves, 158 N.H. 672, 675 (2009). We review the trial court’s conclusions of law de novo. Id.', 'Warrantless seizures are per se unreasonable under Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution, unless they fall within the narrow confines of a judicially crafted exception. State v. Davis, 149 N.H. 698, 700 (2003). The State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the seizure falls within a recognized exception, such as the plain view exception. Id. at 700-01.', 'The United States Supreme Court first set forth “criteria that generally guide ‘plain-view’ seizures” in a plurality opinion in Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 465-73 (1971). Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 134 (1990). Under this exception, the State must prove that: (1) the initial intrusion which afforded the view was lawful; (2) the discovery of the evidence was inadvertent; and (3) the incriminating nature of the evidence was “immediately apparent.” Davis, 149 N.H. at 700-01; see Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 466, 469. The police must have probable cause to believe that the evidence is incriminating under the third prong of the analysis. See Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 326 (1987); State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 234-35 (1983) (requiring probable cause under state constitutional analysis). In Horton, however, the Court held that inadvertency would no longer be required under the Federal Constitution. Horton, 496 U.S. at 130. Therefore, the defendant’s sole claim is under the State Constitution.', 'With respect to the second prong, which requires that the discovery be inadvertent, the Coolidge Court reasoned that', 'where the discovery is anticipated, where the police know in advance the', 'location of the evidence and intend to seize it . . . [t]he requirement of a', 'warrant to seize imposes no inconvenience . . . or at least none which is', 'constitutionally cognizable in a legal system that regards warrantless', 'searches as “per se unreasonable” in the absence of “exigent', 'circumstances.”', 'If the initial intrusion is bottomed upon a warrant that fails to', 'mention a particular object, though the police know its location and', 'intend to seize it, then there is a violation of the express constitutional', 'requirement of “Warrants . . . particularly describing . . . [the] things to', 'be seized.” The initial intrusion may, of course, be legitimated not by a', 'warrant but by one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement . . . .', 'But to extend the scope of such an intrusion to the seizure of objects —', 'not contraband nor stolen nor dangerous in themselves — which the', 'police know in advance they will find in plain view and intend to seize,', 'would fly in the face of the basic rule that no amount of probable cause', 'can justify a warrantless seizure. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 470-71.', 'In Horton v. California, the United States Supreme Court eliminated the inadvertency requirement, holding that “even though inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate ‘plain-view’ seizures, it is not a necessary condition.” Horton, 496 U.S. at 130. While “[a] search compromises the individual interest in privacy,” “a seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his or her person or property.” Id. at 133. As the seizure of a piece of evidence may “invade the owner’s possessory interest,” the Court reasoned that “[i]f ‘plain view’ justifies an exception from an otherwise applicable warrant requirement . . . it must be an exception that is addressed to the concerns that are implicated by seizures rather than by searches.” Id. at 134.', 'The Court in Horton noted that the plurality opinion discussing the plain view doctrine in Coolidge “did not command a majority” and that the discussion was “not a binding precedent.” Id. at 136 (quotation omitted). The Court noted two flaws in the reasoning of Coolidge:', 'First, evenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of', 'objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon', 'the subjective state of mind of the officer. The fact that an officer is', 'interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course', 'of a search should not invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in', 'area and duration by the terms of a warrant or a valid exception to the', 'warrant requirement. If the officer has knowledge approaching certainty', 'that the item will be found, we see no reason why he or she would', 'deliberately omit a particular description of the item to be seized from the', 'application for a search warrant . . . . On the other hand, if he or she', 'has a valid warrant to search for one item and merely a suspicion', 'concerning the second, . . . we fail to see why that suspicion should', 'immunize the second item from seizure if it is found during a lawful', 'search for the first.', '....', 'Second, the suggestion that the inadvertence requirement is', 'necessary to prevent the police from conducting general searches, or', 'from converting specific warrants into general warrants, is not', 'persuasive because that interest is already served by the requirements', 'that no warrant issue unless it particularly describes the place to be', 'searched and the persons or things to be seized, and that a warrantless', 'search be circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation.', 'Scrupulous adherence to these requirements serves the interests in', 'limiting the area and duration of the search that the inadvertence', 'requirement inadequately protects. Once those commands have been', 'satisfied and the officer has a lawful right of access, however, no', 'additional Fourth Amendment interest is furthered by requiring that the', 'discovery of evidence be inadvertent. Id. at 138-40 (quotation, citations and brackets omitted).', 'Justices Brennan and Marshall dissented, asserting that “the majority ignores the Fourth Amendment’s express command that warrants particularly describe not only the places to be searched, but also the things to be seized.” Id. at 142. The dissent acknowledged “that the inadvertent discovery requirement furthers no privacy interests,” but noted that it “protect[s] possessory interests.” Id. at 147.', 'The rationale behind the inadvertent discovery requirement is simply', 'that we will not excuse officers from the general requirement of a warrant', 'to seize if the officers know the location of evidence, have probable cause', 'to seize it, intend to seize it, and yet do not bother to obtain a warrant', 'particularly describing that evidence. Id. at 144-45. “[T]o the individual whose possessory interest has been invaded, it matters not why the police officer decided to omit a particular item from his application for a search warrant.” Id. at 146. An officer with probable cause to seize an item who fails to mention that item in an application for a search warrant, but seizes that item nonetheless, acts unreasonably as a matter of law. Id. Accordingly, “[s]uppression of the evidence so seized will encourage officers to be more precise and complete in future warrant applications.” Id. The dissent noted that', 'there are a number of instances in which a law enforcement officer might', 'deliberately choose to omit certain items from a warrant application even', 'though he has probable cause to seize them, knows they are on the', 'premises, and intends to seize them when they are discovered in plain', 'view. Id.', 'The State urges us to follow Horton and abolish the inadvertency requirement under our state constitutional analysis. Alternatively, relying upon the plurality opinion in Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 469-71, the State argues that we should exempt objects that are “contraband,” “stolen,” or “dangerous in themselves” from the inadvertency requirement. The defendant contends that: (1) the State “misconstrues” the intent of the language in Coolidge; and (2) Part I, Article 19 provides greater protections of possessory interests than does the Fourth Amendment.', 'Our case law concerning the inadvertence requirement is “not ‘settled.’” Davis, 149 N.H. at 701 (quoting State v. Cote, 126 N.H. 514, 526 (1985)). While we currently require the discovery to be inadvertent under our state constitutional analysis, see Davis, 149 N.H. at 700-01, we have also stated that inadvertency is not required for guns as they are “dangerous in themselves.” State v. Slade, 116 N.H. 436, 439 (1976) (citing Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 439).', 'Some state courts have followed Horton and completely abolished the inadvertency requirement. See, e.g., State v. Loh, 914 P.2d 592, 600 (Mont. 1996); State v. Julius, 408 S.E.2d 1, 7 (W. Va. 1991). Hawaii and Massachusetts have declined to follow Horton and continue to require inadvertency. See Com. v. Balicki, 762 N.E.2d 290, 298 (Mass. 2002); State v. Meyer, 893 P.2d 159, 165 n.6 (Haw. 1995). A few courts have recognized the exception for objects that are “contraband,” “stolen,” or “dangerous in themselves” set out in Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 471. See, e.g., State v. Eady, 733 A.2d 112, 116 n.7 (Conn.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1030 (1999); State v. Nieves, 782 A.2d 203, 207 n.6 (Conn. App. Ct. 2001); Com. v. LaPlante, 622 N.E.2d 1357, 1361 n.9 (Mass. 1993) (inadvertency requirement does not apply to stolen goods). But see Balicki, 762 N.E.2d at 298 (finding that inadvertency requirement “continues to protect the possessory interests conferred on our citizens by” state constitution).', 'We hold today that, with respect to drugs, weapons, and other items “dangerous in themselves,” there is no longer an inadvertency requirement under our State Constitution. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 471; see Eady, 733 A.2d at 116 n.7; Com. v. Hason, 439 N.E.2d 251, 256 (Mass. 1982). Thus, we need not consider the State’s argument that we should adopt Horton.', 'Like the Fourth Amendment, Part I, Article 19 protects both the rights to privacy and to possessory property interests. See Horton, 496 U.S. at 143 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Although the inadvertency requirement does not further privacy rights, it protects an individual’s possessory interest in his or her property. Id. at 147. Accordingly, even though the observation or seizure of an article in plain view “would [not] involve any invasion of privacy . . . [a] seizure of the article . . . would obviously invade the owner’s possessory interest.” Id. at 133-34 (citations omitted). The need to protect such possessory interests in drugs, weapons, and other items “dangerous in themselves,” however, is not compelling. See Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 471; Slade, 116 N.H. at 439.', 'Retaining the inadvertency requirement for such items will not deter police misconduct, as the police have no incentive not to include such items for which they have probable cause. “If the officer has knowledge approaching certainty that the item will be found, we see no reason why he or she would deliberately omit a particular description of the item to be seized from the application for a search warrant,” as “[s]pecification of the additional item could only permit the officer to expand the scope of the search.” Horton, 496 U.S. at 138-39; see also 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 4.11(e), at 805-06 (4th ed. 2004) (noting that most plausible reason why police do not include item in warrant for which police have probable cause is “oversight or . . . an abundance of caution or . . . a misapprehension of what it takes to obtain a search warrant covering that evidence”).', 'Moreover, the warrant requirement provides “two distinct constitutional protections”: it eliminates searches not based upon probable cause by requiring the scrutiny of a detached and neutral magistrate; and it prevents “a general, exploratory rummaging in a person’s belongings” by requiring particularity. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 467. Although we abolish the inadvertency requirement for drugs, weapons, and other items dangerous in themselves, the initial intrusion under the plain view exception must still be justified by a warrant or an exception to the search warrant requirement. Id. “[G]iven the initial intrusion, the seizure of an object in plain view is consistent with [the particularity requirement], since it does not convert the search into a general or exploratory one.” Id. Eliminating inadvertency will not convert otherwise lawful searches into general exploratory searches, as all searches are already limited by search warrants or exceptions to the warrant requirement.

Id. at 293. The police obtained a search warrant for the defendants’ home, which authorized the seizure of seventeen specific items. Id. at 292-95.

Delaney, attorney general (Thomas E. Bocian, assistant attorney general, on the briefs and orally), for the State.', 'Paul Borchardt, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the briefs and orally, for the defendant.', 'HICKS, J. The defendant, Anthony Parker, appeals his convictions for aggravated felonious sexual assault and felonious sexual assault on two minors under the age of thirteen. See RSA 632-A:2, I(1) (2007); RSA 632-A:3, III (2007). On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court (Groff, J.) erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress; (2) denying his motion for a mistrial when a redacted portion of his interrogation was played to the jury; (3) permitting the State to ask him whether one of the complainants was lying; and (4) denying his motion to find a child witness incompetent to testify. We reverse and remand.', 'Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have found or the record supports the following. From 2004 to 2006, the defendant lived in Nashua with his former wife and two children, C.P. and A.P. In 2006, the couple separated, and the children moved with their mother to upstate New York to live with their grandmother. The children’s mother began to date another man whom the children started to call “Dad.” One evening at the dinner table, C.P. and A.P. told their grandmother that they had been sexually assaulted by the defendant. The children’s mother promptly reported this disclosure to New York authorities, sought a protective order against the defendant, and petitioned for full custody of the children in New York. The New York State police referred the case to the Nashua police.', 'In June 2007, a Nashua police detective called the defendant and asked him to come to the police station for an interview. The detective told the defendant that there was no active warrant for his arrest. The defendant, who had moved to Georgia to live with his mother, declined the request, stating that he did not have the money to travel to Nashua. In July, the detective renewed his interview request upon learning that the defendant would be in New York to attend a protective order hearing concerning the alleged assault of C.P. and A.P. Eventually, the defendant agreed to come to Nashua.', 'On July 11, after the hearing in New York, the defendant and his mother arrived at the Nashua police station. The police directed the defendant to a waiting room, permitted him to watch television, and served him a soda. The investigating officer, with whom the defendant had spoken on the phone, introduced himself to the defendant and led him to an interview room. Although the Nashua police already had obtained a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, he was not so informed before the interview.', 'The defendant was told that the interview would be audio- and video- recorded, and was then advised of his Miranda rights. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966). He stated that he understood his rights but wanted to waive them and to speak with the detective. He also signed a waiver form. The detective proceeded to question the defendant about his personal history, children, and relationship with his wife. After approximately two hours, the detective directed the interview to the alleged sexual assault of C.P. and A.P. He explained that forensic examiners had interviewed the two children about the assaults and determined that “[C.P.] and [A.P.] are telling the truth.” He next told the defendant that his children missed him and that he needed to repair his relationship with the children. The following exchange then occurred:', '[DETECTIVE:] If I saw two children that were distraught by this,', 'destroyed by this, hurt very badly by this, OK, I wouldn’t be here', 'talking to you. OK? I wouldn’t be here trying to work things with', 'you. OK? Because that’s a different source, different scenario,', 'different story. That’s not what we’re dealing with here. OK? This', 'is a very simple matter. OK? A very simple thing. OK? What you', 'tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and', 'you. OK? I know [your] mom’s here, OK? Um, and I know your', 'mom is very protective of you, right?', '[DEFENDANT:] Right.', '[DETECTIVE:] Ok. Um, what you tell me in here, OK, doesn’t have', 'to go to her. But I need you to be honest with me so that we can', 'move past and move forward and keep going. OK? . . . Um, and', 'I’m not bull . . . ting ya. I haven’t bull . . . t you all, any of the', 'time. I’m telling you the straight up truth.', 'After this exchange, the detective asked the defendant to discuss the specific events giving rise to the allegations of sexual assault. When the defendant was not immediately forthcoming, the detective interrupted to remind the defendant that the children had told the truth. The detective then said that he needed to hear the defendant admit that the children were telling the truth “before I can say hey, you know what? This is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. It’s all done. It’s behind him. You know? Get a little counseling and, and it’s over.” Shortly thereafter, the detective again stated, “And if you can’t tell me the scenario, that, you know, what happened and what was going through your mind at the time, OK, we can’t get [you] any counseling to fix the problem if you can’t give us some clue as to what the problem was.” The defendant then admitted to sexually assaulting C.P. and A.P. and the detective arrested him.', 'Before trial, the defendant filed several motions relevant to this appeal. He first moved to suppress his oral statements, arguing they were involuntary under the Due Process Clauses of the Federal and New Hampshire Constitutions. The State objected, arguing that there was “no evidence that the defendant’s will was overwrought [sic] by any comment that was made” by the detective. The trial court denied the motion.', 'After a hearing, the defendant argued that A.P., who was then five years old, was not competent to testify because A.P. did not appreciate the consequences of lying. The trial court disagreed, ruling that A.P had demonstrated “sufficient capacity to observe, remember, and narrate, as well as to understand the duty to tell the truth.” She was found competent to testify.', 'The defendant moved to sever the trials on the indictments concerning the two children. The trial court granted this motion, resulting in separate trials. Because of the severance, the parties agreed to redact the transcript of the defendant’s confession to omit any reference to the acts of sexual assault against A.P. at the trial for the sexual assault of C.P. These passages were blacked out with a marker. The parties also agreed to redact the video- recording of the confession by muting the sound.', 'The trial involving C.P. occurred first. During the detective’s testimony, the prosecution played the redacted video-recording and gave the jury the redacted transcript. At one point during the videotape, the defendant objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecution had not properly redacted the videotape and that the jury heard “with [A.P.] at least twice.” Based upon this statement, the defendant contended that the jury would infer that the defendant assaulted A.P., not just C.P. as alleged, and that the defendant discussed this assault in the redacted portions of the interrogation. The State maintained that the jury had heard nothing prejudicial and that the jury would infer only that A.P. may have witnessed the assault. The trial court denied the defendant’s request for a mistrial.', 'During his case, the defendant introduced evidence that his ex-wife’s new boyfriend had assaulted C.P. The defense pointed to the fact that C.P. called the new boyfriend “Dad.” The defense also elicited from C.P. that the boyfriend had shown C.P. his penis and “does nice things when he shows [C.P.] his penis.” Further, the defendant testified that he had never assaulted C.P.; he recanted his confession. He testified that the detective’s assertion that a forensic examiner had found his children to be truthful led him to believe that everyone would think he was guilty. For this reason, the detective’s promise that he would only have to attend counseling if he confessed sounded attractive, and, therefore, he confessed. Upon cross-examination, the State asked the defendant whether C.P. was lying. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the question impermissibly forced the defendant to judge the credibility of another witness. The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the defendant to respond. After two days of trial, the jury convicted the defendant of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault with a minor under the age of thirteen. See RSA 632-A:2, I(l).', 'Approximately one month later, the trial for the alleged sexual assault of A.P. was held. The defendant testified he had never assaulted A.P. and again recanted his confession. The jury, however, found the defendant guilty of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, see RSA 632-A:2, I(l), and two counts of felonious sexual assault with a minor under the age of thirteen, see RSA 632-A:3 III.', 'The defendant appealed his convictions involving C.P. and A.P. separately. Because both cases are interrelated and challenge the trial court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to suppress, we consider them together.', 'The defendant argues that his statements to the police were involuntary, and, therefore, their admission at both trials violated his due process rights under the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. See N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amend XIV. We first address the defendant’s arguments under the State Constitution and cite federal opinions for guidance only. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).', 'Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides that “[n]o subject shall be . . . compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against himself” and guarantees every citizen due process of law. N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. For a statement to be admissible at trial, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary. State v. Rezk, 150 N.H. 483, 486 (2004). Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact for the trial court to determine. State v. Hammond, 144 N.H. 401, 404 (1999). We will not reverse the trial court’s determination unless the manifest weight of the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the State is to the contrary. Rezk, 150 N.H. at 486.', 'The focus of our voluntariness inquiry is “whether the actions of an individual are the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.” Hammond, 144 N.H. at 405 (quotation omitted); State v. Damiano, 124 N.H. 742, 747 (1984). The decision to confess “must be freely self-determined.” In re Wesley B., 145 N.H. 428, 430 (2000) (quotation omitted). A confession cannot be “the product of a will overborne by police tactics, or of a mind incapable of a conscious choice.” Hammond, 144 N.H. at 405 (quotation omitted). Generally, we make a determination of voluntariness in light of “the totality of all the surrounding circumstances — both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.” Id.', 'Here, the defendant argues that his confession was involuntary because the interviewing detective made impermissible promises of confidentiality and leniency, respectively. The detective told the defendant that “[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.” Later, the detective stated, “[g]et a little counseling and . . . it’s over,” implying, according to the defendant, that if he confessed “he would only have to do counseling and that he would see his children”; “he would not have to go to jail.” The defendant contends that these promises “were so irresistible they rendered [his] confession involuntary.” The State counters that the detective’s statements were not promises of confidentiality or leniency. Moreover, relying principally upon Rezk, the State argues that “[i]n light of the totality of the circumstances,” including the detective’s statements, “the trial court correctly found . . . that the defendant’s statements were voluntary.”', 'In Rezk, we employed a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether a defendant’s confession was voluntary where a state agent had made an impermissible promise that was neither a promise of confidentiality nor a promise of immunity from prosecution. Rezk, 150 N.H. at 488. We stated:', 'Under the “totality of the circumstances” test, the existence of a', 'promise made to the defendant is not dispositive. Rather, all the', 'facts must be examined and their nuances assessed to determine', 'whether, in making the promise, the police exerted such an', 'influence on the defendant that his will was overborne. Id. (quotations omitted). To aid in this determination, we identified five factors that courts have considered, including: “(1) the nature of the promise; (2) the context in which it was made; (3) the characteristics of the individual defendant; (4) whether the defendant was informed of his Miranda rights; and (5) whether counsel was present.” Id. Nevertheless, we stated that “courts must give qualitative, rather than quantitative weight to the promise” when analyzing the impact a promise has on overbearing a defendant’s will. Id. (quotation omitted). “Even a single factor may inevitably lead to a conclusion that under the totality of circumstances a suspect’s will was overborne and the confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'The totality of the circumstances test, however, does not apply to promises of confidentiality or promises of immunity from prosecution. State v. McDermott, 131 N.H. 495, 501 (1989) (“A confession made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality or a promise of immunity is involuntary and coerced under the State Constitution.”); see Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487-88 (recognizing McDermott’s per se rule as to promises of confidentiality or promises of immunity even though McDermott cited the totality of the circumstances test).', 'In McDermott, we held a defendant’s confession involuntary where a federal drug enforcement agent made an impermissible promise of confidentiality. McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501. The agent told the defendant that information he provided about a murder “would not leave the office,” that the DEA “simply needed the information . . . to avoid surprises” at trial, and that the DEA would never obtain cooperation from informants if it prosecuted them with the information they provided. Id. at 499 (quotations omitted). He further told the defendant that his statements would not be used against him because he had never received his Miranda warnings. Id. We agreed with the trial court that these statements constituted impermissible promises of confidentiality and held the resulting confession involuntary. Id. at 501. We reasoned that “to allow the government to revoke its promise after obtaining incriminating information obtained in reliance on that promise would be to sanction governmental deception in a manner violating due process.” Id.', 'Our holding in Rezk did not supplant McDermott’s per se rule in favor of a totality of the circumstances test for promises of confidentiality and promises of immunity from prosecution. See Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487-88. In Rezk, we acknowledged that McDermott found such promises “categorically different” and “limited our per se rule of involuntariness to promises of confidentiality and promises of immunity from prosecution.” Id. at 487 (quotation omitted). For all other promises or threats, we examine the totality of the circumstances to determine “whether, in making the promise, the police exerted such an influence on the defendant that his will was overborne.” Id. at 488. For example, in Rezk, we analyzed the effect of a police officer’s promise of leniency on the voluntariness of the defendant’s confession under a totality of the circumstances test. Id. at 488-91. There, the defendant asked the interviewing officer “what was in it for him” if he cooperated. Id. at 485 (quotation omitted). The officer promised to not charge the defendant with the armed robberies that he allegedly committed two months previously and not to charge his associate. Id. Rather, the officer promised to charge the defendant only with the crimes he perpetrated the night of his arrest. Id. We held the resulting confessions involuntary because they “were induced by specific promises of leniency,” id. at 491, that had “the likelihood of stripping the defendant of his capacity for self- determination.” Id. at 489 (quotation and brackets omitted). The police officer “did more than merely exhort the defendant to be truthful” or promise to recommend leniency to the prosecutor if the defendant confessed. Id. at 490.', 'With these standards in mind, we analyze first whether the interviewing officer made an impermissible promise of confidentiality when he stated “[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you” and “what you tell me in here, OK, doesn’t have to go to [your mother].” The State urges us to uphold the trial court’s finding that while these statements “suggest an atmosphere of confidentiality,” they “could not reasonably be interpreted as a promise of confidentiality” under the totality of the circumstances. In support of this finding, the trial court noted that the defendant: (1) knew of the allegations of sexual assault; (2) indicated that he would turn himself in if an arrest warrant were issued; (3) knew that his former wife was seeking a restraining order and had driven to a hearing in New York concerning that order with his mother; and (4) traveled voluntarily to the Nashua police station. Therefore, the trial court reasoned, “it would have been naïve of the defendant to believe that what he told [the detective] would remain solely between him and [the detective]” because the defendant’s mother inevitably would learn of the sexual assault.', 'The trial court’s finding that the detective’s statements merely “suggested an atmosphere of confidentiality,” however, is against the manifest weight of the evidence. By focusing solely upon the context of the defendant’s statements, the trial court failed to properly consider the plain meaning of the detective’s statement. See Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487-91 (analyzing the plain meaning of the officer’s statements in addition to the nature and context of the statement to determine that specific promises of leniency were made); see also Knight v. State, 850 A.2d 1179, 1189 (Md. 2004) (requiring that a court first objectively determine whether the interrogating officer made an explicit or implicit threat, promise, or inducement). The detective’s statement “[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you” can reasonably be interpreted only one way — that what the defendant told the detective would be kept confidential. It is a promise of confidentiality. The detective’s subsequent statement that “what you tell me in here, OK, doesn’t have to go to [your mother]” is a further confirmation of this promise of confidentiality. The fact that the defendant knew of the allegations of sexual assault against him, that he voluntarily traveled to the Nashua police station, and that his mother likely knew of the assault allegations does not change the plain meaning of the detective’s statement.', 'Moreover, the detective’s promise of confidentiality here is almost identical to the promise of confidentiality made in McDermott. See McDermott, 131 N.H. at 497-99. In McDermott, the agent promised “that the information [the defendant] provided would not leave the office,” id. at 499 (quotation omitted), just as here the detective promised, “[w]hat you tell me . . . can stay between me and you.” The State attempts to distinguish McDermott, arguing that the detective here never implied or told “the defendant that his statements would not be used against him criminally,” as did the agent in McDermott. See id. at 499. To the contrary, however, that is the exact implication of the detective’s statement that “[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.” Indeed, the detective followed up this promise with the statement, “This is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. It’s all done. It’s behind him. You know? Get a little counseling and, and it’s over,” further indicating that the defendant would not be prosecuted criminally and only required counseling. The detective’s warning two hours earlier that “[a]nything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,” fulfilling the Miranda requirements, did not vitiate the detective’s later promise of confidentiality. The trial court erred in finding that the detective’s statement was not a promise of confidentiality. See McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501.', 'The State contends that even if the detective made a promise of confidentiality, the defendant did not rely upon it; therefore, his confession was voluntary. For a confession to be involuntary, we have stated that an interrogator’s promise must induce or cause the defendant to confess. State v. Carroll, 138 N.H. 687, 693 (1994); see McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501 (noting that a confession made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary). Here, the trial court found that “there is no indication that the defendant’s decision to confess was based upon [the detective’s] statements” because, in part, the defendant did not confess “immediately after” the detective’s statements.', 'The trial court’s finding that the defendant did not rely upon the detective’s promise of confidentiality is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Within ten minutes of the detective’s promise of confidentiality, the defendant admitted to the sexual assault of C.P. and then A.P. He had not made a single inculpatory statement during the previous two hours of the interview. Further, the majority of the intervening time is occupied by the detective talking and making statements such as, “I don’t want to hear bull . . . t. You know what, I, I don’t. I, cause to be honest, if you bull . . . t me, then I may change my impression of you and I may change my view of what happened, OK?”', 'This case is distinguishable from Carroll. In Carroll, the defendant was interviewed by a police officer and under pointed questioning admitted to stabbing the pregnant wife of one of his co-conspirators for payment. Carroll, 138 N.H. at 689, 693. After these admissions, the defendant stated, “I don’t want to go to prison,” to which the officer replied, “Then tell us the truth.” Id. at 692 (quotation omitted). The defendant then made further admissions. Id. We held that the officer’s statement did not induce the defendant’s confession; he had already confessed to several criminal acts and the same factors that motivated his earlier admissions, particularly his mother’s exhortations, induced his later admissions. Id. at 693. In contrast, here the defendant did not confess until after the detective’s promise of confidentiality. Moreover, the defendant’s confession here was not motivated by other factors, such as a private actor exhorting him to tell the truth or overwhelming physical evidence of his guilt. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Guarno, 819 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir. 1987) (defendant confessed because overwhelmed by evidence police had amassed). The trial court erred in finding that the officer’s statements did not induce the defendant to confess.', 'Because the interviewing detective made a promise of confidentiality that the defendant relied upon, we hold that the defendant’s resulting statement was involuntary. See McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501. The trial court’s contrary determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence as viewed in the light most favorable to the State. In light of our ruling that the defendant’s confessions were involuntary under the State Constitution, we need not address his arguments under the Federal Constitution. See Ball, 124 N.H. at 231-33.', 'The defendant next argues that, during the trial for the alleged assaults of C.P., the trial court erred in permitting the State to ask the defendant, during cross-examination, if the complainant was “lying.” See State v. Lopez, 156 N.H. 416, 423-24 (2007). At trial, the defendant took the stand and testified that he did not commit the alleged assaults. The following exchange occurred:', 'Q.', 'You heard [C.P.] testify today, right?', 'A.', 'Yes, I did.', 'Q.', 'Did you commit these crimes?', 'A.', 'No, I did not. Later, on cross-examination, the State asked, “And so today when your son, [C.P.], testified that [the defendant] made me put his penis in my mouth, he was lying? Yes or no?” Before the defendant could answer, his counsel objected, arguing that the question inadmissibly forced the defendant to opine on the credibility of another witness. The trial court overruled the objection, and required the defendant to answer. The prosecutor then renewed his question and the defendant responded, “Yes.”', 'We agree that these questions violated Lopez’s “broad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses.” Lopez, 156 N.H. at 424 (rejecting a case-by-case approach in favor of a broad prohibition). In Lopez, we found that the trial court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to ask the defendant “whether other witnesses had lied to the jury,” id. at 423, just as the court erred here in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant whether his son had lied. We reasoned that “such questioning interferes with the jury’s obligation to determine the credibility of witnesses, and is not probative in that it requires a witness to testify to things outside of her or his knowledge.” Id. We, therefore, held that “permitting the prosecutor to ask the defendant to opine upon the credibility of other witnesses [is] error.” Id. at 424.', 'The State invites us to limit Lopez by creating an exception when a defendant has opened the door by testifying about the veracity of another witness on direct examination. See, e.g., Daniel v. State, 78 P.3d 890, 904 (Nev. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1045 (2004). The State contends that “a defendant is not prejudiced by a question” about another witness’s credibility “[w]here, as here, the entire defense, including the direct examination of the defendant, is built upon the affirmative accusation that a victim-witness is lying.” A minority of six states have adopted this exception. See, e.g., State v. Pilot, 595 N.W.2d 511, 518 (Minn. 1999) (approving questions as to whether a witness was lying where “the focus of the defense was that the state’s witnesses were lying and that the evidence against him was fabricated as part of a vast conspiracy to convict him of a crime he did not commit”). We, however, decline the State’s invitation to join them. As we stated in Lopez, “we are persuaded by the majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue that rather than a case-by-case approach, a broad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses is the better law.” Lopez, 156 N.H. at 423-24.', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant to comment upon the credibility of another witness. The State asserts this error was harmless. Because we reverse and remand based upon the improperly admitted confession, we need not engage in further analysis.', 'Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court at his first trial erred in denying a mistrial after the jury heard testimony that should have been redacted and erred at the second trial in finding A.P. competent to testify. In light of our reversal on other grounds, we need not address these issues.', 'Reversed and remanded.', 'BRODERICK, C.J., and DALIANIS, DUGGAN and CONBOY, JJ., concurred. ']"

She appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by admitting certain evidence. We affirm.', 'I', 'The record supports the following. On February 24, 2006, Sergeant Shawn Gallagher of the Epping Police Department received two phone calls from the family of Kenneth Countie. They reported that their son had been taken from Wilmington, Massachusetts, by the defendant. Gallagher knew the defendant, having dealt with her approximately two dozen times since 1995.', 'Gallagher confirmed through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) that the Wilmington Police Department listed Countie as a missing person. At around 1:00 p.m., Gallagher and Detective Richard Cote went to the defendant’s home in Epping to check on Countie.', 'The defendant’s home was located on Red Oak Hill Lane, a public dirt road. The road continued through the defendant’s property, although there was a gate in front of the defendant’s home, that, when closed, blocked the road. On her property were a single-family dwelling with a barn, outbuildings, and pastureland. Her property was bordered by a fence, barbed wire, and the gate between her property and the road.', 'When the officers arrived at the defendant’s home, the gate was closed. They parked their cruiser outside the gate, and climbed through the gate’s rungs. They walked to the door and spoke with the defendant through a window. Gallagher asked if Countie was there, and the defendant said he was not. Gallagher told the defendant they had an NCIC report from Wilmington and asked again if Countie was present. The defendant then admitted he was. Gallagher asked if they could see Countie to check on his well-being. The defendant initially refused, saying Countie was naked and in the bathtub. She then left the window, however, and brought Countie to the door. Gallagher testified that Countie appeared “fine” and told the officers that he was there of his own free will. The defendant told the officers to leave her property, which they did.', 'On February 26, 2006, the defendant made three phone calls to Gallagher, stating that the police had no right to go onto her property, requesting a copy of the NCIC report that listed Countie as a missing person, and threatening to sue anyone who went onto her property again.', 'On March 17, 2006, Gallagher and Cote responded to a call that a suspicious person was acting disruptively inside the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Epping. When they arrived, they found the defendant with Countie, who was slumped over in a wheelchair. Countie’s skin was ashen, he had cuts on his face and hands, and one of his hands was swollen and not functioning normally. The defendant told Gallagher that Countie received his injuries in a car accident. When Cote attempted to speak with Countie, the defendant told Countie not to say anything to him. The officers accompanied the defendant and Countie out of the store, and Gallagher observed that Countie was leaning on a shopping cart and “not walking properly.” The defendant helped Countie into her truck.', 'On March 22, 2006, the defendant called Gallagher to complain that he had characterized her as a “suspicious person” in his report about the Wal- Mart incident. She also told him that Countie had left her house. The next day, Countie’s mother called Gallagher. She said she was concerned because the defendant had stated that Countie was no longer living with her, and Countie would have contacted someone if he were on his own. She also told Gallagher that her son could not be on his own because he had some “mental deficiencies since birth.” Gallagher and Cote called the defendant several times and left messages to find out where Countie was.', 'At approximately 1:00 a.m. on March 24, 2006, the defendant called Gallagher. She told him that Countie had left and then played a tape recording over the phone. On the tape, the defendant identified herself as a justice of the peace in New Hampshire and questioned Countie about raping children. Countie replied “yes” to the defendant’s questions in a soft, muffled voice. At the end of the tape, Gallagher heard a heaving sound, and the defendant told Countie to stop faking that he was “throwing up.” Then on the tape she said, “Kenneth Countie is now faking that he’s throwing up.” Shortly thereafter the defendant told Countie to stop faking that he fainted, and then said, “Kenneth Countie is now faking that he fainted.” While this tape was playing, Gallagher heard the defendant in the background “crying hysterically,” and saying “why, why, why?” Then the tape ended.', 'Concerned for Countie’s safety, Gallagher and Cote went to the defendant’s home at 6:00 p.m. Although the defendant had told them Countie was gone, the police went to her residence because in the past, she had had domestic disputes and told the police that the person had left, but the police later found the person there. When they arrived, the gate was closed but not locked. There were no lights on in the house and all of the defendant’s vehicles were parked in her yard. From outside the gate, Gallagher saw a burnt mattress in the front yard.', 'Gallagher and Cote climbed through the rungs of the gate and began walking toward the house. They passed the burnt mattress and a second burn pile. Using a flashlight to illuminate the pile, they saw what appeared to be a knife handle with a melted blade, tree limb clippers, a partially burnt chair, and a piece of bone. The bone was approximately three and a half inches long with a large piece of fleshy material attached to it.', 'The officers walked to the door and knocked several times, identifying themselves as Epping police officers. No one answered the door, so they returned to their cruiser. Gallagher was concerned that the bone was part of Countie’s remains. Gallagher called an assistant county attorney who told him he had sufficient evidence to conduct a “well-being check” concerning Countie.', 'Cote called for assistance and Officer Bradley Jardis responded. Officer Jardis took his patrol rifle from his cruiser and carried it pointing down in an “administrative carry,” and the three officers walked to the home. Gallagher knocked on the door while the other two officers banged on the side of the house and windows. When no one responded, they went back to the door and Gallagher kicked it open. Simultaneously, Gallagher heard a commotion and saw the defendant walking from the gate toward them.', 'The defendant told the officers that Countie was not there. Gallagher asked if they could go inside to check. The defendant invited them in and gave the officers a room-by-room tour of the house. Gallagher testified that she seemed “happy” as she gave the tour. In the basement, the officers found a pair of sneakers that the defendant said belonged to Countie. She told the officers they could not take them.', 'After the tour, the defendant and the officers walked outside. Cote asked the defendant about the bone. The defendant replied that it was from a rabbit and explained that she usually cremated her rabbits. When Cote observed that the bone was too big to have come from a rabbit, the defendant became agitated and said that it was from either “a rabbit or a pedophile.” Gallagher asked her why she said it was from a pedophile and the defendant denied that she had said that. The officers asked if they could take the bone, but the defendant refused. The defendant asked them to leave, which they did.', 'Based upon his observations on March 24, Gallagher obtained a warrant to search the exterior of the defendant’s home. Officers from the Epping Police Department and the New Hampshire State Police executed the search warrant on the morning of March 25, 2006. They seized several items and interviewed the defendant, who signed a consent-to-search form for her home.', 'On March 27, 2006, the defendant was interviewed by Sergeant Robert Estabrook and Chief Gregory Dodge of the Epping Police Department. During the interview, the defendant discussed the events of March 24. She told the officers that when she arrived home that night she found the police were already there and she let them inside her home. She described Officer Jardis as being quiet and did not mention he was carrying his firearm. At the end of the interview, she was released.', 'Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the physical evidence seized during searches of her home and property. She argued that the officers’ entries onto her property on February 24, 2006, and March 24, 2006, violated her state and federal constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures because the police entered her property without a warrant and no exceptions to the warrant requirement applied.', 'After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the court denied the motion. The court found that because the police “neither entered nor searched the defendant’s home” on February 24, the police did not violate the defendant’s constitutional rights. The court also found that the community caretaking and emergency aid doctrines justified the March 24 entry. The court further concluded that the “defendant freely, knowingly, and voluntarily consented to the search of her home.”', 'The defendant was indicted on one count of first-degree murder for the death of Kenneth Countie. She entered a non-negotiated plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and filed a notice of insanity defense. At the same time, she waived indictment and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to first-degree murder for the death of Michael DeLoge. The jury found her sane and guilty of both charges. This appeal followed.', 'On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the police entry onto her property on February 24. She argues, however, that the trial court erred in finding the officers’ actions on March 24 were justified under either the community caretaking or emergency aid exceptions to the warrant requirement. She also challenges the trial court’s finding that she voluntarily consented to the officers’ entry of her home that night. The State contends that the defendant waived her right to challenge the denial of her motion to suppress by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity and foregoing the guilt phase of the trial. Alternatively, the State argues that the community caretaking and emergency aid exceptions apply, and the defendant consented to the search of her home. We hold that the defendant did not waive her right to appeal, but that the search on March 24 was justified by the police’s community caretaking function and the defendant’s consent.', 'II', 'We first address the State’s argument that the defendant waived her right to appeal the trial court’s ruling on her motion to suppress. The State relies upon the acknowledgment and waiver of rights form the defendant signed before pleading not guilty by reason of insanity and the plea colloquy. Specifically, the State points to language in the acknowledgment of rights form which lists the constitutional rights a defendant gives up by pleading guilty, including the “RIGHT to appeal, if convicted.”', 'The defendant argues that she did not waive this right. Before she signed the form, defense counsel altered the form to clarify that the defendant was pleading “not GUILTY by reason of insanity” and that the waiver of rights was specifically limited to “the non-insanity issues/phase only.” Therefore, the defendant argues that she did not waive her right to appeal the admissibility of the evidence the State introduced to prove she was sane at the time she committed the murders. We agree.', 'When a defendant in a criminal case waives the right to appeal, it must be knowing and intelligent. See, e.g., United States v. Hahn, 359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 212 (2008); United States v. Andis, 333 F.3d 886, 890 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 997 (2003); United States v. Khattak, 273 F.3d 557, 561 (3d Cir. 2001). A knowing and intelligent waiver must be clear and unambiguous. See United States. v. Jones, 381 F.3d 615, 619 (7th Cir. 2004).', 'Here, the defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal was not unambiguous. The defendant’s alteration of the waiver form conveyed her intent to waive only the rights associated with the non-insanity or guilt phase. The motion to suppress, however, concerned evidence that was relevant to both the guilt and sanity phases of the trial. Accordingly, the defendant’s waiver of her right to appeal issues related to the guilt phase of the trial was insufficient to waive her right to appeal the trial court’s ruling on the motion to suppress. In addition, at the plea hearing there was no discussion by the court, and no acknowledgment by the defendant, that she was in any way giving up her right to appeal the ruling on the motion to suppress. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the defendant waived her right to appeal the trial court’s ruling on her motion to suppress.', 'III', 'Next, we address the defendant’s argument that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence and statements the police gathered as a result of an illegal search of her property. See N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 19; U.S. CONST. amend. IV. “Our review of the superior court’s order on a motion to suppress is de novo, except as to any controlling facts determined by the superior court.” State v. Denoncourt, 149 N.H. 308, 309 (2003). We first address the defendant’s claim under the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal cases only to aid in our analysis. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 232 (1983).', 'Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. “Under Part I, Article 19, . . . warrantless searches are per se unreasonable unless they fall within the narrow confines of a judicially crafted exception.” Denoncourt, 149 N.H. at 310. The State bears the burden of establishing that a search falls within one of these exceptions. Id. Here, the trial court found that the officers’ warrantless search of the defendant’s property on March 24 was justified by the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement. We agree.', 'We first adopted the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement in State v. Psomiades, 139 N.H. 480, 482 (1995). “Separate and apart from conducting criminal investigations,” police engage in community caretaking functions such as “helping stranded motorists, returning lost children to anxious parents, [and] assisting and protecting citizens in need.” State v. Seavey, 147 N.H. 304, 311 (2001) (Duggan, J. dissenting) (quotation omitted). “Evidence found in the course of caretaking activities is usually admissible at trial.” Denoncourt, 149 N.H. at 310.', 'We explained in State v. Boyle that, to justify a search under the community caretaking exception, the police officer', 'must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken', 'together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably', 'warrant the intrusion. We judge these facts by an objective', 'standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment of', 'the seizure warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that', 'the action taken was appropriate. State v. Boyle, 148 N.H. 306, 308 (2002) (quotation and citation omitted). “To determine whether the grounds for a particular [search] meet constitutional requirements, we balance the governmental interest that allegedly justified it against the extent of the intrusion on protected interests.” State v. Craveiro, 155 N.H. 423, 427 (2007). “[T]he [search] must be totally separate from the detection, investigation or acquisition of evidence relating to a criminal matter.” Id.; cf. State v. D’Amour, 150 N.H. 122, 126 (2003) (separation of community caretaking function from investigation of criminal matter “need only relate to a sound and independent basis for each role”).', 'The circumstances in this case justified police entry onto the defendant’s property under the community caretaking exception. Countie’s family made numerous phone calls to the Epping Police Department indicating concern for his safety because Countie could not care for himself. When the officers first met Countie on February 24, he appeared fine, but when they saw him on March 17, he was visibly injured. Furthermore, Countie’s mother stated that the defendant told her that Countie had left the defendant’s home to go to Massachusetts but he had not contacted his family, which was unusual for him.', 'The events of March 24 reinforced the possibility that Countie was injured. In the defendant’s phone call at 1:00 a.m., Countie could be heard vomiting on the audio tape and the defendant said he had fainted. Although the defendant told the officers and Countie’s family that he had left, the police had reason to believe she was lying. She had previously lied to the police when they went to her home on February 24 to see if Countie was there. The defendant initially told them he was not there but then brought him to the door. The officers also knew that the defendant had a history of arguing with partners who left her home but returned later. All of these facts were enough to cause “a person of reasonable caution” to believe that Countie might have been injured and at the defendant’s residence. See Boyle, 148 N.H. at 308.', 'The record also demonstrates that the police entered the defendant’s property to check on Countie’s well-being, not to investigate a crime. When they pulled up to the defendant’s gate on March 24, they had no reason to suspect that a crime had been committed. D’Amour, 150 N.H. at 126. Given the circumstances outlined above, however, the police had reason to believe that Countie could be injured. The officers’ concerns for Countie’s well-being, and the likelihood that he was still at the defendant’s home, outweighed the intrusion onto the defendant’s property. See Craveiro, 155 N.H. at 427. Therefore, police entry onto the defendant’s property on March 24 was justified under the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement.', 'Because we find that the officers’ actions were justified under the community caretaking exception we need not consider the State’s argument that the emergency aid exception applied. We also need not address the State’s argument that the police were justified in forcibly opening the door to the defendant’s home under the community caretaking exception because the police did not enter the defendant’s home at that point and their actions did not lead to the seizure of any evidence.', 'IV', 'We next consider whether the defendant consented to the officers’ entry into her home on March 24. The defendant argues her consent was invalid because: (1) her consent was vitiated by the unlawful police entry onto her property; and (2) she was intimidated by the three officers, one with a gun, who had just forcibly opened her door. As discussed above, however, her first argument fails because the entry was lawful. The State counters that the defendant’s interactions with the police that evening demonstrate that she voluntarily consented to the search of her house. We agree.', 'Like community caretaking, a “voluntary consent free of duress and coercion is a recognized exception to the need of both a warrant and probable cause.” State v. Johnston, 150 N.H. 448, 453 (2004) (quotation omitted). The State must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant’s “consent was free, knowing and voluntary.” Id. “Voluntariness is a question of fact, based on the totality of the circumstances.” State v. Watson, 151 N.H. 537, 540 (2004). “We will disturb the trial court’s finding of consent only if it is not supported by the record.” Id.', 'The trial court concluded that the evidence “show[ed] that the defendant was not . . . threatened, frightened, intimidated or coerced into giving consent.” This finding is supported by the record. Gallagher testified that Officer Jardis “held the weapon in an administrative carry, pointing at the ground,” and the defendant described Jardis as “quiet” in her interview with police on March 27. Moreover, in that same interview, the defendant told Dodge that she “let [the officers] in.” Finally, when Gallagher stood with the defendant on the porch and she said Countie was not there, he asked her if the officers could go inside and check. The defendant, without hesitation, invited them in.', 'In addition, the defendant was familiar with the police and the officers testified that she had been assertive with them in the past. On March 24, the defendant refused to let the police take Countie’s sneakers or the bone from the burn pile, and when the defendant told the police to leave, they did. Based upon the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that the defendant freely, knowingly and voluntarily consented to the search of her home. Accordingly, the trial court’s finding that the defendant consented to the search of her home is supported by the record and will not be disturbed. Watson, 151 N.H. at 540.', 'Because the State Constitution provides at least as much protection as the Federal Constitution under these circumstances, see Boyle, 148 N.H. at 307, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.', 'Affirmed.', 'BRODERICK, C.J., and DALIANIS, HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

Delaney, attorney general (Thomas E. Bocian, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Stephanie Hausman, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'DALIANIS, J. The defendant, Katherine Mendola, was convicted by a jury of criminal solicitation to commit murder, see RSA 629:2 (2007); RSA 630:1 (2007). On appeal, she argues that the Superior Court (Nadeau, J.) erred when it failed to instruct the jury on entrapment, excluded evidence that her sometimes boyfriend had abused her, and admitted evidence that she wanted two additional people to be killed. We affirm.', 'The jury could have found the following facts. The woman the defendant sought to have killed was the wife of her workers’ compensation lawyer. She first hired this attorney in late 2004 or early 2005. Over time, she developed romantic feelings for him, which she expressed by calling him repeatedly and by saying inappropriate things to him, such as referring to her cleavage, describing herself as “young,” “hot,” and “sexy,” and telling him that she would make “the best wife in the whole wide world.” Between September 1 and November 1, 2007, the defendant called her attorney 458 times. In one of her many visits to his office, the defendant embraced him and told him that she wanted to have a romantic relationship with him. Although he demurred, the defendant told others that they had kissed.', 'The defendant talked about her attorney to her friends “all the time,” telling them that she loved him and wanted to marry him. She said that her attorney yearned to be with her, but that he did not want to disrupt his marriage. The defendant then sought to break up her attorney’s marriage. At first, she tried magic spells that she ordered from witchcraft websites. When these did not work, she sought to hire someone to kill her attorney’s wife.', 'She first asked T. Thomas Austin, who lived at the same campground as the defendant. In the summer of 2007, she twice asked Austin to “eliminate” her attorney’s wife because she was in love with her attorney and wanted to marry him. Austin declined. She then asked Daniel Cloutier, with whom she sometimes lived, if he knew of someone who could do the job. Although Cloutier initially did not take the defendant seriously, he became concerned that she might be capable of hurting someone when she threatened him with a knife because he left a mess in the bathroom.', 'Cloutier contacted agents from the drug task force for the New Hampshire Attorney General in October 2007. Ten years earlier, he had been an informant for the task force for approximately one year. Cloutier told two task force agents that he had a roommate who wanted to hire an assassin to kill the wife of a man with whom she was having an affair. The agents spoke with the state police, and, as a result, State Trooper Christopher Huse was assigned to pose as a hit man. Huse first met with Cloutier, who told him that the defendant was his roommate and that she wanted a hit man to kill her attorney’s wife. Huse told Cloutier to tell the defendant that he knew someone who would contact her about the job. The defendant seemed “overjoyed” when Cloutier told her this.', 'On November 16, 2007, Huse called the defendant, posing as a hit man, and asked if she were still interested in his services, to which she said, “Yes, I am.” When the defendant told Huse that she’d rather talk in person, he told her that they would meet in New Hampshire and that he would call her when he was “ready.” Huse told the defendant that “business is gonna be taken care of,” to which she said, “I appreciate that,” and laughed.', 'Huse called the defendant again on November 19, 2007. The defendant told him that nobody knew “about this” except Cloutier and that when she and Huse met she was planning to wear “a hood and sunglasses so [she wouldn’t] be recognizable.” She told Huse that where they were going for the hit was within a twenty-minute ride from Manchester, but was “out in the middle of nowhere so nobody is gonna see nothing.” She told Huse not to worry because she had “directions to where we’re going” and that she had “thought, like, ten steps ahead here.” Huse asked the defendant if she still “want[ed] to do this,” to which she replied, “I’m very serious about this.” They agreed to meet that afternoon in Manchester.', 'Later that day, Huse and the defendant met in the parking lot of a Wendy’s restaurant in Manchester. The defendant told Huse that she thought this was “funny” because “[t]he name of [the wife] is Wendy.” The defendant told Huse that she’d “been waiting for this for five years.” When Huse asked why she had not hired him earlier, she said: “I just found out about you . . . . If I had known about you a year ago, . . . I would have jumped on this sooner.” She explained that she had been asking Cloutier for a month to “get this done.”', 'The defendant further explained that she “kn[e]w what [she was] doing” because she had talked to a well-known psychic who had told her: “You need to get rid of this woman. I’m not going to tell you specifically how. You know how. You need to get rid of her.” When Huse again asked the defendant if this was what she wanted to do, she said that she was a “hundred and million percent” sure that it was.', 'The defendant reiterated that she “want[ed] this done really bad,” explaining, “I want [the wife] out so that I [can] get married and I am in a lot better situation and . . . he has money and . . . [h]e wants to be with me. He doesn’t want her. She sucks his money, and, you know, she needs to go.” The defendant said that “when things settle down” and her attorney “gets over all . . . that’s just happened,” she would “move in with him.” She told Huse that when she married her attorney, she would be able to pay Huse more. The defendant told Huse that she was “going [to] reward [him] handsomely” and that she had “a thousand dollars in cash for [him] to get the job done.” Huse explained that a thousand dollars might suffice if the defendant merely wanted Wendy to be hurt, to which the defendant replied: “I want her dead.” Huse explained that for a killing, the defendant would need to pay him an additional three or four thousand dollars, to which the defendant said: “I got ya.” She told Huse that she could give him a thousand dollars now, but that “[t]he guy’s a lawyer. He’s got to be cool. . . . He doesn’t know about this. . . . When things go the way I want them to go, she’s going to be out, I’m going to be in. I can have more money for you later.” Huse repeated: “I just want to make sure that we’re on [t]he same page. . . . That this first payment of the thousand dollars to kill her isn’t just the only payment; there’s going to be more.” The defendant agreed.', 'Huse asked the defendant whether there was “[a]nything specific that [she] want[ed],” to which she replied: “I want her dead and I want it to look like an accident . . . . ” She explained that her attorney’s wife “needs to die. . . . She can’t be like hurt or injured or like in a hospital. She needs to be down and out.” She suggested that Huse “yell out, ‘Wendy,’ to see if she turns,” and then “shoot her.” She told Huse that her attorney “usually leaves work around 3:00, 3:30,” so that the “best time to do it” was “in the morning.” She suggested that Huse “somehow stalk” her attorney’s wife and “figure out when she leaves the house every day or wait for her to come out of the house . . . [a]nd then you got to shoot her.” When Huse asked whether the defendant wanted the woman to be shot in the chest or the head, the defendant said: “The head’s the best because . . . . [p]eople rarely survive head shot gun wounds. . . . We want her gone, so do it in the head, if you can.”', 'The defendant then expressed her concern that, because she called her attorney’s office “all the time” and wrote love letters to him, she could be a suspect in his wife’s death. She explained that she hoped that Huse would tell her “when this is going to take place” so that she could “hop on a plane and go down to Florida and disappear for [a] while.”', 'After the defendant met with Huse, she returned to her home and told Cloutier, excitedly, “[I]t’s definitely going down.” Some days later, Huse called the defendant and asked her to meet him so that she could identify her attorney’s wife in a photo that he had obtained. Huse and the defendant agreed to meet in Milford, where the police arrested her.', 'At trial, defense counsel told the jury in his opening statement that this case was about “the control carefully, methodically and purposely” wielded over the defendant by Cloutier. The defendant’s theory of the case, as explained in defense counsel’s opening statement, was that Cloutier physically, verbally and sexually abused her for many years, and then, because he wanted to be rid of her, set her up to be arrested for solicitation of murder. “Comply or die,” is what defense counsel said Cloutier told the defendant. But for Cloutier’s “abuse, . . . threats and . . . manipulati[on],” the defendant “would not have stepped into [Huse’s] truck.” As defense counsel explained, the defendant “was not predisposed to do this. She only did it because she was forced to comply or die.” Consistent with this theory, the defendant testified that Cloutier told her that he would kill her if she did not do as he said. She testified that Cloutier told her that he wanted to be rid of her and “was going to be an informant and set [her] up with the drug task force.”', 'The defendant first argues that the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on entrapment. We review the trial court’s decision not to give a jury instruction for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. State v. Ayer, 154 N.H. 500, 514 (2006), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 834 (2007). To prevail, the defendant must show that the trial court’s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. State v. Duran, 158 N.H. 146, 150 (2008). We will search the record for evidence supporting the defendant’s requested jury instruction. State v. Balliro, 158 N.H. 1, 5 (2008).', 'For a defendant to be entitled to an instruction on a specific defense, there must be some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense. Duran, 158 N.H. at 150. “‘Some evidence’ means more than a minutia or scintilla of evidence.” Id. (quotation omitted). “To be more than a scintilla, evidence cannot be vague, conjectural, or the mere suspicion about the existence of a fact, but must be of such quality as to induce conviction.” Id. (quotation omitted). “Where there is simply no evidentiary basis to support the theory of the requested jury instruction, the party is not entitled to such an instruction, and the trial court may properly deny the party’s request.” Balliro, 158 N.H. at 5 (quotation and ellipsis omitted).', 'Entrapment is an affirmative defense, upon which the defendant bears the burden of proof:', 'It is an affirmative defense that the actor committed the', 'offense because he was induced or encouraged to do so by a law', 'enforcement official or by a person acting in cooperation with a law', 'enforcement official, for the purpose of obtaining evidence against', 'him and when the methods used to obtain such evidence were', 'such as to create a substantial risk that the offense would be', 'committed by a person not otherwise disposed to commit it.', 'However, conduct merely affording a person an opportunity to', 'commit an offense does not constitute entrapment. RSA 626:5 (2007). To be entitled to an instruction on this defense, a defendant must point to “some evidence” that: (1) law enforcement officials induced or encouraged the defendant to commit the offense; and (2) the defendant was not predisposed to engage in it. State v. Larose, 157 N.H. 28, 35 (2008).', 'We begin by addressing the first prong of the defense -- inducement. Inducement is something more than “merely affording a person an opportunity to commit an offense.” RSA 626:5; see Larose, 157 N.H. at 35. Rather, “[a]n inducement consists of an ‘opportunity’ plus something else – typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government’s taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.” Larose, 157 N.H. at 36 (quotation omitted).', 'Here, even if we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, we fail to find “some evidence” that would support a rational finding that the defendant was induced by law enforcement to commit the charged offense. There was no evidence that Huse did anything other than offer his services to the defendant. “An inducement, by its very nature, contemplates more than a request and an affirmative response.” Id. at 35 (quotation omitted). “It is more than a solicitation. It is more even than a successful solicitation.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'While the defendant argues that Cloutier threatened her, his acts could only possibly constitute inducement if they occurred during the very brief period of time in which he acted as a government agent. See Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 373-74 (1958); RSA 626:5. At most, Cloutier acted as a government agent when, at Huse’s direction, he told the defendant that he had talked with a hitman from whom she should expect a call. The only evidence that, during this specific period of time, Cloutier in any way threatened the defendant came from her own self-serving account. The defendant failed to produce any corroborating evidence about the abuse. The defendant’s testimony, standing alone, does not constitute “some evidence” to support her requested instruction. See Larose, 157 N.H. at 33. A court need not give weight to allegations that are intrinsically improbable or flatly contradicted by irrefutable evidence. Id. Moreover, conclusory and self-serving statements, standing alone, do not suffice. Id. “[A] defendant’s account, although self-serving, may have weight if it is interlaced with considerable detail and has some circumstantial corroboration in the record.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'The defendant’s failure to produce “some evidence” that she was induced to commit the charged offense by law enforcement officials is fatal to her claim that she was entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment. Accordingly, we need not address the sufficiency of the defendant’s proof that she was not predisposed to commit the charged offenses. See id. at 38.', 'The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce evidence that she would “love” to hire Huse in the future to kill two other people: her biological father and another woman whom she disliked. The defendant argues that the trial court’s ruling violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b).', 'Although the State argues that the defendant failed to preserve this argument for our review because her motion in limine cited Rule 404(a), instead of Rule 404(b), we disagree. The text of the defendant’s motion and the transcript of the hearing upon it make clear that she raised her argument under Rule 404(b) and cited Rule 404(a) by mistake.', 'Rule 404(b) provides:', 'Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to', 'prove the character of a person in order to show that the person', 'acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for', 'other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,', 'preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or', 'accident. We have established a three-part test for the admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b): (1) the evidence must be relevant for a purpose other than proving the defendant’s character or disposition; (2) there must be clear proof that the defendant committed the act; and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its prejudice to the defendant. State v. Beltran, 153 N.H. 643, 647 (2006). The State bears the burden of demonstrating the admissibility of other bad acts. Id. We review the trial court’s ruling for an unsustainable exercise of discretion, and will reverse only if it was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant’s case. Id. The defendant challenges the trial court’s decision with respect to the first and third prongs.', 'To meet its burden under the first prong, the State is required to specify the purpose for which the evidence is offered and articulate the precise chain of reasoning by which it will tend to prove or disprove an issue actually in dispute, without relying upon forbidden inferences of predisposition, character, or propensity. Id. To be relevant, other bad acts must be in some significant way connected to material events constituting the crime charged and not so remote in time as to eliminate the nexus. Id. at 647-48. Here, the challenged evidence was relevant not only to rebut the defendant’s entrapment defense, but also to establish that she possessed the requisite criminal intent to commit the charged crime.', 'The contested evidence was specifically relevant to show that the defendant, contrary to her assertions, was predisposed to commit the crime of criminal solicitation. See United States v. Santiago, 566 F.3d 65, 71-72 (1st Cir.) (prior conviction of possession of cocaine admissible to rebut entrapment defense to drug possession charge), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 338 (2009). While the defendant contends that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce the challenged evidence during its case-in-chief before the defendant could present sufficient evidence of her entrapment defense, we agree with the State that this argument is not preserved for our review, and decline to address it.', 'The contested evidence was also relevant to show that the defendant possessed the required criminal intent for criminal solicitation, which is that she acted purposely. RSA 629:2, I. “A person acts purposely . . . when [her] conscious object is to cause the result or engage in the conduct that comprises” the offense. RSA 626:2, II(a) (2007). Evidence that the defendant sought to hire Huse to kill other people tended to show that when she hired Huse to kill her attorney’s wife, she did so with the purpose of having her attorney’s wife killed. This evidence showed that she did not solicit Huse to kill her attorney’s wife only because, as she claimed, Cloutier forced her to do so, but because she personally wanted the wife to be killed, just as she wanted two other people whom she disliked to be killed.', 'Under the third prong, evidence of other bad acts is admissible if the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Beltran, 153 N.H. at 649. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury’s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, or provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision upon something other than the established propositions in the case. Id. It is not, however, evidence that is merely detrimental to the defendant because it tends to prove guilt. Id. We accord considerable deference to the trial court’s determination in balancing prejudice and probative worth under Rule 404(b). Id. To prevail, the defendant must show that the trial court’s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. Id.', 'Here, in light of the defendant’s entrapment defense and her theory that, but for Cloutier’s abuse and threats, she lacked the requisite criminal intent to commit the charged crime, we cannot say that the trial court unreasonably balanced the prejudicial effect and probative worth of evidence that the defendant asked Huse to kill people other than her attorney’s wife. In the context of this case, this evidence was highly probative both because it rebutted the defendant’s entrapment defense and because it established that she, in fact, had the requisite criminal intent. Even though the evidence was prejudicial, the defendant has not shown that the trial court erred in concluding that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.', 'Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court erred when it precluded her from introducing evidence that Cloutier abused her. We defer to the trial court in determining the admissibility of evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. State v. Dodds, 159 N.H. 239, 250 (2009). We will not reverse its decision unless the defendant demonstrates that it was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. Id. at 251. The record reveals that the trial court, in fact, allowed the defendant to testify, at length, about Cloutier’s alleged abuse. While the trial court precluded the defendant from presenting witnesses to testify that she told them that Cloutier abused her, the defendant has failed to show that this decision was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. We decline to address the defendant’s assertion that the trial court’s decision violated her constitutional right to present all proofs favorable, see N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amend. VI, because she did not brief this argument sufficiently for our review. See State v. Blackmer, 149 N.H. 47, 49 (2003).', 'Affirmed.', 'BRODERICK, C.J., and DUGGAN and HICKS, JJ., concurred. ']"

Delaney, attorney general (Nicholas Cort, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Lisa L. Wolford, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'HICKS, J. The defendant, Robinson Garcia, was certified as an adult and convicted of one count of second-degree murder, see RSA 630:1-b, I(b) (2007), and one count of riot, see RSA 644:1, I (2007). On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court (O’Neill, J.) erroneously: (1) denied his motions to suppress; (2) excluded the testimony of a defense witness; and (3) prohibited him from testifying about statements made by the victim. We affirm.', 'The defendant’s convictions arise out of the August 11, 2005 beating of Stephen Raymond in Manchester. After Raymond’s death in 2006, the defendant was charged with second-degree murder, in that, acting in concert with Larry Barbosa, he caused the death of Raymond under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life by striking Raymond in the head with a baseball bat. The defendant was also charged with three alternative theories of felony-level riot, alleging that he assembled with others with the purpose of causing Raymond to suffer serious injuries.', 'The trial court made a number of rulings unfavorable to the defendant. First, it denied his motions to suppress statements he made to the Manchester police that he claimed were obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Next, at trial, it excluded testimony of a defense witness regarding statements made by co-defendant Barbosa implicating himself in Raymond’s death. Finally, it excluded on hearsay grounds testimony by the defendant of statements made to him by the victim. The defendant appeals these rulings. We address each of the defendant’s arguments in turn. I.', 'Suppression', 'On August 17, 2005, Sergeant James Flanagan of the Manchester Police Department received a telephone call from the defendant’s mother, Marisol Gonzalez, who said that she believed her son, then sixteen years old, was involved in Raymond’s beating. Shortly thereafter, Flanagan and Detective Michael Biron went to Gonzalez’s home to speak with her. Both officers were wearing plain clothes and a side-arm with a visible badge.', 'Gonzalez told the officers that, on the day of the beating, the defendant left the house with Randal Rodriguez after being informed by a group of children that a fight was about to occur. She later realized a red baseball bat was missing from her porch. The defendant returned approximately fifteen minutes later, immediately changed his clothes and did not leave the house for three days. Several days later she spoke with him about what had happened that day, and he told her there had been a “little fight” but did not provide her with any details.', 'While the officers were there, Gonzalez telephoned the defendant’s girlfriend’s house and was told that the defendant was at Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown. The officers thereafter drove an unmarked police cruiser to Bear Brook State Park, where they found the defendant on the beach preparing to go for a canoe ride with a group of people. They introduced themselves and told the defendant that they would like to speak with him. The defendant “agreed readily” and walked with the officers approximately twenty feet away from the group.', 'The officers then asked the defendant if he knew why they wanted to speak with him, and he indicated that he did not. They explained that they were investigating Raymond’s beating, that they had spoken with his mother, and they understood that he might have some information. They then read him his Miranda rights, using a simplified form for juveniles known as a Benoit form, see State v. Benoit, 126 N.H. 6, 22-24 (1985). Flanagan reviewed each portion of the form with the defendant, who initialed each portion and indicated that he understood. He also indicated that he understood the waiver of rights portion of the form and that he was willing to speak with the officers.', 'The defendant told the officers that on the day of the beating, some children came to his house and told him there was a problem involving an older man and the defendant’s brother. He left his house with an aluminum baseball bat to find out what was going on. When he arrived at the scene, an older man confronted him; however, after learning that his brother was not involved, he left and returned home. Later that day, another group of children came to his house and told him there was about to be a fight. He again left his house with a baseball bat. This time he was confronted by an older man who challenged him to fight. The defendant said that as he was being challenged, a group of people attacked the man. The defendant then threw his bat down and ran away.', 'Flanagan falsely told the defendant that an area resident had videotaped the altercation, which would enable the police “to find out who did exactly what.” The defendant then said that he had used the bat defensively, making “check swings,” before running away, but that he did not know who hit the victim with the bat.', 'After approximately twenty minutes, the officers asked the defendant if he would go to the police station to continue to speak with them. He agreed on the condition that he be allowed to return to Bear Brook State Park. The officers told him that they would call his mother “and see if she wants to be present when we talk to you, and you can ask her. It will be up to her.” The defendant “seemed completely satisfied” and agreed to go with the officers. At no time did the officers ask the defendant if he would like to consult with his mother or any other interested adult.', 'Upon arriving at the police station, the officers escorted the defendant to an interview room in the juvenile unit. Flanagan testified that he called Gonzalez and asked her if she wanted to come to the police station and take part in the interview. He testified that Gonzalez said “no . . . just give me a call when you’re done,” and that she gave him permission to speak with the defendant.', 'The officers again reviewed a Benoit form line by line with the defendant and asked if he understood. He read the waiver portion of the form out loud and “seemed to have a complete understanding as to what [the officers] were asking him.” He waived his rights and initialed the form accordingly. Throughout the interview, the defendant maintained his version of the events. At one point, the officers took a five-to-ten-minute break and left the defendant in the interview room. When they returned, they questioned him “a little stronger” about inconsistencies in his version of events. At this point, he told the officers that he realized they did not believe him and that he had nothing further to say. The officers then concluded the interview and arrested the defendant. The entire interview at the police station lasted about one hour.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that his statements were obtained in violation of his right against self-incrimination under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Specifically, he alleges that he was in custody for Miranda purposes at Bear Brook State Park once the officers told him they wanted to speak with him and that he did not waive his constitutional rights in conformity with Benoit and State v. Farrell, 145 N.H. 733 (2001). We first address the defendant’s claims under the State Constitution and look to federal cases only to aid in our analysis. State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).', 'The New Hampshire Constitution provides that “[n]o subject shall be . . . compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against himself.” N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. Thus, “to overcome the presumption that a defendant would not normally forfeit this constitutional protection, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived this right.” Farrell, 145 N.H. at 736. As the trial court is in the best position to weigh the credibility of witnesses, we will not reverse a trial court’s finding on the issue of waiver “unless the manifest weight of the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, is to the contrary.” Id. (quotation omitted); see also State v. Plch, 149 N.H. 608, 617 (2003).', 'In Benoit, we addressed the capacity of juveniles to waive their rights and ruled that a totality of the circumstances approach should be used to determine whether a juvenile has validly done so. Benoit, 126 N.H. at 15-17. We adopted a fifteen-factor test for trial courts to utilize when evaluating a juvenile’s purported waiver:', '(1) the chronological age of the juvenile; (2) the apparent mental', 'age of the juvenile; (3) the educational level of the juvenile; (4) the', 'juvenile’s physical condition; (5) the juvenile’s previous dealings', 'with the police or court appearances; (6) the extent of the', 'explanation of rights; (7) the language of the warnings given; (8)', 'the methods of interrogation; (9) the length of interrogation; (10)', 'the length of time the juvenile was in custody; (11) whether the', 'juvenile was held incommunicado; (12) whether the juvenile was', 'afforded the opportunity to consult with an adult; (13) the', 'juvenile’s understanding of the offense charged; (14) whether the', 'juvenile was warned of possible transfer to adult court; and (15)', 'whether the juvenile later repudiated the statement. Id. at 15. We ultimately concluded that:', 'before a juvenile can be deemed to have voluntarily, knowingly and', 'intelligently waived his or her fundamental constitutional rights', 'under part I, article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, (1) he', 'or she must be informed, in language understandable to a child, of', 'his or her rights, (2) the court must review and make findings on', 'each of the factors enumerated . . . above surrounding the giving of', 'the statement, (3) the judge . . . must be persuaded by an adequate', 'number of favorable findings that the waiver was made voluntarily,', 'intelligently and with full knowledge of the consequences, and (4),', 'if facing charges that would constitute a felony if committed by an', 'adult, the juvenile must be informed of the consequences of a', 'certification to stand trial as a criminal defendant. Id. at 18-19.', 'Assuming, without deciding, that the defendant was in custody at Bear Brook State Park when the officers said they wanted to speak to him, we hold that the trial court’s finding of a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver is not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.', 'The defendant does not dispute that a simplified juvenile Miranda form, which included the warning that he could be certified as an adult, was twice used. Rather, he argues that “there were an insufficient number of findings to support the trial court’s determination that” he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his right against self-incrimination. We disagree. The trial court made findings on each of the above-enumerated factors, at least twelve of which indicated that the defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights.', 'The trial court found that the defendant was less than two months away from his seventeenth birthday (factor one) and that the evidence did not support a finding that his apparent mental age or educational level were inconsistent with that of a sixteen year old (factors two and three). The court further found that the defendant did not allege that anything was wrong with his physical condition (factor four). While the court noted that the defendant had no prior dealings with the police or court appearances, it found that Flanagan twice reviewed a Benoit form with him, and answered any questions he had regarding the form (factors six and seven). The court noted that Flanagan lied to the defendant about having a videotape of the altercation; however, it found that the interrogation was generally cordial (factor eight). Indeed, Flanagan testified that the tenor of the interview was “pretty cordial” and even when they decided to question the defendant “a little stronger,” the interview did not “get out of hand or completely aggressive or anything.” The trial court further found that the length of the entire custodial interrogation was over an hour (factors nine and ten) and the defendant was not held incommunicado (factor eleven).', 'The court found that the defendant understood the offense charged, noting that Flanagan and Biron explained why they wanted to speak with the defendant (factor thirteen). Further, it found that the defendant was warned of possible transfer to adult court through the use of two Benoit forms that indicated that if his case was transferred to adult court, he would have to go through the adult criminal system and, as a result, he could go to the county jail or state prison (factor fourteen). The court also found that the defendant did not later repudiate his statement (factor fifteen).', 'The defendant points to factor eleven and argues that he was effectively sequestered while the officers obtained his statements. The record, however, does not support the defendant’s argument. Here, the officers initially spoke with the defendant outside, in a public setting, at Bear Brook State Park. At no time was he prevented from speaking with a lawyer, his mother or any other interested adult. Moreover, at no time was the defendant’s mother denied the opportunity to speak with him. Cf. Farrell, 145 N.H. at 739 (finding defendant’s Miranda waiver invalid where the police did not cease interrogating the defendant after his father arrived at the police station and requested to see the defendant and did not inform the defendant that his father wanted to speak with him or make any effort to allow the defendant’s father into the interview room). Indeed, Flanagan testified that had Gonzalez wanted to attend the interview, he would have “welcomed her into the interview” and “waited for her to get there before [they] interviewed” the defendant.', 'The defendant also points to factor twelve and argues that he “was not afforded the opportunity to consult with an adult at either Bear Brook State Park or the Manchester Police Department.” In Farrell, we made clear that when considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding a juvenile waiver, “the absence of an opportunity to consult with an adult shall be given greater weight.” Id. at 738. However, we “express[ed] no opinion whether this failure alone tips the scale in favor of the defendant under a totality of the circumstances analysis.” Id. at 739.', 'In this case, the trial court found that it “was not the officers’ fault” that the defendant did not have the opportunity to consult with an adult because the defendant’s “mother declined to come to the police station.” This was an improper analysis of whether the defendant was afforded the opportunity to consult with an adult. Under this factor, the question is whether the juvenile was afforded the opportunity to consult with an adult. See id. at 738. Here, while Flanagan testified that he called Gonzalez to see if she wanted to come to the police station and take part in the interview, at no time was the defendant informed that he could consult with Gonzalez or another interested adult. Nonetheless, in light of the remaining number of favorable findings that the defendant’s waiver was made voluntarily, intelligently and with full knowledge of the consequences, we cannot say that the trial court’s finding that the defendant’s waiver was valid in this case was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.', 'We intend no erosion of our holding in Farrell as to the weight to be given the absence of an opportunity to consult with an adult when assessing the totality of the circumstances surrounding a juvenile waiver. See id. Indeed, there may be circumstances in which the failure of the police to afford the juvenile the opportunity to consult with an adult may tip the scale in favor of the defendant under a totality of the circumstances analysis. Here, however, we cannot say that this failure rendered the defendant’s Miranda waiver invalid.', 'Because the Federal Constitution is no more protective of the defendant than the State Constitution under these circumstances, see id. at 736; Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 168-69 (1986) (State need prove waiver of Miranda protections only by a preponderance of the evidence), we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution. II.', 'Exclusion of Testimony of Defense Witness', 'The defendant next argues that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of a defense witness regarding co-defendant Barbosa’s out-of-court statements inculpating himself in Raymond’s death. The defendant contends that the hearsay statements were admissible as statements against penal interest pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), and that the trial court’s ruling violated his right to due process under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The State argues that even if the trial court erred by excluding the testimony, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree.', 'On February 14, 2008, the defense witness met with Detectives Richard Nanan and James Soucy of the Manchester Police Department. She told the detectives that she had been writing to Barbosa while he was incarcerated and provided them with letters she alleged were written by Barbosa. The letters allegedly had emboldened words, such as “I hit the dude with the bat,” “he seen me with the bat,” “I did it” and “he knew I did do this and he knows.” The witness also told the detectives that after Barbosa was released from jail, he told her that he hit Raymond with the bat. She further stated that Barbosa told her that he took the bat from the defendant and hit Raymond with it.', 'The State bears the burden of proving that an error was harmless. State v. Fox, 150 N.H. 623, 624 (2004). Error is not harmless unless the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict. Id. An error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of a defendant’s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State’s evidence of guilt. State v. Gordon, 161 N.H. 410, 416-17 (2011). In making this determination, we consider the alternative evidence presented at trial as well as the character of the inadmissible evidence itself. Id. at 417.', 'Assuming, without deciding, that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of the defense witness, we conclude that this error was harmless because the alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt was of an overwhelming nature. For the jury to convict the defendant of second-degree murder, the State was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant “cause[d] such death recklessly under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life.” RSA 630:1-b, I(b).', 'The alternative evidence of second-degree murder included the testimony of Krystal Case that she witnessed a group of people around Raymond who was fighting with two kids. She testified that as she approached the scene, she immediately recognized the defendant standing nearby holding a baseball bat down by his side. She stated that she knew the defendant because he sat in the row next to her in algebra class the previous year. She testified that she saw the defendant run towards Raymond and hit Raymond “in the back of the head and the back” with the baseball bat “[a]bout two or three” times. She stated that Raymond then collapsed.', 'The alternative evidence also included testimony from one witness who saw two men hit Raymond with a bat and then saw Raymond fall to the ground. He testified that at this point everyone “took off” and one of the men ran by him with a bat and dropped the bat in a nearby dumpster. Detective Christopher Sanders testified that, on the day in question, he located a red aluminum baseball bat in a dumpster near the scene of the altercation. Sanders identified this baseball bat at trial. The defendant later identified the same bat as his mother’s and testified that it was the bat he brought to the scene when he confronted Raymond. Further, the evidence included the defendant’s own testimony that he was present at the scene and that he used the bat to make “check swing[s]” at Raymond.', 'Moreover, the excluded evidence that Barbosa struck Raymond with the bat and confessed to doing so would have been cumulative. Cf. State v. Dorval, 144 N.H. 455, 457-58 (1999) (finding any error in trial court’s ruling precluding defendant from cross-examining officer about statements made by uncharged party concerning that party’s knowledge of crime scene was harmless where defendant was able to introduce alternative evidence that uncharged party knew about crime scene from other various sources). Before the defendant offered the testimony at issue here, the jury had heard deposition testimony from Felix Urena that, on the day in question, he saw the defendant pass the bat to Barbosa. Urena further indicated that he witnessed Barbosa hit Raymond twice. Similarly, the jury heard a statement from Carlos Martinez that he witnessed Barbosa hit Raymond with a baseball bat. Both Urena and Martinez stated that Barbosa confessed to them that he hit Raymond with the bat. Further, as mentioned above, another witness saw two men hit Raymond with a bat and one witness identified both the defendant and Barbosa as having a bat. Thus, the jury was made aware that Barbosa struck Raymond with a bat and confessed to doing so.', 'Finally, as to the riot charge, pursuant to RSA 644:1, I, the State had to prove that the defendant', '(a) [s]imultaneously with 2 or more other persons, . . .', 'engage[d] in tumultuous or violent conduct and thereby purposely', 'or recklessly create[d] a substantial risk of causing public alarm;', 'or', '(b) . . . assemble[d] with 2 or more other persons with the', 'purpose of engaging soon thereafter in tumultuous or violent', 'conduct, believing that 2 or more other persons in the assembly', 'have the same purpose; or', '(c) . . . assemble[d] with 2 or more other persons with the', 'purpose of committing an offense against the person or property of', 'another whom he supposes to be guilty of a violation of the law,', 'believing that 2 or more other persons in the assembly have the', 'same purpose. RSA 644:1, I.', 'Here, the alternative evidence of riot was of an overwhelming nature. This evidence included the testimony of a witness who saw the defendant at the scene holding a baseball bat in a group of at least three other people all of whom “started yelling at [Raymond] and surrounding him.” This same witness also saw Barbosa at the scene with a bat. Another witness testified that she saw the defendant at the scene with a baseball bat along with at least three other people who were arguing with Raymond. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court’s error, if any, was harmless. III.', 'Victim’s Statements', 'Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in excluding as hearsay his testimony about statements Raymond made challenging him to fight, calling him a “chicken” and asking him why he was walking away. The defendant argues that Raymond’s statements were not being offered “for the truth of any point,” but rather “to explain its effect on [his] state of mind; to explain, that is, the reasonableness of [his] testimony that he backed away from Raymond while checking his bat.” The State disagrees but argues that even if the trial court erred, any error was harmless.', 'In this case, the State alleged that the defendant caused the death of Raymond by striking him in the head with a baseball bat. It further alleged that the defendant assembled with other individuals for the purpose “of physically attacking” Raymond. The defendant’s theory of defense was that he never struck Raymond with the bat and that he only used the bat to make “check swings” at Raymond in self-defense.', 'At trial, the defendant testified on direct examination as follows:', 'Q: What did you observe about this white person?', 'A: I observed that he had a metal stake.', 'Q: Okay. What was he doing with it?', 'A: Challenging people with it.', 'Q: Okay. Was he challenging you?', 'A: Yes.', 'Q: And what did he say?', 'A: That if I wanted to --', 'MR. CULBERSON [for the State]: Objection, Your', 'Honor. Hearsay. Can we approach, Your Honor?', 'At the subsequent bench conference, defense counsel indicated that the defendant was going to say that Raymond was challenging him to fight. The trial court sustained the State’s objection.', 'Shortly thereafter, the following testimony ensued during the defendant’s direct examination:', 'Q: Okay. And so you couldn’t find him, and you said you', 'decided that you were going to turn around and go home.', 'A: Yes.', 'Q: Okay. Something happened after that?', 'A: Yes.', 'Q: What was that?', 'A: As I was walking to -- back to my house, I crossed the', 'street. And when I crossed the street, I kept walking, and I', 'heard somebody yelling. So I stopped and I turned around,', 'and I seen the person that I was looking for running down', 'the stairs.', 'Q: Okay. And who was that person?', 'A: Stephen Raymond.', 'Q: Okay. And what was he yelling?', 'MR. CULBERSON: Objection. Hearsay.', 'THE COURT: Sustained. Continue, counsel.', 'The defendant later again testified that Raymond “came down, down the stairs and -- yelling and screaming at me. . . . Meaning . . . [Raymond] was saying. He sa[id] something about . . . .” The State then objected on hearsay grounds. The defendant’s counsel indicated that the defendant would testify that Raymond asked him where he was going and if he was a chicken. The trial court sustained the State’s objection.', 'Assuming, arguendo, that the trial court’s rulings were error, we agree with the State that any error was harmless. As discussed above, when the trial court has erroneously excluded evidence, we must reverse unless the State can show beyond a reasonable doubt that such error did not affect the verdict. State v. Gabusi, 149 N.H. 327, 334 (2003). An error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity, or weight, and if the evidence that was improperly excluded is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State’s evidence of guilt. State v. Peters, 162 N.H. ___, ___ (decided May 12, 2011).', 'Here, we have already determined that the alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt was of an overwhelming nature. Against this alternative evidence, the testimony excluded by the trial court was merely cumulative. The defendant testified to the substance of the excluded statements at several other points during his direct and cross-examination. See Gabusi, 149 N.H. at 334 (finding that the testimony excluded was cumulative and, thus, the State met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that it would not have affected the jury’s verdict). Before the first objection, defense counsel asked the defendant whether Raymond was challenging him with a metal stake and the defendant replied, “yes.” Shortly thereafter, the defendant testified that Raymond was “being aggressive” and “waving his stick.” The defendant later testified that Raymond “came down . . . the stairs and -- yelling and screaming at me.” The defendant also testified that he made “check swing[s]” with the bat after Raymond started “walking fast towards” him. Finally, the defendant testified on cross-examination that he told the police that Raymond was calling him a chicken. Admission of more cumulative evidence of Raymond’s statements would not have added to the defendant’s theory that he only used the bat to make “check swings” in self-defense. Cf. Dorval, 144 N.H. at 457. Accordingly, based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the State has met its burden of proving that any error in excluding Raymond’s statements to the defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'The remaining issues raised by the defendant in his notice of appeal, but not briefed, are deemed waived. In re Estate of King, 149 N.H. 226, 230 (2003).', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN, J., concurred; LYNN, J., concurred specially.', 'LYNN, J., concurring specially. I have serious reservations as to whether it is consonant with the judiciary’s role for this court to have devised the detailed form appended to our decision in State v. Benoit, 126 N.H. 6 (1985), and to have announced that the failure to utilize that form or its equivalent creates a presumption that any custodial statement given by a juvenile cannot be admitted into evidence at trial, see id. at 18. In an appropriate case, I would be willing to reconsider Benoit’s holding that Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution requires something more than traditional totality-of- the-circumstances analysis for determining the admissibility of custodial statements made by at least older juveniles, such as the defendant in this case. See Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 725-27 (1979); see also J.D.B. v. North Carolina, ___ U.S. ___, 79 U.S.L.W. 4504 (June 16, 2011) (holding that the age of a child subjected to police questioning, if known to the police or objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, is a factor that must be considered in determining if the child was in custody when the questioning occurred). However, inasmuch as these issues have not been raised in this case, I concur in the result reached by the majority. ']"

Delaney, attorney general (Michael S. Lewis, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'David M. Rothstein, deputy chief appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'DUGGAN, J. The defendant, Robin Knight, appeals his conviction on one count of accomplice to first degree murder, see RSA 626:8, III(a) (2007); RSA 630:1-a, I(a) (2007), and one count of conspiracy to commit murder, see RSA 629:3, I, IV (2007); RSA 630:1, I(b)-(c) (2007). He argues that the Trial Court (Nadeau, J.) erred when it denied his motion to suppress testimony from a jailhouse informant and when it denied his request for a jury instruction on the credibility of informant testimony. We affirm.', 'In September 2003, John Brooks loaded two motorcycles into a trailer in order to move them from a storage facility in Manchester. The next day, Brooks discovered that the trailer had been stolen and suspected that Jack Reid, a handyman he had hired to help him pack, had committed the theft. In 2005, Brooks planned to kill Reid. He recruited Michael Benton, Joseph Vrooman, and the defendant to assist him.', 'Brooks’s plan involved luring Reid to a farmhouse in Deerfield, where Brooks would question Reid about the stolen items and one of the four men would smother Reid to death with Saran Wrap. The job of luring Reid to the farmhouse fell to the defendant. The defendant made a series of phone calls to Reid, and set up a date and a time for Reid to come to the farmhouse. To ensure that Reid would come alone, the defendant told him that he was going through a divorce and needed to save money on labor.', 'In preparation for the confrontation with Reid, the defendant, Brooks, and Vrooman bought zipties, a tarp, gloves, trash bags, and duct tape. The defendant discussed how to kill Reid and suggested using Saran Wrap to smother him. The defendant also discussed plans for disposing of Reid’s body after he was killed, and later drove around on the day of the murder looking for places to dump Reid’s body.', 'On June 27, 2005, Reid arrived alone at the farmhouse in Deerfield. The defendant and Vrooman led him into the farmhouse and down a corridor, toward a closet where Benton was waiting. When Reid reached the end of the corridor, Vrooman pushed Reid into the closet toward Benton. Vrooman then tackled Reid to prevent him from escaping and Benton began beating Reid in the head with a sledgehammer. When Benton stopped the beating and began to walk away, the defendant and Vrooman noticed that Reid was still breathing and instructed Benton to return. Benton went back into the closet and again hit Reid in the head with the sledgehammer.', 'Reid’s body was dragged to the center of the barn and the defendant and Vrooman attempted to contain the bleeding. The defendant handed Saran Wrap to Vrooman, who then attempted to wrap it around Reid’s head. When this failed to contain the blood, the defendant gave Vrooman a plastic tarp to wrap around Reid’s head. Reid was still bleeding, so Brooks struck Reid in the chest with the sledgehammer several times, finally killing him, stating “stop the heart, stop the bleeding.”', 'The four men then wrapped Reid’s body in plastic and duct tape and put his body in the back of Reid’s pickup truck. The men covered Reid’s body with rocks and brush. The defendant and Vrooman drove Reid’s truck with the body in the bed of the truck to Massachusetts, while Brooks and Benton followed in Brooks’s minivan. The defendant navigated a route to avoid tolls so as to avoid detection. Once in Massachusetts, the defendant and Vrooman agreed to leave the truck and the body in a Target parking lot in Saugus.', 'In the days following the killing, the defendant, Brooks, and Vrooman returned to the farmhouse to clean up evidence of the murder. The defendant and Vrooman ripped out and replaced the walls and flooring of the closet where Reid was attacked. The men took the wood that they had ripped out to Bert Seaver’s home to put in his burn pile. The men also briefly considered moving Reid’s body from the Target parking lot, but had disposed of the truck’s keys and did not want to risk “hotwiring” the truck in broad daylight where cameras might be present.', 'Following the murder and clean up, the defendant, Brooks, and Vrooman flew to Las Vegas. On July 5, 2005, Reid’s body was found in the bed of his pickup truck. Phone records, surveillance video from the Target parking lot, and evidence found in the pickup truck led the police to Benton, Brooks, Vrooman and the defendant. The defendant was arrested on November 14, 2006.', 'While the defendant was at the Rockingham County House of Correction, he met Henry Bellemare, another inmate. The defendant had numerous conversations with Bellemare during which he made several incriminating statements regarding Reid’s murder. New Hampshire State Police Detective Robert Estabrook subsequently met with Bellemare at the jail to confirm that he was willing to cooperate with the defendant’s prosecution, and conducted a full interview with him at the state police barracks on June 26, 2007.', 'On May 4, 2009, the day before the first day of jury selection, the defendant filed a motion to suppress Bellemare’s testimony, arguing that Bellemare was an agent of the State when he was speaking with the defendant and thus the State violated the defendant’s right to counsel. A hearing on the motion was held the day before the trial was scheduled to begin. The trial court denied the defendant’s motion as untimely and allowed Bellemare to testify.', 'On appeal the defendant makes two arguments. First, he contends that he had “good cause” for his late filing of the motion to suppress and that the trial court’s remedy of summarily denying the motion was too extreme a sanction. Second, he argues that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in denying his request for a jury instruction on the credibility of informant testimony.', 'With respect to his first issue, the defendant argues that he was not aware of the possible constitutional issues regarding Bellemare until after Bellemare was deposed on May 1, 2009. The State counters that the defendant was provided with details of interviews conducted with Bellemare more than a year before the motion to suppress was filed, as well as letters from attorneys representing both Bellemare and the State, and thus he was provided with more than enough notice of any potential suppression issues.', 'Parties must file motions to suppress “not less than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the scheduled jury selection date or within such other time in advance of trial as the Court may order for good cause shown or may provide for in a pretrial scheduling order.” Super. Ct. R. 98(F). Here, the trial court set a deadline of March 2, 2009, for all dispositive motions and all motions other than motions in limine. The defendant’s motion was not filed until May 4, 2009. “If at any time during the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the court may take such action as it deems just under the circumstances . . . .” Super. Ct. R. 98(J). We review the trial court’s decision to deny a motion to suppress as untimely for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. See State v. Prisby, 131 N.H. 57, 60 (1988).', 'While the trial court may act upon an untimely motion to suppress as a matter of discretion, “defendants are not entitled to assume that a judge will exercise discretion to entertain such a motion at the eleventh hour.” Id. at 58. “Courts have a legitimate interest in the enforcement of scheduling deadlines, both to manage a pending case and to retain the credibility of these deadlines in future cases.” United States v. Trobee, 551 F.3d 835, 838 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 279 (2009); see also State v. Baker, 127 N.H. 801, 804 (1986) (“The way to force an accommodation of sound judicial management with constitutionally mandated procedure is to issue and enforce scheduling rules or orders, with provisions for sanctions against counsel who violate their terms.”).', 'In State v. Cromlish, 146 N.H. 277 (2001), we upheld the trial court’s denial of a defendant’s motion for services other than counsel filed on the eve of trial. There, we noted that', '[a]ny further delay would have required the court to repeat the', 'work necessary to call up and choose another jury as well as', 'adjust its calendar to accommodate the continuance.', 'Furthermore, a continuance on the eve of trial would have required', 'the State and local law enforcement authorities to commit', 'additional resources to repeat trial preparation at a later date.', 'Additionally, the burden on these resources if such last minute', 'continuances were routinely granted would hamper the State’s', 'overall ability to pursue the orderly administration of justice. Id. at 282.', 'In this case, the trial court determined that the defendant received taped interviews between Bellemare and Sergeant Estabrook that included details of the conversations between the defendant and Bellemare. In addition to the taped interviews, the trial court found that the defendant received reports about two other interviews with Bellemare as well as letters from attorneys representing Bellemare and the State “specifically flagging the Sixth Amendment potential issue.” The trial court determined that the defendant had more than enough discovery to file a motion to suppress before the deadline set by the scheduling order.', 'Moreover, the motion was filed more than two months after the deadline set by the scheduling order and was not heard until the day before the trial was to commence. The trial judge is in the best position to determine what is required to ensure the orderly administration of justice. In this case, the judge found that the defendant did not show good cause for the delay, and, because of the impending trial, properly exercised discretion in denying the suppression motion. See Cromlish, 146 N.H. at 282.', 'The defendant next argues that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by refusing his request for a special jury instruction regarding Bellemare’s credibility. The trial court denied the defendant’s request, finding that a specific instruction would constitute an improper comment about the evidence.', '“Whether or not a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of the instruction, is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review the trial court’s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.” State v. Kousounadis, 159 N.H. 413, 422-23 (2009) (quotation omitted). Rather than the specific instruction on Bellemare’s credibility, the court gave the following general credibility charge:', 'In deciding which witnesses to believe, you should obviously use', 'your own personal experiences and your common sense. And let', 'me suggest that you consider a number of other factors: whether', 'the witness appeared to be candid; whether the witness appeared', 'worthy of belief; the appearance, attitude, and demeanor of the', 'witness while testifying; the witness’ age, intelligence, and', 'experience; the accuracy of the witness’ memory; whether the', 'witness had an interest in the outcome of the case; whether the', 'witness had any reason for not telling the truth; whether what the', 'witness said seemed reasonable or probable; whether what the', 'witness said seemed unreasonable or inconsistent with other', 'evidence in the case or with prior statements made by the witness;', 'and whether the witness had any friendship or animosity toward', 'other people involved in the case.', 'In addition to this general credibility instruction, the court also gave an instruction on testimony of accomplices cooperating with the State. The court charged the jury to consider', 'whether the testimony of these witnesses has been affected by the', 'immunity they have been granted or by the agreements they have', 'struck with the State, by the sentence, if any, they expect to', 'receive, by their own self-interest in the outcome of this case, or by', 'any prejudice such witness may have either for or against the State', 'or the Defendant.', 'The defendant would have us set forth a categorical rule requiring a cautionary instruction to be given whenever informants testify. “Categorical imperatives established by appellate judges in advance and imposed on trial judges are entirely inappropriate in [this situation].” United States v. Cook, 102 F.3d 249, 255 (7th Cir. 1996) (Ripple, J., concurring). The trial judge is in the best position to make the prudential judgment as to whether a particular instruction should be given. We have long recognized that the decision to give a particular instruction concerning the testimony of witnesses and the wording of that instruction are within the sound discretion of the trial court.', 'In this case, defense counsel had an opportunity to cross-examine Bellemare and highlight any potential motives or biases that he may have had. The trial judge chose to give a general credibility instruction, providing a number of factors for jurors to consider when assessing the weight of each witness’s testimony. In addition, the court gave an instruction highlighting the need for jurors to scrutinize those witnesses cooperating with the State and their possible ulterior motives. We cannot say that the choice to give the general credibility instruction, which highlighted certain specific factors for jurors to consider, rather than the defendant’s requested informant instruction, was “beyond the range of options from which one would expect a trial judge to select in such a situation.” Id. at 256 (Ripple, J., concurring).', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

MELLO', 'Argued: April 13, 2011', 'Opinion Issued: May 26, 2011', 'Michael A. Delaney, attorney general (Thomas E. Bocian, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Wilson, Bush, Durkin & Keefe, P.C., of Nashua (Charles J. Keefe on the brief and orally), for the defendant.', 'DUGGAN, J. The defendant, James W. Mello, appeals his conviction following a bench trial on four counts of delivery of child pornography. See RSA 649-A:3, I(a), II(a) (2007) (amended 2008). He argues that the Superior Court (Arnold, J.) erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence derived from a search warrant issued by the Keene District Court, which authorized a search for information held by an out-of-state corporation. We affirm.', 'The record supports the following facts. As an aid to the investigation of crimes related to the sexual exploitation of children, Detective James McLaughlin of the Keene Police Department placed a profile on an Internet social networking site. The profile indicated that he was a fourteen-year-old boy and included a photograph of a boy who was approximately that age. In October 2008, the defendant added McLaughlin’s fictitious profile to his friend list on the social networking site. The defendant’s profile on the site included several photographs of nude male children, some of which were pornographic in nature. McLaughlin and the defendant subsequently engaged in several e- mail and real-time chat exchanges between October 12 and October 15. Many of these exchanges were sexually explicit in nature and the defendant sent numerous pornographic images depicting male children to McLaughlin by e- mail and real-time chat.', 'Using the defendant’s e-mail address, “wildbill0911,” McLaughlin determined the defendant’s corresponding Internet Protocol (IP) address. McLaughlin’s check of the IP address also identified the subscriber’s location as Nashua and his Internet service provider as Comcast, a New Jersey based corporation. On October 20, 2008, McLaughlin obtained a search warrant authorizing a search for subscriber information associated with the defendant’s IP address. The warrant stated that Comcast was in possession of that information. The Keene District Court issued the warrant and McLaughlin faxed it to Comcast. Comcast responded by faxed letter and provided the subscriber’s name, address, telephone number, type of service, account number, account status, IP assignment, e-mail user IDs, and method of payment.', 'Based upon this information, McLaughlin applied for and received an additional warrant to search the defendant’s home for certain computer-related equipment. McLaughlin and the Nashua Police Department executed the warrant and seized evidence that led to the indictment of the defendant on four counts of delivery of child pornography.', 'The defendant subsequently filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the initial search warrant. He contended that the district court exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction by issuing a warrant for evidence held by an out-of-state corporation. The trial court denied the motion because the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information obtained from Comcast.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the warrant to obtain his subscriber information was issued in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution. We first address the defendant’s claim under our State Constitution and cite federal cases for guidance only. State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). We review the superior court’s order on a motion to suppress de novo, except as to any controlling facts determined by the superior court in the first instance. State v. Goss, 150 N.H. 46, 47 (2003).', 'The defendant contends that the district court did not have the authority to issue a search warrant to a corporation outside of New Hampshire. At oral argument, the State conceded that the search warrant was defective. We agree that the district court did not have jurisdiction to issue a warrant to an out-of- state corporation. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to outline some of the proper procedures for obtaining records and evidence located outside of New Hampshire.', 'For example, the legislature has provided two mechanisms for obtaining such evidence, neither of which was followed in this case. See RSA 7:6-b (2003); RSA ch. 613 (2001). The first method pertains only to records held by a “communications common carrier,” see RSA 7:6-b, defined as “a person engaged in providing communications services to the general public through transmission of any form of information between subscribers by means of wire, cable, radio or electromagnetic transmission, optical or fiber-optic transmission, or other means which transfers information without physical transfer of medium.” RSA 570-A:1, IX (2001). Upon written demand of the attorney general, or his designee, that he “has reasonable grounds for belief that the service furnished to a person or to a location by such communications common carrier has been, is being, or may be used for an unlawful purpose,” the carrier must provide certain identifying information, including the name and address of the subscriber. RSA 7:6-b, I, III.', 'Alternatively, RSA chapter 613 provides a uniform method, which has been adopted by all fifty states and the District of Columbia, for requesting the appearance of an out-of-state witness in New Hampshire. This uniform statute provides that a New Hampshire court may summons a material out-of-state witness in any grand jury investigation or criminal prosecution that has commenced or is about to commence by issuing a certificate under the seal of the court requesting the presence of that witness. RSA 613:3, I. That certificate must then be presented to a court in the county in which the witness is found. Id. Thus, in this case, the State could have requested a New Hampshire court to summons Comcast’s keeper of records to New Hampshire. We also note that these two examples do not foreclose the possibility that there may be other permissible means for obtaining evidence from an out-of-state corporation.', 'Nonetheless, the defective warrant infringed upon the defendant’s constitutional rights only if the effort to obtain evidence constituted a search in the constitutional sense. See State v. Valenzuela, 130 N.H. 175, 181-82 (1987). The defendant asserts that a search took place because he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the subscriber information that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The State argues that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because he voluntarily conveyed the information to Comcast.', '“Our State Constitution protects all people, their papers, their possessions and their homes from unreasonable searches and seizures.” Goss, 150 N.H. at 48 (quotation omitted). We have recognized that an expectation of privacy plays a role in the protection afforded under Part I, Article 19. State v. Robinson, 158 N.H. 792, 796 (2009). In Goss, we adopted a two-part analysis for determining whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy: “first, that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.” Goss, 150 N.H. at 49 (quotations omitted).', 'The State does not dispute that the defendant had a subjective expectation of privacy in his subscriber information. Accordingly, we need only decide whether the defendant’s subjective expectation of privacy was one that society would be prepared to recognize as reasonable.', 'We have previously held that a defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in business records containing information voluntarily provided to a public utility. State v. Gubitosi, 152 N.H. 673, 677-79 (2005); Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 183; see also Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-45 (1979). In Valenzuela, we relied upon a series of United States Supreme Court “agent- informer” cases and determined that the government’s use of a pen register to record outgoing telephone numbers dialed by the defendant was not a search within the meaning of Article 19. Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 188-89. These “agent-informer” cases have consistently held that information revealed by a defendant to a government informant or agent is admissible even if the informant or agent conceals his true identity. Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302 (1966); Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206, 210-11 (1966); United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 752 (1971). We explained in Valenzuela that in making a record of a decoded signal sent from the defendant’s phone to the telephone company, “the registers did no more than record voluntary communications from the defendant to the telephone company.” Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 183. We also specifically distinguished these communications to the company from the contents of communications transmitted over the company’s lines, addressed to recipients of completed calls. Id.', 'We confronted a similar issue more recently in Gubitosi, where we specifically declined the defendant’s invitation to overrule Valenzuela. Gubitosi, 152 N.H. at 678. There, we determined that just as a defendant has no protected privacy interest in a record of his outgoing phone calls, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in a record of a defendant’s cell phone calls “recorded for billing purposes and retained by [the telephone company] in the ordinary course of its business.” Id. at 677-78.', 'Likewise, we see no meaningful distinction between obtaining telephone numbers recorded in the ordinary course of business by a telephone company and the procurement of a customer’s basic subscriber information from an Internet service provider. As in Valenzuela and Gubitosi, the defendant voluntarily provided the information to Comcast, which recorded it in the ordinary course of business for billing purposes and used it to provide the defendant with Internet service. Having voluntarily provided this information in order to use Comcast’s service, the defendant cannot now claim a privacy interest in it. See Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 188 (explaining that once a defendant voluntarily discloses information to another he cannot claim a degree of privacy protection against the government because it would result in “a kind of evidentiary copyright”). Accordingly, we join the overwhelming majority of federal and state courts that have addressed this issue and conclude that a defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in subscriber information voluntarily provided to an Internet service provider. See, e.g., United States v. Perrine, 518 F.3d 1196, 1204 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 440 (2010); Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 336 (6th Cir. 2001); United States v. D’Andrea, 497 F. Supp. 2d 117, 120 (D. Mass. 2007); State v. Delp, 178 P.3d 259, 264-65 (Or. Ct. App. 2008); Hause v. Com., 83 S.W.3d 1, 12 (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).', 'Our conclusion is bolstered by Comcast’s customer privacy policy, which specifically reserves the right to disclose subscriber information to “comply with law.” The defendant contends that this exception to the privacy policy is inapplicable because Comcast responded to a defective warrant. We are unpersuaded by this distinction because Comcast undoubtedly believed that it was disclosing the defendant’s information in order to “comply with law.”', 'Nonetheless, the defendant asks us to recognize a privacy interest in his subscriber information based upon our decision in Goss that an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in sealed garbage bags left in front of a residence for collection. Goss, 150 N.H. at 49-50. He contends that Goss stands for the proposition “that by exposing information to a third party, when one does not expect it to be revealed to anyone else in the ordinary course, that one does not lose an expectation of privacy in that information.”', 'The defendant reads Goss too broadly. While the defendant correctly points out that we construed our State Constitution to provide greater protection than the Federal Constitution, we explicitly relied upon the fact that people do not voluntarily expose the contents of their sealed trash bags to the public when they leave those bags out for regular collection. Goss, 150 N.H. at 49. Additionally, in Gubitosi, we rejected the defendant’s similar reliance upon Goss to contend that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephone billing records because they “only contain information that he voluntarily conveyed to [the phone company] in order to make use of its telephone service.” Gubitosi, 152 N.H. at 679. Likewise, as we have already determined, the defendant here voluntarily provided his subscriber information to Comcast, and in doing so, lost any reasonable expectation of privacy in that information. Accordingly, Goss is distinguishable from the facts of this case.', 'The defendant also points us to the New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Reid, 945 A.2d 26 (N.J. 2008), which, contrary to the majority of jurisdictions, recognized a reasonable expectation of privacy in Internet subscriber information. Reid, 945 A.2d at 33-34. The court in Reid began its analysis by recognizing that federal courts, relying upon “settled federal law that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information exposed to third parties, like a telephone company or bank,” have found no expectation of privacy in Internet subscriber information. Id. at 31. Nonetheless, the court reached a different conclusion based upon its own case law, which recognizes a reasonable expectation of privacy in telephone billing and bank records. Id. at 32.', 'Despite our previous reliance upon “settled federal law” recognizing no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily exposed to third parties, the defendant urges us to adopt the reasoning of Reid. He contends that our State Constitution, like New Jersey’s State Constitution, provides greater privacy protection than the Federal Constitution. While Part I, Article 19 does offer greater protection than the Fourth Amendment in some circumstances, see Goss, 150 N.H. at 49; State v. Sterndale, 139 N.H. 445, 449 (1995) (refusing to adopt an automobile exception to the warrant requirement), our law regarding information voluntarily exposed to third parties is in line with the protection afforded under the Fourth Amendment and diverges significantly from New Jersey law, see Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 182-84 (relying upon the “well-settled” and “inescapable” United States Supreme Court precedent that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily exposed to third parties); Gubitosi, 152 N.H. at 677 (noting that we relied upon Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), in Valenzuela to determine that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in phone numbers dialed to make outgoing calls). Accordingly, we do not find Reid persuasive and decline to follow it.', 'We recognize how intertwined and essential computers and the Internet have become to everyday, modern life. See Reid, 945 A.2d at 33. Citizens routinely access the Internet for a wide range of daily activities, such as gathering information, communicating, shopping, banking, and more. We are also cognizant that many users conduct some of their most private affairs over the Internet because of the anonymity that it offers. Nonetheless, as we similarly recognized in Valenzuela more than twenty years ago, while individuals may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their communications, i.e., the content of e-mails and the specific content viewed over the Internet, they have no such privacy interest in information voluntarily disclosed to an Internet service provider in order to gain access to the Internet. See Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 183; cf. United States v. Forrester, 512 F.3d 500, 510 (9th Cir. 2008) (“When the government obtains the to/from addresses of a person’s e-mails or the IP addresses of websites visited, it does not find out the contents of the messages or know the particular pages on the websites the person viewed. At best, the government may make educated guesses . . . .”); United States v.

Following a jury trial in Superior Court (Smukler, J.), the defendant, Michael Soto, appeals his conviction for being an accomplice to first-degree murder. See RSA 626:8, 630:1-a, I(a) (2007). We affirm.', 'I', 'The defendant’s conviction arises out of the fatal shooting of Aaron Kar in Manchester on the evening of January 2, 2007. On the previous day, a man named Bill threatened Roney White’s young cousins with a knife at a 7-Eleven store close to Roney’s home. When Roney learned of the incident from his cousins, he directed them to identify the man with the knife. Finding Bill standing outside the store, Roney punched him in the face in retaliation and fled the scene. Later that night, apparently in response to Roney’s actions, Kar and his friends drove past a small group of people standing on the street, which included Roney, his brother Roscoe White, and their friend Anthony Clagon, and unsuccessfully attempted to hit one of them with a stick from the moving vehicle. No further encounter between the two groups occurred that night.', 'The next day, at around 2:30 p.m., Bill and another person attacked Roney with a baseball bat as he was walking alone on Nashua Street. Badly injured, Roney stumbled home to his mother and two brothers, Roscoe and Raymond Alleyene. Roney’s mother took him to the hospital. Shortly thereafter, Alleyene, Clagon, and Roscoe met at Roscoe’s house and discussed the possibility of an armed fight in retaliation for the attack on Roney. After Roscoe failed to get his own gun to work, he called some friends in Nashua, asking them to bring a gun.', 'That evening, the defendant, his brother Sergio, Andrew Gonzalez, and Clagon’s cousin Kim and her children drove from Nashua to Manchester in a red Chevrolet Blazer. The men met Clagon, Alleyene, and Roscoe in the room Roscoe shared with Roney, smoked marijuana, and settled on a plan to find Roney’s attackers and confront them. After Roscoe confirmed that the defendant had brought a gun, the six men set out in the Blazer to find Roney’s attackers. A short time later, they found a group of people whom they suspected had been involved in Roney’s attack gathered near a dumpster. After driving past the group once or twice, they parked the Blazer around the corner and discussed who would do the shooting. They settled on Roscoe as the shooter based on his blood relationship with Roney. The defendant then wiped the gun with his shirt, racked the slide to cock it, and handed it to Roscoe. Roscoe left with a mask on, shot Kar in the leg and abdomen, returned to the Blazer, and the men drove away. Kar later died from his wounds.', 'The jury convicted the defendant of first-degree murder based on his role as an accomplice in Kar’s death. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred: (1) in not giving the jury a provocation manslaughter instruction; (2) in not giving a reckless manslaughter instruction; and (3) in permitting the introduction of an audio recording of Roscoe White discussing the crime with an informant.', 'II', 'The defendant first argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury to consider whether the defendant acted under an extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation, see RSA 630:2, I(a), thereby reducing his criminal liability from murder to manslaughter. He argues that “there was overwhelming evidence to support a jury determination that Soto had been adequately provoked within the meaning of [the provocation provision of the manslaughter statute].” We disagree.', 'The defendant was entitled to the requested jury instruction only if there was some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense. State v. Balliro, 158 N.H. 1, 5 (2008) (quotation and brackets omitted). “Some evidence” requires more than a minutia or scintilla of evidence. Id. “Where . . . there is simply no evidentiary basis to support the theory of the requested jury instruction, the party is not entitled to such an instruction, and the trial court may properly deny the party’s request.” Id. (quotation omitted). We will search the record for evidence supporting the defendant’s requested jury instruction, and we will uphold the denial of a requested jury instruction absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. Id.', '“A person is guilty of manslaughter when he causes the death of another . . . [u]nder the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation but which would otherwise constitute murder.” RSA 630:2, I(a) (2007). Under the common-law rule, to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter, the provocation must be so severe or extreme as to provoke a reasonable person to kill another person out of passion.1 State v. Smith, 123 N.H. 46, 48 (1983). Even if a reasonable person would have committed the act, still the defendant must have been actually provoked. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 15.2(c), at 506 (2d ed. 2003). And even a defendant so provoked will not be entitled to a manslaughter instruction where the time elapsing between the provocation and the killing is such that a reasonable person would have cooled. Id. § 15.2(d), at 507. “[I]f, from any circumstances whatever, it appears that the party reflected, deliberated, or 1', 'Most modern formulations of the common-law “heat of passion” doctrine measure both the adequacy of the provocation and the severity of the response by a “reasonable person” standard. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §15.2(b)(10), at 504 (2d ed. 2003). Unlike in the tort context, however, the reasonable person standard in the provocation context is not a standard of acceptable, non-blameworthy conduct; rather it is a fiction that stands for a centuries-old recognition that, in certain extreme circumstances, even an average person of ordinary disposition may suffer a temporary loss of reason and control. See id. at 495 (“[T]he reasonable man, however greatly provoked he may be, does not kill.”). Provocation manslaughter is, therefore, a “concession to human frailty,” reflected in the fact that a person killing under an extreme mental or emotional disturbance in response to extreme provocation has committed a serious crime – manslaughter – but not as serious a crime as first or second-degree murder. cooled any period of time before the fatal stroke was given, or if in legal presumption there was time or opportunity for cooling, the killing will amount to murder, being attributable to malice and revenge, and not to mental disturbance.” 40 Am. Jur. 2d Homicide § 60, at 648 (2008).', 'Before applying these principles to the facts, we note that our case law has approached provocation manslaughter in two arguably inconsistent ways: as a lesser-included offense of murder, see State v. Little, 123 N.H. 433, 435 (1983), and as a “defense” to murder, see State v. O’Leary, 153 N.H. 710, 713- 14 (2006); State v. Taylor, 141 N.H. 89, 94-96 (1996). In contrast to our 1983 decision in Little, which referred to provocation manslaughter as a lesser- included offense of murder, see Little, 123 N.H. at 435-36, in Taylor we referred to provocation manslaughter as a defense to murder. See Taylor, 141 N.H. at 96. We approved of the jury instructions in Taylor because the trial court instructed the jury to consider provocation manslaughter alongside both first and second-degree murder, effectively treating provocation as a defense to both charges rather than as a lesser-included offense meriting the jury’s attention only after the jury had fully deliberated on both the first-degree and second- degree murder charges. See id. Consistent with this holding, in O’Leary, we concluded that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury to consider the “lesser-included offense” of provocation manslaughter only after the jury had first acquitted the defendant of first and second-degree murder; despite this error, we affirmed the defendant’s conviction because we found the error harmless. See O’Leary, 153 N.H. at 713-17.', 'We have never treated provocation manslaughter under RSA 630:2, I(a) as a true “defense” under the Criminal Code triggering the notice requirements of Superior Court Rules 98(B) and 101, and we decline to do so today. Rather, provocation is best understood as a “partial defense” because, unlike traditional defenses that serve to discharge a defendant’s liability for conduct that otherwise constitutes a crime, provocation manslaughter comprises a set of mitigating circumstances that can negate the mens rea required for intentional murder and, even where they do not have this negation effect, can warrant a jury in finding the defendant guilty of a separate, less culpable offense than murder under the Code. See Berman & Farrell, Provocation Manslaughter as Partial Justification and Partial Excuse, 52 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1027, 1045 (2011) (recognizing this widely-accepted approach). Unlike the defenses of insanity or self-defense, provocation under RSA 630:2, I(a) only reduces, but does not eliminate, the punishment for murder,2 based on what the law conceives as a lesser degree of culpability for acts done under the 2 In our statutes, a person convicted of first-degree murder must be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. RSA 630:1-a, III (2007). By contrast, a person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to no more than thirty years imprisonment. RSA 630:2, II (2007). influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance in response to extreme provocation.', 'Although provocation is only a partial rather than a full defense, because it can operate both to reduce the mens rea required for murder and to provide a basis for the jury’s invocation of the community’s sense of compassion, we conclude that provocation, when properly raised, should be treated similarly to self-defense. Accordingly, to guide trial courts in the future, we advise that, in a murder prosecution, the State must prove the absence of provocation beyond a reasonable doubt when the defendant presents some evidence to support a rational finding that he caused the death at issue under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation. See Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 704 (1975). For example, in a first-degree murder prosecution under RSA 630:1-a, I(a), where a defendant presents evidence to support a rational finding of provocation manslaughter, juries should be instructed that to find the defendant guilty of first-degree murder the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the defendant caused the death of the victim; (2) that he acted “purposely” under the special definition of that term in RSA 630:1-a, II;3 and (3) that he did not act under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation. The jury should also be given an acquittal first instruction indicating that, if the jury finds the defendant not guilty of first-degree murder pursuant to the foregoing instructions, it should next consider whether the State has proved, again beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements of second- degree murder under RSA 630:1-b, I(a): (1) that the defendant caused the death of the victim; (2) that he acted knowingly; and (3) that he did not act under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation. Once again, the jury should be given the acquittal first instruction and told that if it finds the defendant not guilty of second-degree murder, it should then go on to consider whether he is guilty of provocation manslaughter, the elements of this offense being: (1) that the defendant caused the death of the victim; and (2) that the defendant acted either purposely or knowingly. The jury should also be instructed that, if it reaches the crime of provocation manslaughter in its deliberations, the defendant may be found guilty of this crime if the State proves the foregoing two elements beyond a reasonable doubt even if the jury concludes that the defendant acted 3 The definition of “purposely” found in the first-degree murder statute has two components: (1) that the defendant’s conscious object was to cause the death of another; and (2) that the defendant’s acts in furtherance of this object were deliberate and premeditated. See RSA 630:1-a, II (2007). This specific definition applicable to the first-degree murder offense proscribed by RSA 630:1-a, I(a) is different from the general definition of “purposely” which applies to other crimes in the Criminal Code. See RSA 626:2, II(a) (2007). under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation.4', 'Turning now to the circumstances of the instant case, we conclude that the undisputed facts culminating in Kar’s death reveal no evidence upon which a provocation instruction was warranted. At least two hours passed between the moment the defendant learned by telephone that Roney had been attacked and the moment the defendant and his friends found and killed Kar. In that time, the defendant located a loaded gun, drove with his friends from Nashua to Manchester, met with Roscoe and several others at Roscoe’s home, smoked marijuana, and discussed how to avenge the attack on Roney. The drive to Manchester took about one-half hour and the discussion in Roney’s home took at least an additional half-hour. Then, with the defendant’s brother driving, they set out to find Roney’s assailants on the street. When they found the men they were looking for, they drove past once or twice, parked around the corner, and discussed for about seven or eight minutes who would do the shooting. After the group settled on Roscoe as the shooter, the defendant pulled out a gun, wiped it off, cocked it, and gave it to Roscoe, telling him the gun was “smooth.”', 'This sequence is not consistent with a sudden emotional disturbance from which the defendant had no time to regain control of his passions. Even assuming that Kar was the person with Bill during the attack on Roney the day before, and that such attack both actually and reasonably provoked the defendant, a reasonable person would not remain in that extreme emotional state after driving to a different city, meeting with several friends to discuss how to retaliate, taking the time to smoke marijuana, and again driving to search for one’s provokers. The law is careful to distinguish a sudden rush of passion following extreme provocation, on the one hand, from a desire for revenge, on the other. See State v. Henson, 197 P.3d 456, 464 (Kan. 2008). A provocation manslaughter instruction is simply not appropriate where, as here, the defendant has killed after a period of reflection and deliberation during which a reasonable person’s passions would have cooled. See LaFave, supra § 15.2(d), at 507; see also State v. Ramirez, 569 P.2d 201, 213 (Ariz. 1977) (four and a half hours sufficient to show cool state of mind); Com. v. Colon, 866 N.E.2d 412, 425 (Mass. 2007) (“[W]here the alleged provocation is followed by at least a few minutes during which the defendant and the victim are 4 The instruction on the elements of provocation manslaughter specified in the text also takes account of the fact that this offense can be charged as a stand-alone crime. See, e.g., State v. Darcy, 121 N.H. 220, 221 (1981). That is, in circumstances where the prosecution is prepared to accept the fact that the defendant meets the criteria for adequate provocation, it can eliminate the need to disprove this circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt by charging the defendant only with violating RSA 630:2, I(a). Cf. Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 199 n.3 (1977) (quoting New York statute providing that in prosecution for manslaughter, provocation need not be proved). separated, and then the defendant seeks out the victim, a charge of voluntary manslaughter based on provocation is not warranted.” (emphasis added)); Com. v. Keohane, 829 N.E.2d 1125, 1130 (Mass. 2005) (“[E]ven where sufficient provocation exists, if a defendant leaves the scene of the provocation . . . and then returns to attack the victim, the defendant is considered to have had adequate opportunity for his anger to subside.”); People v. Pouncey, 471 N.W.2d 346, 351 (Mich. 1991) (going to safe harbor and retrieving gun sufficient cooling time).', 'Equally implausible is the defendant’s contention that he had not actually cooled off. “[A defendant] cannot have his homicide reduced to voluntary manslaughter if . . . he has actually cooled off by the time he commits his deadly act.” LaFave, supra § 15.2(e), at 509. Anger alone is not sufficient to warrant a provocation instruction; the law requires an extreme emotional response to a sufficiently provoking event. Washington v. State, 808 N.E.2d 617, 626 (Ind. 2004). Here, the defendant’s actions leading up to the killing reveal a calm and calculating state of mind, guided not by a sudden, uncontrollable passion but by a desire to avenge the beating of his friend. See LaFave, supra § 15.2(a), at 494 (“A passion for revenge, of course, will not do.” (quotation omitted)). Even after learning of the attack on Roney, driving from Nashua to Manchester with a gun, meeting his friends to plot a violent response, and locating Roney’s assailants, the defendant had the presence of mind to wipe the gun down with his shirt, rack the slide, and advise Roscoe that the gun was “smooth.” For these reasons, the trial judge acted well within his discretion in refusing to instruct the jury as to provocation manslaughter.', 'III', 'The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on reckless manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of reckless second-degree murder. In addition to the indictment charging the defendant with first-degree murder, he also was charged in a separate indictment with second-degree murder for allegedly recklessly causing the death of Kar under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. See RSA 630:1-b, I(b) (2007).', 'In general, a defendant charged with one offense is entitled to have the jury consider any lesser-included offenses. State v. Cameron, 121 N.H. 348, 350 (1981). This rule safeguards criminal defendants’ due process rights by providing juries an alternative to convicting on only the crime the prosecution opted to charge and minimizing the risk that juries will make “all or nothing” decisions. See Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 637-38 (1980). Whether the defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction involves a two-part inquiry: first, the lesser offense must be embraced within the definition of the greater offense; and second, the evidence adduced at trial must provide a rational basis for a guilty finding on the lesser offense. See State v. Thomas, 154 N.H. 189, 192 (2006).', 'The State contends that any error in failing to instruct the jury on reckless manslaughter was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. An error is harmless only if it is determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the verdict was not affected by the error. State v. Hernandez, 159 N.H. 394, 402 (2009). The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. Id.', 'The State concedes, as it must, that reckless manslaughter is a lesser- included offense of murder. See RSA 630:2, I(b) (2007); State v. Howland, 119 N.H. 413, 416 (1979). We also assume without deciding that the evidence at trial would have supported a rational conclusion that the defendant acted merely recklessly (rather than recklessly with extreme indifference to the value of human life) in giving Roscoe the gun used to kill the victim. In this case, however, any error in refusing to instruct the jury on reckless manslaughter was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant was charged with two offenses: first-degree murder, requiring that the defendant caused Kar’s death purposely, see RSA 630:1-a, I(a) (2007); and reckless second-degree murder, requiring that the defendant caused Kar’s death recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, see RSA 630:1-b, I(b) (2007). The trial judge instructed the jury as to both offenses, correctly identifying their elements for the jury’s consideration. Further, the judge issued an “acquittal first” instruction, telling the jury they must first acquit the defendant of first-degree murder before considering the lesser offense of second-degree murder. Because the jury in this case convicted the defendant of purposeful first-degree murder even though they had the option of convicting the defendant of the less serious offense of reckless second-degree murder under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, it follows that the jury would not have considered the still less serious offense of reckless manslaughter (not involving extreme indifference to life) even if it had received such an instruction. We therefore conclude that any error in failing to give such an instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'IV', 'Finally, the defendant objects to the admission of a jailhouse recording of a conversation between Roscoe (who was at the time incarcerated on an unrelated matter) and a confidential informant. In that recording, Roscoe confessed to having shot the victim and shared certain details leading up to and following the shooting. He also told the informant that the gun was already “cocked back” and referred in the same sentence to “Mike,” which prompted the informant to ask Roscoe if he meant that “Mikey” – the defendant – had cocked the gun for him. Roscoe did not intelligibly answer the informant’s question. The defendant argues that this recording contained inadmissible hearsay and otherwise violated his state and federal confrontation rights. The State contends that the court properly admitted the recording as a statement against penal interest, and that any error was harmless.', 'Assuming without deciding that the admission of the exchange constituted error, we agree with the State that any such error was harmless. For an error to be harmless, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict. Hernandez, 159 N.H. at 402. “An error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity, or weight, and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State’s evidence of guilt.” State v. Thompson, 149 N.H. 565, 567 (2003) (quotation omitted). Here, the recorded conversation tended only to prove (1) Roscoe’s role as the shooter and his recollections of certain details of the shooting, and (2) the defendant’s role in cocking the murder weapon for Roscoe. The defendant does not dispute the former point. As to the latter, the defendant’s argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, Andrew Gonzalez testified at trial that the defendant cocked the gun before handing it to Roscoe, making the disputed portion of the recording cumulative as to that fact. Second, whether or not the defendant cocked the gun is, on the facts here, wholly unnecessary to a finding of accomplice liability. Even if that fact lent some probative weight to the State’s contention that the defendant shared Roscoe’s intent to kill, the other evidence against the defendant overwhelmingly implicated him in the scheme to kill Kar. For example, Clagon testified that, sometime after Roscoe placed a telephone call to Nashua asking the person on the other end of the line to “bring that thing,” the defendant and his brother arrived at Roscoe’s home in Manchester. Roscoe asked the defendant, in person, if he had brought “the thing” and the defendant confirmed that he had. Clagon and Gonzalez both testified that, after the defendant and his friends located their targets, they parked around the corner to discuss who would do the shooting; Gonzalez testified that the defendant volunteered to do it. And, most importantly, both Clagon and Gonzalez testified that the defendant handed the gun to Roscoe, who then walked around the corner and shot Kar. Given this evidence, even absent the disputed portion of the recorded conversation between Roscoe and the confidential informant, there remained overwhelming evidence to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN, HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

As Hernandez approached her car, she saw the group. One of the State’s witnesses testified that Hernandez started yelling at them, saying things like “f--- you.” Garger yelled back, and there was testimony at trial that Hernandez then slapped Garger in the face. At some point, the rest of the group also began yelling and swearing at Hernandez and ridiculing her for a New York Yankees decal she had on her car.', 'After this exchange, Hernandez got into her car, started it and backed out of the parking space. One witness testified that as Hernandez was driving away, the group continued to yell at her and Beaudoin banged on her car with his hand. Hernandez left the parking lot, drove across Elm Street and entered a narrow dirt parking lot. As the group left the City Hall parking lot and began walking home, Hernandez turned her car around and drove directly towards the group. At trial, one witness testified that Hernandez then revved her engine and accelerated towards the group. Hughes attempted to jump out of the way, but the car hit her knee, causing a minor injury. The car also struck Beaudoin and then crashed into a parking meter. Beaudoin was severely injured, and died later that morning at 10:30.', 'After the crash, Hernandez immediately called 911 and then got out and kneeled by the front of her car. The police arrived at the scene within minutes. Hernandez was visibly distraught, crying and apologizing. She was also bleeding from a laceration to her nose caused by her face striking the steering wheel. She was taken to the hospital for treatment. At approximately 6:30 a.m., Hernandez was taken from the hospital to the police station where she was booked and placed in a holding cell.', 'At around 11:00 a.m., Detectives Molinari and Testaverde escorted Hernandez from the holding cell to a room for an interview. The detectives explained that the interview would be audio and video recorded. Hernandez was allowed to bring a blanket with her to the interview and the detectives gave her breakfast bars, juice boxes and cigarettes. The interview lasted approximately two hours.', 'At the beginning of the interview, Hernandez informed the detectives that she could read and understand English; that she had obtained her GED; that on the day of the incident she had smoked marijuana; and that she had drunk four beers that night. Testaverde then explained her Miranda rights. As he was explaining these rights, Hernandez asked whether the detectives would “go against her.” In response, Testaverde told Hernandez, “Last night you were charged um, with a crime . . . . Anything you say, OK, can be used against you in court . . . we write all our reports up, and, and we just present it . . . and say here’s what happened.” Testaverde then finished reviewing her Miranda rights and Hernandez signed a waiver of her rights.', 'Shortly thereafter, Hernandez inquired whether Beaudoin “[was] OK.” By this point, Beaudoin had already been pronounced dead, but Testaverde replied, “He’s getting some treatment . . . . We hope that he’s gonna be OK.” At trial, Testaverde testified that although he did downplay the extent of Beaudoin’s injuries, he had not been aware that the victim was dead. Molinari testified that during interviews, he generally employs minimization techniques. He also stated that this interview was not at all confrontational, and that it was actually “friendly.”', 'During the remainder of the interview, Hernandez described the altercation that occurred in the parking lot. She told the detectives that after she got into her car and drove to the dirt parking lot, she was scared. Throughout the interview, Hernandez claimed that she turned her car around only because she wanted to go home, that the incident was an accident, and that she didn’t want to hit anyone. However, when Detective Testaverde said, “You turn around, you’re gonna say . . . you think you’re a good Red Sox fan . . . I’m a better Yankee’s fan. And I’m going to say screw you. Is that what we’re talking about here?” Hernandez responded, “Ya.”', 'About fifty-six minutes into the interview, the following exchange occurred:', 'DETECTIVE TESTAVERDE: [H]ow close did you want to come to', '[Beaudoin]?', 'HERNANDEZ: Not… pff…', 'DETECTIVE TESTAVERDE: Not close?', 'HERNANDEZ: No. No.', 'DETECTIVE TESTAVERDE: Between you and me, and [Detective', 'Molinari], OK, the three of us in this room, OK, inside, inside your', 'heart . . . did you want to run that [sic] over?', 'HERNANDEZ: No. No. God no. Hernandez then continued to explain that the incident was an accident and that she did not want to hit anyone. However, a few minutes later, Hernandez told Testaverde that witnesses would think she wanted to run Beaudoin over. Testaverde then asked, “Ivonne, for that split second, wasn’t that true?” and she replied, “Ya.” A few minutes after that, Testaverde inquired how she felt when she was driving toward the group. He asked, “[W]hen you get that sight on these people and you gun it, and you start going, you get that feeling, F-U. Am I wrong?” Hernandez responded, “No you’re not.”', 'Before trial, the defendant moved to have these inculpatory statements suppressed. The trial judge denied the motion.', 'I', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the statements she made during the police interrogation were involuntary and, therefore, their admission violated her right to due process under the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. See U.S. CONST., amend. XIV; N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. We first review the defendant’s arguments under the State Constitution. State v. Rezk, 150 N.H. 483, 486 (2004).', 'Under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, for a defendant’s statement to be admissible at trial, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary. State v. Parker, 160 N.H. 203, 207-08 (2010). Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. Id. at 208. We will not reverse the trial court’s determination of voluntariness unless the determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State. Id.', 'The defendant asserts that her statements should have been suppressed as involuntary based upon two separate grounds. First, she contends the statements were made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality. Second, she contends that the statements were involuntary based upon the totality of the circumstances. We address each argument separately.', 'A', 'Generally, we determine the voluntariness of a statement in light of the totality of all the surrounding circumstances. Parker, 160 N.H. at 208-09. However, the totality of the circumstances test “does not apply to promises of confidentiality.” Id. at 209. Instead, the rule is that a statement “made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary under the State Constitution.” State v. McDermott, 131 N.H. 495, 501 (1989).', 'The defendant argues that Testaverde’s statement “[b]etween me and you and [Molinari]. OK, the three of us in this room, OK, inside, inside your heart . . .” constitutes an impermissible promise of confidentiality. The State disagrees, noting that prior to the interrogation, the defendant was informed of her Miranda rights, including an express warning that what she said could be used against her in court. Further, the State argues, Testaverde never told the defendant, or implied, that her statements would not be used against her criminally and after using the phrase in question, he “quickly changed his language.”', 'We first addressed the issue of police promises of confidentiality in State v. McDermott, where we determined that such a promise renders statements involuntary under the State Constitution. McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501. In McDermott, federal drug agents repeatedly misled the defendant into believing his statements would remain confidential. Id. at 498-99. The defendant was an informant for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Id. at 497. When he initially met with DEA agents to discuss becoming an informant, he was reluctant to provide information about himself or his criminal past. Id. The agents assured him that they had never seen a cooperating individual prosecuted by the DEA. Id. The defendant disclosed most of his criminal past and even admitted to knowing who committed an unsolved homicide, but refused to elaborate on his involvement in the homicide. Id. at 497-98.', 'Later, the defendant had another meeting with a federal DEA agent because he was running out of money. Id. at 498. During this meeting, the agent placed a “pile of money” on the table in front of the defendant and insisted on knowing the details of the unsolved homicide. Id. at 498-99. The agent then assured the defendant that the information he provided “would not leave the office.” Id. at 499. The agent explained “that the DEA simply needed the information . . . to avoid surprises” at trial and that the DEA would never obtain cooperation from informants if it prosecuted them based upon information they provided. Id. The defendant then confessed his involvement in the homicide. After the defendant confessed, the agent told the defendant his statements would not be used against him in court because he did not receive Miranda warnings. Id. The defendant proceeded to elaborate on the details of the murder. Id.', 'A few months later, New Hampshire authorities charged the defendant with first degree murder and attempted to use his statements to the DEA agents against him at trial. See id. at 496-99. On appeal, we held law enforcement may not use a promise of confidentiality to obtain incriminating information. Id. at 501. We determined that under the State Constitution, a promise of confidentiality renders statements made in reliance upon that promise involuntary and inadmissible. See id.', 'In Parker, we applied the McDermott rule. The defendant in Parker was informed that the interview would be recorded and was given Miranda warnings before the interview began. Parker, 160 N.H. at 205. About two hours into the interview, the detective told the defendant that “[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.” Id. at 211 (quotation omitted). The detective then further confirmed the promise of confidentiality by saying to the defendant “what you tell me in here . . . doesn’t have to go to [your mother].” Id. at 205 (quotation omitted).', 'When the defendant did not immediately divulge information, the detective encouraged him to confess by implying that the defendant would not be prosecuted. Id. at 206. Specifically, the detective told the defendant that he needed to know the truth “before [he could] say hey, you know what? This is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. . . . It’s behind him. . . . Get a little counseling and, and it’s over.” Id. The trial court determined “that the detective’s statements merely suggested an atmosphere of confidentiality.” Id. at 210 (quotation omitted). We reversed, finding that the detective’s statement constituted an impermissible promise of confidentiality and, as a result, the defendant’s statements were involuntary. Id.', 'Although the plain meaning of “between me and you” – the phrase uttered by Testaverde during the interrogation – implies that what is said will remain confidential, id. at 211, this case differs from McDermott and Parker. In this case, the phrase was used only once. Testaverde did not repeatedly reassure Hernandez that her statements would remain confidential, and he did not use any language implying confidentiality at any other point during the interview. Nor did he ever imply or state that Hernandez would not be prosecuted for the crime. Indeed, he made it clear from the beginning that her statements could, and incriminating statements would, be used to prosecute her.', 'Although the law remains that a statement made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary, Testaverde’s statement here was not the kind of impermissible promise of confidentiality that renders statements involuntary under the State Constitution. His statement hinted at confidentiality, but did not explicitly promise it. In Parker, the officers promised that all of the defendant’s statements “in [the interrogation room]” would “stay between” the defendant and the officers, specifically promised that the defendant’s statements would not be revealed to his mother, and later suggested that the defendant would only be required to get “a little counseling.” Parker, 160 N.H. at 211. In McDermott, the officer not only promised that the defendant’s statements would not leave the room, but also promised that without Miranda warnings, these statements would not be used against the defendant. McDermott, 131 N.H. at 499. Here, however, Testaverde used a phrase one time that, at most, implied confidentiality. While we continue to discourage the police from using this type of language, and will continue to examine possible police promises of confidentiality closely, we conclude that in the narrow circumstances of this case, Testaverde’s use of the phrase “between you and me” did not rise to the level of such a promise. The trial court properly denied the defendant’s motion to suppress.', 'B', 'The defendant also argues that her statements were involuntary because in addition to the statement alluding to confidentiality, the totality of the other circumstances surrounding the interview rendered the statements involuntary. Specifically, among other things, the defendant argues that her statements were coerced because she had no prior experience with police, she hit her head on the steering wheel during a serious car accident less than twelve hours before the interrogation, there was no evidence as to whether she had any sleep before the interrogation, and during the interrogation, the police employed minimization and other similar techniques.', '“In determining whether a [statement] is voluntary, we look at whether the actions of an individual are the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice . . . .” Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487 (quotation omitted). A confession is involuntary if it is “the product of a will overborne by police tactics, or of a mind incapable of a conscious choice.” Parker, 160 N.H. at 208 (quotation omitted). In making a voluntariness determination, the court considers the totality of all surrounding circumstances, including the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation. Id.', 'The evidence supports the determination that the defendant’s statements to the police were voluntary. At the interview, the defendant was allowed a blanket, and was given food and drink. Although the defendant apparently did not have any prior experience with police, she is of at least average intelligence. While lack of police experience is certainly a factor to be considered, it does not necessarily imply that the defendant cannot make a meaningful choice. Cf. State v. Damiano, 124 N.H. 742, 747 (1984) (holding mental illness does not render a confession involuntary as a matter of law). Further, despite the fact that the defendant had been drinking the night before, there was no evidence that she was drunk or significantly impaired at the time of the interview. Cf. State v. Chapman, 135 N.H. 390, 401 (1992) (confession voluntary even though defendant was inebriated at the time of confession).', 'The interview itself was “not an inordinate or oppressive length” – it lasted less than two hours. See Chapman, 135 N.H. at 401 (finding a two and a half hour interview was not oppressive or inordinate). At the beginning of the interview, Testaverde read and carefully explained the meaning of her Miranda rights and obtained a waiver. While compliance with Miranda does not conclusively establish that a defendant’s subsequent statement was voluntary, it is one of the factors the trial court may consider. State v. Bilodeau, 159 N.H. 759, 764 (2010). The detectives never promised the defendant leniency and, as we explained above, the single reference to confidentiality did not taint the entire interrogation. Further, the interrogation was not hostile. See Chapman, 135 N.H. at 401. At the end of the interview, even Hernandez agreed that the detectives treated her with respect throughout. See State v. Hall, 148 N.H. 671, 673 (2003). Although the detectives admittedly used minimization techniques and were “friendly” to the defendant, the police are not prohibited from misleading a suspect, id., and friendly police conduct does not alter the voluntariness of a defendant’s statements. State v. Hammond, 144 N.H. 401, 405-06 (1999).', 'In this case, the evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant’s statements were the product of a free and unconstrained choice. Based upon this evidence, we cannot say that the trial court’s determination was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s finding that the defendant’s statements were voluntary.', 'In light of the fact that the State Constitution affords greater protection than does the Federal Constitution, see Hammond, 144 N.H. at 404, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution.', 'II', 'During the initial confrontation in the City Hall parking lot, Colleen Hake, characterized by the parties as a “homeless woman,” was sleeping near the steps of City Hall. The State deposed Hake and planned to call her as a witness at trial. Before trial, the defendant moved to exclude Hake’s testimony on the grounds that Hake was not competent. The court held a competency hearing at which the trial judge found the witness competent to testify, but allowed that his ruling could be revisited.', 'In her motion and at the competency hearing, the defendant presented evidence that Hake had mental health issues and delusional beliefs. For example, at the hearing Hake testified that she did not know how many children she had, and that when she was pregnant, her doctor told her she was pregnant with only one child, but when she gave birth, she saw “about six” babies taken out of the delivery room. Hake also testified that she believed her mother was abducted and replaced by an imposter who looked like her real mother.', 'After the hearing, but before Hake testified at trial, the trial judge conducted a voir dire outside the jury’s presence to revisit competency. During voir dire, Hake testified that she understood that she was under oath and accurately answered questions aimed at determining whether she understood the difference between the truth and a lie. Hake was not further questioned about her mental health problems or her delusional beliefs during voir dire. The trial judge again concluded the witness was competent to testify, explaining, “I have no question as to this witness’ understanding of her obligation to tell the truth and her ability to do so.” On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found Hake competent to testify.', 'When the record contains evidence to support the trial court’s determination of competency, we will not overturn that determination absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. State v. Mills, 136 N.H. 46, 49-50 (1992). “[M]uch depends on the trial court’s firsthand observations of the witness.” State v. Briere, 138 N.H. 617, 620 (1994). Because the trial court is in the unique position of being able to directly observe the witness, “its conclusion that the witness is competent is entitled to great deference.” Id.', 'New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 601 creates a presumption that witnesses are competent. See N.H. R. Ev. 601(b). This presumption can be overcome by findings that the witness “lacks sufficient capacity to observe, remember and narrate as well as understand the duty to tell the truth.” Id. Implicit in an understanding of the duty to tell the truth is an understanding of the distinction between the truth and a lie. State v. Horak, 159 N.H. 576, 579 (2010). The focus of a competency determination is whether the witness possesses such an understanding.', 'In this case, the trial court held a hearing on the motion to exclude the witness’s testimony and later conducted voir dire of the witness during the trial. At both the hearing and voir dire, the court was able to observe the witness. Although the witness had mental health problems and some delusional beliefs, the presumption of competency is not rebutted merely because a witness may be mentally ill. State v. Keyes, 114 N.H. 487, 490-91 (1974) (“[A]lthough at one time an insane person was incompetent to testify, the present rule is that one who is insane . . . may testify if the trial judge finds he [understands the duty to tell the truth].”). The record supports that the witness understood her duty to tell the truth and the trial judge’s determination that the witness was competent to testify was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

Gorman, senior assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the defendant.', 'LYNN, J. The petitioner, Donald Gentry, appeals the decision of the Superior Court (Bornstein, J.) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court held that the petitioner, an offender whose parole was revoked by the parole board, was not entitled to receive credit against the ninety-day term of recommitment to prison imposed pursuant to RSA chapter 651-A:19, I (Supp. 2010) for the period between his arrest and revocation of his parole. 1 We affirm.', 'I', 'The pertinent facts are not in dispute. The petitioner was arrested on a parole violation warrant on October 13, 2010, and confined in prison until he received a parole revocation hearing on December 7, 2010. Following the hearing, the parole board recommitted the petitioner to prison for ninety days pursuant to RSA 651-A:19, I (Supp. 2010). The petitioner requested that the fifty-five days 2 he spent in confinement before the hearing be credited against the ninety-day recommitment period. The board denied that request, and the superior court upheld the board’s decision, ruling that “inmates are not entitled to pre-hearing confinement credit against the 90-day recommitment period but against only the maximum sentence.” This appeal followed.', 'II', 'We review the trial court’s statutory interpretation de novo. State v. Beauchemin, 161 N.H. 654, 658 (2011). We are the final arbiters of legislative intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. Id. When interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. We do not read words or phrases in isolation, but in the context of the entire statutory scheme. New Hampshire Health Care Assoc. v. Governor, 161 N.H. 378, 385 (2011). When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we do not look beyond it for further indications of legislative intent. Id.', 'As amended by Laws 2010, 247:10, RSA 651-A:19, I, provided: 3', 'A prisoner who is recommitted shall serve 90 days in', 'prison before being placed back on parole or the remainder', 'of his or her maximum sentence, whichever is shorter. The 1 At oral argument, the State advised that, as of that date, the petitioner had completed his maximum sentence. Despite this, we do not regard the case as moot, because, given the short ninety-day recommitment mandated by the statute, the petitioner’s position that he is entitled to have the period of pre-hearing incarceration deducted from the sentence clearly is capable of repetition yet evading review. See Asmussen v. Comm’r, N.H. Dep’t of Safety, 145 N.H. 578, 590- 91 (2000). 2 RSA 651-A:17 (2007 and Supp. 2011) requires that revocation hearings be held within forty-five days after a parolee is arrested for a parole violation. The record does not indicate why this time limit was not met in the instant case, but the petitioner does not challenge his parole revocation based on the failure to hold a timely hearing. 3 In 2011, RSA 651-A:19 was substantially amended. See Laws 2011, 244:3 (effective July 13, 2011).', 'time between the return of the parolee to prison after arrest', 'and revocation of parole shall be considered as time served', 'as a portion of the maximum sentence. The petitioner argues that his pre-hearing confinement should have been credited toward the ninety-day recommitment period because the term “maximum sentence” in the second sentence of RSA 651-A:19, I necessarily includes the ninety-day recommitment period. He contends that the distinction drawn by the trial court between the ninety-day recommitment period and the maximum sentence “is neither one made in the statute nor cognizable at law.”', 'The familiar doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (“the mention of one thing excludes another”) persuades us that the trial court’s interpretation of the statute is correct. In the first sentence of RSA 651-A:19, I, the legislature adopted a maximum recommitment period of the shorter of ninety days or the remainder of the maximum sentence for offenders found to have violated their parole conditions. The second sentence of the statute explains that whatever time the parolee spent confined after arrest but before revocation of parole is to be credited against the maximum sentence. In light of the reference in the first sentence to both the maximum sentence and the ninety-day recommitment period, the inclusion of only “maximum sentence” in the second sentence, addressing how to apply credit for time served post- arrest/pre-revocation, indicates that the legislature intended this credit to be applied solely to reduce the maximum sentence and not to reduce the recommitment period (unless necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum sentence). See 2A N. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:23, at 417 (7th ed. 2007) (“The force of the maxim [expressio unius est exclusio alterius] is strengthened where a thing is provided in one part of the statute and omitted in another.”). This conclusion is reinforced by RSA 651-A:17 (Supp. 2010), which makes it clear that the recommitment period begins only when, after a hearing, the board formally revokes the prisoner’s parole: “A prisoner whose parole is revoked shall be recommitted to the custody of the commissioner of corrections.” (Emphasis added.)', 'We also reject the petitioner’s contention that our reading of the statute leads to absurd results. While we agree that some parolees will serve more time in confinement than others based solely on how quickly after arrest they receive a revocation hearing, the plight of parole violators who must wait longer for a hearing is not meaningfully different from that of parolees who are arrested and detained for a violation but are ultimately exonerated at their revocation hearings. Like the petitioner, parolees in the latter category receive nothing more than credit against the maximum sentence for their pre-hearing incarceration – despite the fact that, in retrospect, it has been determined they should not have been re-incarcerated at all. In the absence of any suggestion of parole board revocation hearings being improperly delayed, the fact that some parolees serve more time in custody than others is an unfortunate consequence of a system that cannot act instantaneously and occasionally errs. Cf. People v. Idziak, 773 N.W.2d 616, 629-30 & n. 23 (Mich. 2009) (rejecting constitutional challenge to Michigan’s procedure for calculating sentences when a parolee commits a new offense while on release even though methodology may result in some defendants serving more prison time than others based on “‘arbitrary’ factors, such as the degree of docket congestion”).', 'Because we agree with the trial court’s conclusion that RSA 651-A:19 did not permit the parole board to credit the time the petitioner spent in confinement between his arrest and revocation of his parole against his ninety- day recommitment period, we need not address the petitioner’s objections to the parole board’s view that it retained discretion to award such time against the ninety-day recommitment period.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

On appeal, he argues that the Trial Court (Tucker, J.) erred in denying his motion to suppress inculpatory statements he made to an informant. We affirm.', 'On January 2, 2007, Aaron Kar was shot to death while standing with friends outside an apartment building in Manchester. The Manchester police suspected that the defendant was involved and questioned him about the incident on several occasions shortly after the shooting. During the following year, the police continued to investigate the crime.', 'Between October 1 and November 8, 2007, an undercover officer with the New Hampshire Drug Task Force purchased crack cocaine from the defendant six times as part of an ongoing investigation into the defendant’s drug trafficking. However, the defendant was not arrested or charged with these crimes at this time.', 'Subsequently, on November 24, a sergeant with the Manchester Police Department received information from the informant, an inmate at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections, that he knew something about the January 2 shooting. Over the next few weeks, members of the Manchester Police Department met with the informant to discuss what he knew. The informant offered, in exchange for leniency on his pending charges, to provide the police with information about who shot Kar and the person who provided the murder weapon. The informant then provided the police with specific details about the shooting, including that he knew the defendant and that the defendant had claimed to be the person who shot Kar.', 'On February 4, 2008, the informant met with police and prosecutors to discuss recording a conversation between himself and the defendant. The police planned for this conversation to occur at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections after the defendant’s arrest on drug charges. During this meeting, the police suggested ways in which the informant could get the defendant to talk about the murder. They also specifically told the informant not to talk to the defendant about the drug charges for which he was to be arrested.', 'On February 7, 2008, the defendant was arrested for the sale of controlled drugs and detained at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections. He was arraigned the next day and counsel was appointed for him on February 9.', 'On February 11, an assistant attorney general authorized a one-party intercept to make an audio recording of a conversation between the informant and the defendant that day. See RSA 570-A:2, II(d) (2001). While the authorization stated that there was “reasonable suspicion that evidence of the crime of drug sales and/or homicide w[ould] be derived from this interception,” the assistant attorney general later testified that the language referring to the crime of drug sales was “a typo” and the authorization “was intended to only be issued for the homicide.” She further stated that she “was very clear” that during the conversation the informant was “not to go near the drug sales for which the [d]efendant was . . . incarcerated.”', 'After obtaining the authorization, the police arranged to have the informant and the defendant placed in the same cell. They met with the informant once more and reiterated the instruction that he not discuss the defendant’s drug charges. Upon being placed in the cell together, the defendant and the informant began conversing. Notwithstanding the explicit instructions to the contrary, the informant began discussing the defendant’s drug charges and intermittently discussed them throughout the conversation. As the conversation continued, the defendant made statements implicating himself in Kar’s murder, including admitting that he was the shooter. On February 13, the Manchester Police Department obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant for the charge of first-degree murder; he was indicted on the murder and attempted first-degree assault charges on May 16, 2008.', 'Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the recorded statements, arguing that any statements he made in response to the informant’s questions about the drug charges were elicited in violation of his right to counsel on those charges. He contended that any statements made after this violation, including statements about the shooting, were the fruit of that violation and, therefore, must be suppressed as the “fruit of the poisonous tree.” He further argued that “[t]he [S]tate’s conduct in this case was fundamentally unfair and thus a violation of due process.” (Bolding omitted.)', 'The State conceded that the defendant’s right to counsel had attached with respect to the drug charges and, thus, any discussion between the informant and the defendant relating to the drug charges would be inadmissible at a trial on those charges. The State later represented that it would not introduce any portions of the conversation related to the drug charges at trial on the charges related to the shooting. The State maintained, however, that because the defendant’s right to counsel had not yet attached on the charges related to the shooting, there had been no violation of his right to counsel on those charges and the statements related to the shooting were admissible. The State also argued that its actions did not constitute a due process violation.', 'Following a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant’s motion. The court found that the defendant’s right to counsel had attached on the drug charges and, “[a]s a result, [the informant’s] inquiries constituted impermissible interrogation with respect to that case.” Nevertheless, the court found that when the defendant spoke with the informant, he was not charged with any crime related to the shooting and, “since the right to counsel is ‘offense specific,’ the right to counsel had not attached in connection with the murder charges.” (Citation omitted.) The court further found that the defendant’s statements to the informant were not involuntary and that “the investigative tactic used in this case did not violate the defendant’s state or federal rights to due process.”', '“When reviewing a trial court’s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the trial court’s factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous. Our review of the trial court’s legal conclusions, however, is de novo.” State v. Matey, 153 N.H. 263, 268 (2006) (quotation omitted).', 'The defendant argues on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He asserts that the informant’s questions about his pending drug charges violated his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, and that his statements about the shooting should have been excluded as “fruit of the poisonous tree.” He further argues that “[a]llowing the State to intentionally violate the constitutional rights of an accused in order to elicit incriminating statements is fundamentally unfair and violates due process.” We first address the defendant’s claims under the State Constitution, State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983), and cite federal opinions for guidance only. Id. at 231-33.', 'The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” U.S. CONST. amend. VI; McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 175 (1991). The State counterpart of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel provides:', 'Every person held to answer in any crime or offense punishable by', 'deprivation of liberty shall have the right to counsel at the expense', 'of the state if need is shown; this right he is at liberty to waive, but', 'only after the matter has been thoroughly explained by the court. N.H. CONST. pt. I, art 15.', 'A criminal defendant’s right to counsel under both the State and Federal Constitutions attaches when adversary proceedings have commenced through a formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. State v. Jeleniewski, 147 N.H. 462, 467-68 (2002); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1977). This right is designed to give a defendant the benefit of legal advice when making important decisions regarding his case. Jeleniewski, 147 N.H. at 468; United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180, 188-89 (1984) (recognizing “that the core purpose of the counsel guarantee is to assure aid at trial, when the accused is confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor” (quotations and brackets omitted)).', 'Once the right has attached, the assistance of counsel is provided at critical stages of criminal proceedings in order to preserve a defendant’s right to a fair trial, Jeleniewski, 147 N.H. at 468; Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 170 (1985), and absent a waiver of this right by a defendant, any knowing government interrogation of a defendant after attachment, without the presence of counsel, is improper, see State v. Bruneau, 131 N.H. 104, 108 (1988); Moulton, 474 U.S. at 176. This rule applies equally to direct and “indirect and surreptitious interrogations as well as those conducted in the jailhouse” through the use of informants. United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 273 (1980) (quotation omitted); see Bruneau, 131 N.H. at 108. Thus, “[b]y intentionally creating a situation likely to induce [a defendant] to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel, the Government violate[s]” a defendant’s right to counsel. Henry, 447 U.S. at 274. This is so “even where the government expressly instructs its informant not to initiate any conversations with the accused and not to question him regarding the pending charges.” United States v. Terzado-Madruga, 897 F.2d 1099, 1109 (11th Cir. 1990).', 'The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that “the Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] is ‘offense specific.’” Matey, 153 N.H. at 269 (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162, 164 (2001)); McNeil, 501 U.S. at 175. While we have implicitly held that the right to counsel under Part I, Article 15 is also “offense specific,” see Matey, 153 N.H. at 269-71, we now explicitly adopt, under our constitution, the “offense specific” nature of the right to counsel. This means that the right to counsel attaches only to offenses for which prosecution has commenced and “cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions.” McNeil, 501 U.S. at 175. Thus, a “defendant’s statements regarding offenses for which he [has] not been charged [are] admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses.” Matey, 153 N.H. at 270 (quotation omitted).', 'Nevertheless, there may be times when interrogation on uncharged offenses “might encroach on the defendant’s rights concerning the pending charges.” Thompson v. State, 93 S.W.3d 16, 24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). This issue was recognized by the Supreme Court in Moulton. There, the Court “considered the constitutional implications of a surreptitious investigation that yielded evidence pertaining to two crimes. For one, the defendant had been indicted; for the other, he had not.” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 431 (1986) (discussing Moulton). The Court held that the defendant’s right to counsel was violated by the admission of incriminating statements he made to his codefendant, who was acting as a government informant, concerning the crime for which he had been indicted, even though the police had recorded the meeting with the informant to gain information on a separate uncharged crime. Moulton, 474 U.S. at 176-80.', 'In so doing, the Court stated:', 'The police have an interest in the thorough investigation of crimes', 'for which formal charges have already been filed. They also have', 'an interest in investigating new or additional crimes.', 'Investigations of either type of crime may require surveillance of', 'individuals already under indictment. Moreover, law enforcement', 'officials investigating an individual suspected of committing one', 'crime and formally charged with having committed another crime', 'obviously seek to discover evidence useful at a trial of either crime.', 'In seeking evidence pertaining to pending charges, however, the', 'Government’s investigative powers are limited by the Sixth', 'Amendment rights of the accused. To allow the admission of', 'evidence obtained from the accused in violation of his Sixth', 'Amendment rights whenever the police assert an alternative,', 'legitimate reason for their surveillance invites abuse by law', 'enforcement personnel in the form of fabricated investigations and', 'risks the evisceration of the Sixth Amendment right recognized in', '[Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964)]. On the other', 'hand, to exclude evidence pertaining to charges as to which the', 'Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the', 'evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending', 'at that time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public’s interest in', 'the investigation of criminal activities. Consequently,', 'incriminating statements pertaining to pending charges are', 'inadmissible at the trial of those charges, notwithstanding the fact', 'that the police were also investigating other crimes, if, in obtaining', 'this evidence, the State violated the Sixth Amendment by', 'knowingly circumventing the accused’s right to the assistance of', 'counsel. Moulton, 474 U.S. at 179-80. The court noted in a footnote that “[i]ncriminating statements pertaining to other crimes, as to which the Sixth Amendment right has not yet attached, are, of course, admissible at a trial of those offenses.” Id. at 180 n.16. The Court reaffirmed this reasoning in Moran when it explained that Moulton “made clear . . . that the evidence concerning the crime for which the defendant had not been indicted — evidence obtained in precisely the same manner from the identical suspect — would be admissible at a trial limited to those charges.” Moran, 475 U.S. at 431; see McNeil, 501 U.S. at 176.', 'There is no dispute that the defendant’s right to counsel had attached with respect to the drug charges and that this right was violated by the informant’s questioning of the defendant about those charges. Indeed, the State concedes that “during any proceedings on the drug charges, the evidence that the informant elicited could not be used.” However, because judicial proceedings had not yet commenced against the defendant with respect to the shooting, his right to counsel had not attached as to those charges. Accordingly, the informant’s questioning of the defendant regarding the shooting did not violate his right to counsel and his statements as to the shooting were admissible at the trial on those charges. See McNeil, 501 U.S. at 176; State v. Kilgus, 128 N.H. 577, 593-94 (1986) (finding no violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel when informant elicited statements from the defendant about uncharged attempted murder even though defendant was already charged with witness tampering).', 'Nonetheless, the defendant maintains that “[t]he statements about the shooting followed [the informant’s] numerous references to the drug charges” and, as a result, “only occur[red] though [the] violation of [the defendant’s] right to counsel” on those charges. Thus, he urges us to apply the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine and hold that his statements concerning the shooting should have been suppressed. In making this argument, he relies upon a number of cases. See, e.g., Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004); Fellers v. United States, 540 U.S. 519 (2004); Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984); Henry, 447 U.S. 264; Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967); Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293 (1966); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963); State v. Panarello, 157 N.H. 204 (2008); State v. Roache, 148 N.H. 45 (2002); State v. Gravel, 135 N.H. 172 (1991); State v. Baillargeon, 124 N.H. 355 (1983). None of these cases, however, stands for the proposition that statements regarding uncharged offenses, elicited at the same time as statements regarding charged offenses for which there was a violation of a defendant’s right to counsel, constitute a “fruit” of that violation. And we decline to adopt such a rule.', 'This decision is consistent with “the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.” United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 364 (1981). The Supreme Court’s approach in addressing violations of the Sixth Amendment has “been to identify and then neutralize the taint by tailoring relief appropriate in the circumstances to assure the defendant the effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial.” Id. at 365. Accordingly, the Court has looked to whether “the constitutional infringement identified has had or threatens some adverse effect upon the effectiveness of counsel’s representation or has produced some other prejudice to the defense.” Id. “Absent such impact on the criminal proceeding, however, there is no basis for imposing a remedy in that proceeding, which can go forward with full recognition of the defendant’s right to counsel and to a fair trial.” Id.', 'The defendant’s right to counsel in this case was violated on the drug charges. The appropriate remedy for this constitutional violation was to exclude evidence obtained from this violation from trial on those charges. However, there was no violation with respect to the shooting charges. Accordingly, “[t]here is no effect of a constitutional dimension which needs to be purged to make certain that [the defendant] has been effectively represented and not unfairly convicted.” Id. at 366.', 'Citing Gilbert, the defendant argues that “[t]he offense-specific rule does not affect application of the exclusionary rule: statements taken in violation of the right to counsel are not admissible in any case.” The simple answer to this argument is that, as discussed above, there was no right-to-counsel violation with respect to the statements concerning the shooting.', 'The defendant argues that we should find the State Constitution more protective than the Federal Constitution under these circumstances. He maintains that the above-quoted provision of Part I, Article 15 is “more broadly-worded than the federal constitution” and that we have “taken a more protective view of the right to counsel under the state constitution” with respect to custodial interrogations and the right against self-incrimination. He further contends that we have implemented the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine “in a more protective manner than the Supreme Court.” We do not disagree. However, we have never construed the state constitutional right to counsel as arising earlier than the Sixth Amendment right to counsel; nor have we found that the use of an informant, in and of itself, violates our constitution. We decline to do either in this case.', 'Finally, the defendant argues that “[s]anctioning the State’s actions here would permit a knowing violation of the law for the purpose of eliciting incriminating statements from a suspect,” and that “[s]uch a holding would not comport with due process.” The New Hampshire Constitution guarantees every citizen due process of the law. State v. Damiano, 124 N.H. 742, 746 (1984); N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. The standard for determining whether a law or procedure violates due process is whether it is fundamentally fair. State v. Barnett, 147 N.H. 334, 336 (2001). Fundamental fairness requires that the government conduct conform to the community’s sense of justice, decency and fair play. State v. Mwangi, 161 N.H. 699, 703 (2011).', 'The defendant contends that, under the decision in this case, “the State . . . has every incentive to intentionally violate a suspect’s right to counsel on one charge in order to elicit inculpatory statements about an uncharged crime” and “may decide that foregoing use of a defendant’s statements in violation of the right to counsel is a small price to pay in order to purchase the defendant’s trust in an informant on a different charge.” Undoubtedly, the informant’s conduct in this case violated the defendant’s right to counsel with respect to the drug charges. We do not find, however, that these facts demonstrate “the kind of misbehavior that so shocks the sensibilities of civilized society” as to constitute a due process violation. Moran, 475 U.S. at 433-34.', 'Moreover, the State’s use of an informant does not constitute a per se constitutional violation. See Hoffa, 385 U.S. at 311 (“the use of secret informers is not per se unconstitutional”); State v. Lewis, 129 N.H. 787, 798 (1987) (same). As we have previously stated, “fundamental unfairness does not occur for purposes of the due process clause simply because a defendant places himself at a disadvantage under circumstances in which there are no substantive constitutional violations.” Lewis, 129 N.H. at 798.', 'As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does our State Constitution under these circumstances, see Matey, 153 N.H. at 271; Barnett, 147 N.H. at 336; McNeil, 501 U.S. at 175; Moran, 475 U.S. at 432-34, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.

Delaney, attorney general (Elizabeth C. Woodcock, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Shaheen & Gordon, P.A., of Concord (James D. Rosenberg on the brief and orally), for the defendant.', 'DALIANIS, C.J. The defendant, Jonathan Ball, appeals his conviction, following a bench trial upon stipulated facts, on one felony count of possessing child sexual abuse images (child pornography). See RSA 649-A:3, I(a) (Supp. 2011). On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court (Smukler, J.) erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence derived from the search of his home computer. We affirm. I. Background', 'The following facts are derived primarily from the affidavit submitted to support the warrant to search the defendant’s computer. On July 29, 2009, the Concord police received a complaint that a man with a vehicle bearing New Hampshire license plate “WOODFLR” had masturbated in front of the complainant, showed the complainant numerous digital images of female children engaged in sexual activity, and asked the complainant if he would like to have sex with minor girls. The man also told the complainant that he had been having sex with his fifteen-year-old step-daughter since she was ten years old.', 'After running the license plate number through the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles’ computer system, the police discovered that the plate was registered to Robert Johnston. On July 31, 2009, the police executed a warrant to search his home. While there, the police interviewed his step- daughter, who confirmed that Johnston had been sexually abusing her since she was in sixth grade. The step-daughter told the police that “at some point,” Johnston took nude photographs of her and sent them to others using his cellular telephone; she said that some of these photographs were sexually explicit.', 'The step-daughter also described engaging in sexual activity with Johnston on July 28, 2009, in the presence of a man named “John.” Specifically, she described performing oral sex on Johnston in his parked vehicle while John stood outside the vehicle and masturbated. She stated that then John inserted his hand in her vagina. She told the police that on that same day, she and Johnston went to John’s house in Pembroke and had sexual intercourse in John’s bedroom. The step-daughter said that John joined her and Johnston on the bed and masturbated while he watched them have sex.', 'The step-daughter told the police that John’s bedroom is located on the second floor and that to access it one has to walk through a sitting room in which there is a computer. The step-daughter told the police that on July 31, 2009, she observed John and Johnston “exchange[ ] messages by phone.” The step-daughter said that John drove a yellow SUV with the license plate “AJ- WINGS.”', 'On August 3, 2009, the police learned that a yellow SUV with the license plate “AJ-WINGS” is registered to the defendant. The police also found the defendant’s Pembroke address. Based upon all of this information, the police submitted an application for a warrant to search the defendant’s home, computer, and cell phone for evidence of child pornography. The Hooksett District Court granted the application on August 4, 2009.', 'The search of the defendant’s computer revealed one computer file containing four images and two videos of children engaging in sexual acts. The search also revealed e-mails between the account on the defendant’s computer and another online account describing sexual encounters involving a female of unknown age and a man named “Bob” who drove a truck with the license plate, “woodflr.” II. Discussion', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution by denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home computer. He asserts that the affidavit in support of the warrant application failed to set forth sufficient facts linking any child pornography to his computer. We first address the defendant’s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).', 'A. Standard of Review', 'Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution requires that search warrants be issued only upon a finding of probable cause. State v. Ward, 163 N.H. 156, 159 (2012). Probable cause exists if a person of ordinary caution would justifiably believe that what is sought will be found through the search and will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction. Id. “The police must demonstrate in an application for a search warrant that there is a substantial likelihood that the items sought will be found in the place to be searched.” State v. Fish, 142 N.H. 524, 527-28 (1994). “However, they need not establish with certainty, or even beyond a reasonable doubt, that the search will lead to the desired result.” Id. at 528 (quotation omitted).', 'We apply a totality-of-the-circumstances test to review the sufficiency of an affidavit submitted with a warrant application. Id. The task of the issuing district court is to “make a practical, common-sense decision whether given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before [it], including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983); see Fish, 142 N.H. at 528.', '“Our duty as the reviewing court is . . . to ensure that the [district court] had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.” Ward, 163 N.H. at 162 (quotation omitted); see Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39. Nevertheless, under this standard we “may properly conclude that . . . [a] warrant was invalid because the [district court’s] probable-cause determination reflected an improper analysis of the totality of the circumstances.” United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 915 (1984). “While an affidavit may establish probable cause without the observance of contraband at the location to be searched,” to meet constitutional muster, “affidavits must establish a sufficient nexus between the illicit objects and the place to be searched.” Ward, 163 N.H. at 160. As a reviewing court, we may consider only the information that the police brought to the issuing court’s attention (here, the district court). See United States v. Jacobson, 466 U.S. 109, 112 n.2 (1984).', 'We review the superior court’s order de novo except with respect to any controlling factual findings. Ward, 163 N.H. at 159. In this case, we review the superior court’s decision de novo as there were no controlling facts determined by it in the first instance. See Fish, 142 N.H. at 528.', 'We afford much deference to the district court’s probable cause determination and will not invalidate warrants by reading the supporting affidavit in a hypertechnical sense. Ward, 163 N.H. at 159. “Rather, we review the affidavit in a common-sense manner, and determine close cases by the preference to be accorded to warrants.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'B. Affidavit', 'The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence linking the contraband (child pornography) to the location to be searched (his computer). See Ward, 163 N.H. at 160. However, his argument depends upon a hypertechnical reading of the supporting affidavit. Reviewing the totality of the circumstances, and in light of the deference accorded to the district court’s finding of probable cause and the preference to be accorded to warrants, we conclude that the district court had a substantial basis for believing that the warrant was supported by probable cause. See id. at 159.', 'In arguing that the search warrant failed to establish a sufficient nexus between child pornography and the defendant’s computer, the defendant relies primarily upon State v. Silvestri, 136 N.H. 522, 526-28 (1992), and Ward, 163 N.H. at 160-61. Silvestri concerned a search of a defendant’s residence for evidence of controlled drugs. Silvestri, 136 N.H. at 523-24. We observed that the only fact alleged in the affidavit that referred to the defendant’s residence was the telephone number the informant dialed to buy marijuana. Id. at 524, 526. The affidavit did not allege that the telephone number the informant dialed was the number servicing the defendant’s residence, as opposed to his office or cell phone numbers. Id. at 526. Notably, the informant never stated that he or she saw drugs at the defendant’s residence or that the informant believed that the defendant kept drugs there. Id. We concluded that even if the magistrate had reasonably inferred that the telephone number was the defendant’s home number, this, alone, was insufficient to establish the required nexus between the defendant’s home and his drug-dealing activities. Id. at 526-28. Accordingly, we held that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search. Id. at 526-28.', 'Ward concerned the search of a defendant’s home and computer for evidence of child pornography. Ward, 163 N.H. at 157. We concluded that Ward was distinguishable from Silvestri because, in Ward, there were several alleged facts connecting the defendant’s home and computer to child pornographic images. Id. at 160.', 'In Ward, although no child pornography was seen on the defendant’s computer or in his residence, child pornography was found in his garage, and there were facts linking this pornography to a computer and linking a computer to the defendant’s residence. Id. at 160-61. Specifically, a neighbor saw two pieces of paper in the defendant’s garage, which depicted sexually explicit photographs of a nude girl, and which appeared to have been printed out from a computer. Id. at 160-61. Moreover, the neighbor did not see any computer equipment in the garage, but had observed the defendant using a laptop computer in his home. Id. at 161. Considering the totality of these circumstances, and viewing this information in a common-sense manner, we concluded that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that the requisite probable cause existed. Id. at 159, 160-61.', 'Here, as in Ward, there was no child pornography observed on the defendant’s computer; however, there are “other circumstances that would support the inference” that child pornography was located there. Id. at 160 (quotation omitted). Specifically, the affidavit alleged that Johnston’s cell phone contained sexually explicit images of children and that he used it to transmit such images to others. The affidavit also alleged that Johnston and the defendant exchanged messages. These facts are sufficient to support an inference that Johnston used his cell phone to transmit at least one sexually explicit image of a child to the defendant’s cell phone.', 'The affidavit also alleged that the defendant touched the minor victim sexually and watched her and Johnston engage in sexual activity. This fact supports an inference that the defendant is also interested in images of child sexual activity.', 'Finally, the affidavit included the officer’s assertion based upon his training and experience that those who “have demonstrated an interest or preference in sexual activity with children . . . are likely to keep secreted, but readily at hand, sexually explicit visual images depicting children,” which they often “carry . . . upon their person in the form of USB drives or other media storage devices,” and that persons receiving such images will copy them onto their computers’ hard drives. Based upon the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that the affidavit afforded the district court a substantial basis for believing that the defendant’s computer contained child pornography. See id. at 159, 160-61.', 'In arguing for a contrary result, the defendant relies upon cases from other jurisdictions concluding that evidence of child molestation alone does not establish probable cause for a search warrant for child pornography. See, e.g., United States v. Hodson, 543 F.3d 286, 292 (6th Cir. 2008). But see United States v. Colbert, 605 F.3d 573, 578 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1469 (2011). The defendant’s reliance upon this case law is, however, misplaced. In the instant case, there was evidence not only that the defendant molested the minor victim, but also that he watched Johnston molest her while he masturbated. In other words, there was evidence that the defendant was a voyeur of child sexual activity.', 'The defendant also relies upon cases from other jurisdictions ruling that an officer’s general conclusions based upon his training and expertise are relevant to the probable cause determination only when they are supported by particularized facts. See United States v. Zimmerman, 277 F.3d 426, 433 n.4 (3d Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Clark, 668 F.3d 934, 935-37, 939-40 (7th Cir. 2012). He contends that in this case, there were no particularized facts to justify reliance upon the officer’s general conclusions. Assuming that we were to follow the law from these jurisdictions, we disagree. In addition to the officer’s conclusions, there was evidence that the defendant molested the minor victim, watched her have sex with Johnston while he masturbated, and exchanged messages with Johnston who used his cell phone to transmit sexually explicit images of children to others.', 'As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than the State Constitution does under these circumstances, see Ward, 163 N.H. at 163, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.', 'Affirmed.', 'HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

McGinnis, senior assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Pamela E. Phelan, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'HICKS, J. The defendant, Jack T. Ward, was convicted on thirteen counts of possessing child pornography. See RSA 649-A:3 (2007) (amended 2008). He appeals, arguing that the Superior Court (Smukler, J.) erred in denying his motion to suppress on the grounds that the affidavit supporting the application for a search warrant lacked probable cause to search his residence and his computer. We affirm.', 'On September 12, 2007, Officer Gary Allen of the Pembroke Police Department received a call from a pastor at a church in Pembroke. The pastor told Allen that he had received a call from a parishioner named Allen Brown and that Brown told him that he saw what appeared to be child pornography in his neighbor’s garage.', 'After speaking with the pastor, Allen telephoned Brown. Brown identified the defendant as his neighbor and told Allen that he and the defendant had a verbal agreement that they could go into each other’s garage to borrow tools. On September 10, he went into the defendant’s detached garage to borrow a drill and noticed a stack of magazines on the floor. There were several pieces of paper on top of the magazines that contained pictures of a female juvenile performing sexual acts on adult men. It appeared to Brown that the pictures were printed from a computer.', 'Allen asked Brown if he would come to the police station for an interview and Brown agreed. Later that day, Detective Dawn Shea confirmed that the residence identified by Brown was owned by the defendant and his wife.', 'On September 13, Allen and Shea met with Brown at the police station. Brown reiterated the information he had provided Allen regarding his relationship with the defendant. He explained that when he went to the defendant’s garage on September 10, he saw a piece of paper on top of a pile of magazines that appeared to be longer than standard size paper and printed from a computer. He stated that one of the papers contained a photograph of a nude girl between the ages of twelve and fourteen lying on a white sheet and the other had a photograph of what appeared to be the same girl performing oral sex on a nude adult male. The magazines appeared to be pornographic in nature but Brown could not identify if they were adult or child pornography magazines.', 'Brown also indicated that the defendant and his wife each have a laptop computer, which they use on a daily basis. He stated that he had observed them using their computers inside their house; however, he had never seen any computer equipment in the garage. He indicated that at one time the defendant had a desktop computer but that he did not know whether the defendant still owned it. Brown further stated that the defendant spends a lot of time in the garage but that he had never seen the defendant’s wife go into the garage.', 'That same day, Allen applied for a warrant to search the defendant’s motor vehicle, his residence, including the detached garage and a shed, and his person. In the supporting affidavit, Allen described his conversations with Brown. The attachment to the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant outlined the property for which Allen sought the search warrant, which included “[a]ny and all computer equipment” as well as “[c]amera equipment.”', 'A district court judge issued a warrant and members of the Pembroke Police Department executed it on September 14, 2007. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized during the search. After a hearing, the trial court granted the defendant’s motion to the extent that the search warrant affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search the defendant’s motor vehicle and his person, and to search for adult pornography. However, the court found that the affidavit established probable cause to search the defendant’s house and garage and, therefore, the court denied the motion to suppress evidence derived from those searches.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home and any computer in his home because the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of child pornography would be found in those areas as required by Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He argues that there was no information in the affidavit linking the images Brown observed in the garage to the computers Brown said he saw the defendant and his wife using nor was there any information “suggesting [he] stored child pornography in his home or on any computer in his home.” We first address the defendant’s claim under the State Constitution, State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983), and cite federal opinions for guidance only. Ball, 124 N.H. at 232-33.', 'We review the trial court’s order de novo except with respect to any controlling factual findings. State v. Dalling, 159 N.H. 183, 185 (2009). Nevertheless, we afford much deference to a magistrate’s determination of probable cause and will not invalidate warrants by reading the supporting affidavit in a hypertechnical sense. Id. Rather, “we review the affidavit in a common-sense manner, and determine close cases by the preference to be accorded to warrants.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution requires that search warrants be issued only upon a finding of probable cause. State v. Zwicker, 151 N.H. 179, 185 (2004). Probable cause exists if a person of ordinary caution would justifiably believe that what is sought will be found through the search and will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction. State v. Orde, 161 N.H. 260, 269 (2010). To establish probable cause, the affiant need only present the magistrate with sufficient facts and circumstances to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the evidence or contraband sought will be found in the place to be searched. Id. The affiant need not “establish with certainty, or even beyond a reasonable doubt, that the search will lead to the desired result.” State v. Fish, 142 N.H. 524, 528 (1997) (quotation omitted).', 'We utilize a totality-of-the-circumstances test to review the sufficiency of an affidavit submitted in an application for a search warrant. Id.', 'Given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before the', 'magistrate, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of', 'persons supplying hearsay information, was there a fair probability', 'that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the', 'particular place described in the warrant? State v. Silvestri, 136 N.H. 522, 525 (1992) (quotations omitted). While an affidavit may establish probable cause without the observance of contraband at the location to be searched, id. at 527, in order to establish probable cause to search a residence, affidavits must establish a sufficient nexus between the illicit objects and the place to be searched. Dalling, 159 N.H. at 186.', 'Relying upon Silvestri, the defendant argues that “[t]he mere fact that the images found in the garage tended to establish that [he] illegally possessed those images did not, without more, support a finding that there was a fair probability that other such evidence was in his home.” Silvestri, however, is distinguishable from the instant case. Silvestri dealt with a search of the defendant’s residence for evidence of controlled drugs. Silvestri, 136 N.H. at 523-24. As in this case, the defendant argued on appeal that the evidence obtained from the search should have been suppressed because the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application did not establish probable cause to search his residence. Id. at 525. We agreed, finding that “[t]he only fact alleged in the affidavit that possibly refer[red] to the defendant’s residence [wa]s the telephone number dialed by the informant [to purchase marijuana] and confirmed by” an investigating officer. Id. at 526. We found that, even assuming the magistrate drew the inference that the telephone number was the defendant’s home number, the informant did not state that it was his or her belief that drugs were kept at the defendant’s residence or that he or she had seen drugs at the defendant’s residence. Id. Nor did the informant “indicate any other circumstances that would support the inference, by either the affiant or the magistrate, that the defendant stored drugs in his residence.” Id. at 527. We declined the State’s invitation to adopt a per se rule that if a magistrate finds that a person is a drug dealer, then a finding of probable cause to search that person’s residence automatically follows, stating that “we have consistently required some nexus between the defendant’s residence and drug-dealing activities in order to establish probable cause to search the residence.” Id.', 'In the instant case, unlike in Silvestri, while no child pornography was seen on the defendant’s computer or in his residence, there were “other circumstances that would support the inference,” id., that the defendant had evidence of child pornography in these areas. With respect to his computer, the affidavit described Brown’s first-hand observation of two pieces of paper in the defendant’s garage depicting sexually explicit photographs of a nude girl between the ages of twelve and fourteen years old. Brown described the papers as being longer than a standard size piece of paper and as appearing to have been printed off of a computer. He further indicated that he had observed the defendant and his wife using their laptop computers on a daily basis and that he knew the defendant had previously owned a desktop computer but that he was unsure if the defendant still owned it.', 'As to the defendant’s residence, the affidavit averred that Brown had never seen any computer equipment in the garage but that he had observed the defendant using his laptop computer inside the house on a regular basis. Based on the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that the affidavit demonstrates a fair probability that evidence of child pornography would be found in the defendant’s home or on his computer. “While no single piece of evidence may be conclusive, if the pieces seem to fit neatly together, the magistrate may find probable cause that evidence of a crime may be found at the defendant’s home.” State v. Westover, 127 N.H. 130, 132-33 (1985) (neighbor’s testimony regarding frequent visitors at the defendant’s residence and police corroboration that the defendant’s phone number was linked to an ongoing drug investigation by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration enough to establish probable cause to search defendant’s residence).', 'The defendant further argues that, “without additional information,” the inference that child pornography suspects are likely to store images in safe and secret places, such as their homes, “is not reasonable here.” He contends that “[w]arrant applications often include expertise of law enforcement officials about a particular type of crime and the customary practices of persons suspected of being engaged in such criminal activity” and here, the affidavit contained no such information. Certainly additional information regarding an affiant’s training and experience could be helpful in establishing probable cause. Here, however, neither the inference suggested by the defendant nor additional information regarding the affiant’s training and experience were required to establish probable cause. The magistrate was presented with information indicating that what appeared to be a computer printout of child pornography was observed in the defendant’s garage but no computer equipment had ever been seen in the garage and the defendant had only been seen using his computer in his home. When this information is viewed in a common-sense manner, we find that it was reasonable for the magistrate to infer that evidence of child pornography would be found on the defendant’s computer or in his home. Cf. State v. Kirsch, 139 N.H. 647, 651 (1995) (finding that “‘pedophile profile’ reciting the types of material collected by child molesters and their proclivity for retaining it” was not required to establish probable cause where a common-sense inference about the longevity of child pornography retained by the sexual abuser could “reasonably be drawn from the nature of the items themselves, such as the photographs taken of the children”).', 'The defendant also maintains that because he shared his home with his wife, “it was more likely that if [he] had additional child pornography he would have stored it somewhere other than in his home, such as in the garage.” Merely because the defendant could have stored additional child pornography in the garage rather than in the home does not defeat probable cause in this case. Our duty as the reviewing court “is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983) (quotation, brackets and ellipsis omitted). Here, we are convinced that this standard was met.', 'We are further not persuaded by the defendant’s argument that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search of his home and computer because Brown “did not describe the physical attributes of the paper [or provide other information] that would have tended to show that [it] originated from a computer rather than, for example, a photo printer or a copier.” While the affidavit did not completely refute the idea that the paper originated from somewhere other than a computer, we have never required “complete certainty . . . when determining whether probable cause to search exists.” State v. Daniel, 142 N.H. 54, 59 (1997) (quotation omitted). Similarly, we do not believe it is fatal to the warrant’s validity that the affidavit did not contain information indicating “that [the defendant] or his wife had a printer.” A common-sense inference that a printer would likely be found in the defendant’s home may be reasonably drawn from the fact that the affidavit contained information indicating both the defendant and his wife owned laptop computers, which they used in the home on a daily basis.', 'Finally, the defendant argues that “to the extent the trial court inferred, as the State suggested in its objection [to his motion to suppress], that the images found in the garage originated from the internet or that [he] made them using a digital camera, those inferences also lack foundation.” (Citation omitted.) It is not clear from a review of the trial court’s order, however, that it drew such an inference in rendering its decision. Moreover, we do not believe that this inference was necessary to establish probable cause for the search of the defendant’s home and his computer. As stated above, the affidavit contained information indicating that what appeared to be a computer printout of child pornography was observed in the defendant’s garage and the defendant had only been seen using his computer in his home. The magistrate could conclude that there was a substantial likelihood that the images originated from somewhere in the defendant’s home and thus, that evidence or contraband related to child pornography would be found there. We note that the defendant has not raised an argument on appeal concerning the breadth of the search warrant.', 'As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does our State Constitution under these circumstances, see Fish, 142 N.H. at 527-28; Gates, 462 U.S. at 238, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN and LYNN, JJ., concurred.

Delaney, attorney general (Stephen G. LaBonte, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'David M. Rothstein, deputy chief appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'CONBOY, J. After a jury trial, the defendant, Daniel Matton, was found guilty on two charges: assault by a prisoner as a class A felony and assault by a prisoner as a class B felony. See RSA 642:9, IV (Supp. 2012). On appeal, he argues that the Trial Court (Wageling, J.) erred when it refused to give: (1) a mutual combat instruction on the class B felony charge; and (2) a “special” jury instruction that the prior convictions of several of the State’s witnesses were relevant to their credibility. We affirm.', 'The jury could have found the following facts. At the time of the incident giving rise to the charges, Matton was incarcerated at the Strafford County House of Corrections. His cell mate was Michael Horrigan. On May 31, 2009, Horrigan was playing cards with two other inmates, Cullen and Chase, when Matton approached Horrigan and accused him of damaging his personal property. Horrigan and Matton argued as they proceeded back to their cell. The argument became louder. Matton punched Horrigan in the jaw. Horrigan fell, and hit his head against a steel table as he fell. Horrigan was subsequently transported to the Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, where he was diagnosed as suffering from a fractured jaw, a right temporal bone fracture, bilateral subdural hematomas and bleeding within the temporal horns of the brain and within the left frontal area of the brain.', 'The defendant was indicted on one count of assault by a prisoner, charged as a class A felony, and one count of assault by a prisoner, charged as a class B felony. Three of the witnesses who testified at trial for the State had been inmates at the Strafford County House of Corrections at the time of the assault. The trial court denied defense counsel’s requests for: (1) a mutual combat jury instruction; and (2) an instruction that advised the jury that the prior felony convictions of the inmate witnesses could be considered to assess their credibility. The jury found the defendant guilty on both charges and this appeal followed.', 'Whether to give a requested jury instruction, and the scope and wording of an instruction, is within the sound discretion of the trial court; we review its decision on these issues to determine whether it is sustainable. State v. Davidson, 163 N.H. 462, 472 (2012). The purpose of the trial court’s charge is to explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case. Id. When reviewing a charge, we evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them and in light of all the evidence in the case. Id. We determine whether the instructions adequately and accurately explained each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case. Id.', 'The defendant first argues that he was entitled to a mutual combat instruction. Although we have not been provided with a copy of the indictments, the record reflects that the State indicted the defendant on two charges. See RSA 642:9, IV. The first charge alleged that he caused serious bodily injury to the victim; the second alleged that he caused bodily injury to the victim. Given the defendant’s status as a prisoner, the offense is classified as a class A felony if the State proves that the defendant committed a “first degree or second degree assault as defined under RSA 631:1 or RSA 631:2.” RSA 642:9, IV. The offense is a class B felony if it is “simple assault as defined under RSA 631:2-a unless [it is] committed in a fight entered into by mutual consent, in which case it is a misdemeanor.” Id.', 'The defendant was entitled to the requested mutual combat jury instruction only if there was some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense. State v. Soto, 162 N.H. 708, 713 (2011). “Some evidence” means more than a minutia or scintilla of evidence. Id. We review the record in light of the defendant’s assertion that the evidence supports his requested jury instruction. Id. Absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion, we will affirm the denial of a requested jury instruction. Id.', 'The defendant argues that he presented sufficient evidence of a fight entered into by mutual consent. He cites evidence that the victim: (1) made a derogatory comment about the defendant’s girlfriend in front of other inmates; (2) agreed to follow the defendant back to an area near their cell; (3) faced the defendant; (4) “stood within an [arm’s] length of him”; and (5) “argued loudly back and forth with him.”', 'Even if we assume that the defendant presented sufficient evidence to support a mutual combat instruction on the class B felony charge, we conclude that he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the court’s failure to give the instruction. The trial court sentenced the defendant on only the class A felony. A mutual combat instruction is relevant only to the class B felony charge and the defendant did not receive a sentence for that offense. See State v. Lambert, 147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (to establish that trial court ruling is not sustainable, defendant must demonstrate that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case). In reaching this conclusion, we have considered and rejected the defendant’s argument that if we were to find error, he would be entitled to a retrial on the class B felony charge because if acquitted, he might receive a lesser sentence on his class A conviction. We note that the trial court stated at the sentencing hearing: “I, after some brief discussion with counsel, indicated that it was my sense . . . that one of these charges ends up being subsumed into the other, that is the Class B felony subsumed into the Class A felony. . . . [S]ince both injuries were the result of the same one hit and both parties agree to that, I feel that in terms of sentencing, I will not sentence him separately on each of these offenses. I believe that the double jeopardy provisions either federally or through the state’s analysis would restrict me from doing that.” Thus, the trial court apparently viewed the charged offenses as alternative charges. Having reviewed the record before us, including the trial court’s remarks at the sentencing hearing, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the trial court’s denial of a mutual combat instruction on the class B felony charge prejudiced his case, and therefore he has failed to establish an unsustainable exercise of the court’s discretion. See id.', 'The defendant also argues that the trial court erred “when it refused to give a special jury instruction that [the inmate] witnesses’ prior convictions were relevant to their credibility.” In considering this claim of error, we review the instructions in their entirety. See Davidson, 163 N.H. at 472.', 'At trial, the State presented testimony from three inmates, Cullen, Chase, and Lewis. Cullen testified about a prior conviction and that there were charges pending against him for burglary and drug possession at the time of the investigation in this case. He also admitted that he had asked for favorable treatment on the pending charges in exchange for his testimony. Chase and Lewis also testified about their prior convictions.', 'The defendant concedes that the witnesses were impeached with their convictions pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 609(a). He argues, however, that the trial court erred in failing to specifically instruct the jury that it could consider the witnesses’ prior convictions to assess their credibility. He contends that the court’s failure to give a general witness credibility instruction in its final charge required the requested specific instruction so that the jury would understand how to evaluate the witness conviction evidence.', 'Although the trial court did not give an instruction specific to the use of prior convictions to assess the credibility of the State’s witnesses, the court gave the following general credibility instructions at the beginning of the trial.', 'In deciding whether the State has proven the charge against', 'the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must consider the', 'credibility of the witnesses; that is, it’s up to you to decide whom to', 'believe.', 'If there’s any conflict between the witnesses, then you must', 'resolve the conflict and decide what the truth is. Simply because a', 'witness has taken an oath to tell the truth does not mean that you', 'have to accept the testimony as true. In deciding which witness to', 'believe, you should use your common sense and judgment.', 'I suggest you consider a number of factors: Whether the', 'witness appeared to be candid; whether the witness appeared', 'worthy of belief; the appearance and the demeanor of the witness', 'while testifying; whether the witness has an interest in the', 'outcome of the case; whether the witness has any reason for not', 'telling the truth; whether what the witness said seemed reasonable', 'or probable; whether what the witness said seemed unreasonable', 'or inconsistent with the other evidence in this case, or with that', 'witness’s prior statement; whether the witness had any friendship', 'or animosity towards other people in the case.', 'In deciding which witnesses to believe and how much of their', 'testimony to believe, you should consider both the direct and the', 'circumstantial – I’m sorry, the direct and the cross-examination of', 'the witness. You should consider these factors in deciding the', 'credibility of all witnesses, whether or not they happen to be', 'ordinary citizens or police officers.', 'In short, you should consider the testimony of each witness', 'and give it the weight you think it deserves. You can accept all of', 'what a witness has to say; you can reject all of what a witness has', 'to say; or you can accept some of it and you can reject some of it.', 'It’s entirely up to you.', 'At the close of trial, the trial court did not repeat these general instructions. It did, however, give the following instructions:', 'The testimony of some witnesses must be considered with', 'more caution than the testimony of other witnesses. You have', 'heard the testimony of an informant. An informant is someone who', 'provides information or evidence against someone else in return for', 'some consideration, such as an agreement by the State to reduce', 'or drop charges against the informant or otherwise provide the', 'informant with a more favorable disposition of the informant’s own', 'difficulties with law than would otherwise be the case.', 'Under the law, the State has the right to use informants as', 'witnesses. The testimony of such a person may be received in', 'evidence, considered by you and given such weight as you the', 'jurors feel it deserves. The testimony of an informant may be', 'enough for itself -- in itself for a conviction if you find that it', 'establishes the Defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'However, it is also true that the testimony of an informant must be', 'scrutinized by you with great care and caution in deciding what if', 'any weight it should be given. In particular, you must consider', 'whether the testimony of an informant has been affected by the', 'agreement the informant has struck with the State or by the', 'informant’s own self-interest in the outcome of the case or by', 'prejudice against the Defendant.', 'We have previously expressed our reluctance to establish a categorical rule requiring that specific instructions be given when informants testify. State v. Knight, 161 N.H. 338, 343 (2011). As we have long recognized, the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether a particular instruction should be given. Id.', 'Consistent with our established practice, we decline to adopt a rule that would require that a trial court instruct a jury that evidence of the convictions of a witness, other than the defendant, may be considered in assessing that witness’s credibility. Compare State v. Hebert, 158 N.H. 306, 313 (2009) (because evidence of prior conviction is inherently prejudicial to defendant, trial court must give limiting instruction when it admits such evidence for impeachment purposes pursuant to Rule 609(a) unless defendant expressly waives his right to such instruction on the record). Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of another purpose for which the convictions might be admitted. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, “One way of discrediting the witness is to introduce evidence of a prior criminal conviction of that witness. By so doing the cross-examiner intends to afford the jury a basis to infer that the witness’ character is such that he would be less likely than the average trustworthy citizen to be truthful in his testimony. The introduction of evidence of a prior crime is thus a general attack on the credibility of the witness.” Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316 (1974). Having reviewed in their entirety the instructions given by the trial court, we conclude that the court did not err when it declined to give a specific jury instruction that the witnesses’ prior convictions were relevant to their credibility. Although a trial court may give such a limiting instruction, it is not required when the witness is not the defendant.', 'Finally, we caution that although a trial court may provide preliminary jury instructions on witness credibility, along with other preliminary instructions, it should provide the jury with all necessary instructions, including witness credibility instructions, in its final oral charge. Because the trial court in this case, however, provided the jury with written copies of its preliminary instructions, which included instructions on witness credibility, we conclude that the trial court’s failure to include witness credibility instructions in its final charge does not warrant reversal.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.

On March 25, 2009, Heather Taylor was the target of a drug investigation conducted by the New Hampshire Police Narcotics Investigation Unit. The police suspected that Taylor was transporting large quantities of heroin and cocaine from Massachusetts into New Hampshire. The police planned a “controlled buy.” In a controlled buy, the police use a confidential informant (CI) to purchase drugs from a target using paper currency that has been documented by the recording of the bills’ serial numbers (also known as “buy money”). In a controlled buy, officers search the CI before and after sending him or her to purchase the drugs to ensure that the CI does not have unaccounted-for money or contraband. Officers also conduct surveillance of the CI and the target during the investigation.', 'The police planned for a female CI to purchase drugs from Taylor on March 25. The plan was for the CI to go to Taylor’s residence in Rochester, accompany her to Massachusetts, and then return with her to New Hampshire. At approximately 9:00 a.m., State Police Trooper Bryan Trask, Sergeant Ellen Arcieri, and a detective from the Rochester Police Department met with the CI. They searched the CI and her belongings and vehicle, and found no money or contraband. Trask then supplied the CI with $300 in documented bills (the buy money).', 'At 11:40 a.m., the CI drove to Taylor’s residence in Rochester, and police officers followed. Officers observed the CI enter the residence, where she remained for between sixty and ninety minutes. While the CI was inside the residence, however, the target of the investigation changed from Taylor to the defendant. The CI and Taylor left Taylor’s residence and drove together to a residence in North Hampton that the defendant shared with Kenneth Vaillancourt. Surveillance units followed.', 'At approximately 2:00 p.m., the CI and Taylor arrived at the North Hampton house. Vaillancourt was at work. Approximately forty-five minutes after entering the house, the CI exited alone, got into her car, and drove directly to a prearranged meeting place. There, she gave Trask a small plastic baggie containing cocaine. After receiving the cocaine, officers searched the CI, her vehicle, and her belongings for other contraband, and again found none. She no longer had the buy money.', 'Thereafter, the defendant and Taylor emerged from the residence and drove away in a gray BMW. The defendant was driving and Taylor was sitting in the front passenger’s seat. Officers then conducted a motor vehicle stop, took the defendant and Taylor into custody, and transported them to the police station. Trask applied for warrants to search the defendant, Taylor, and the BMW.', 'Before the warrants were issued, Taylor identified certain items in the BMW belonging to her, including a green and purple backpack on the front passenger’s side floor, a purse on the front passenger’s seat, and a black backpack in the trunk. She consented to a search of those items as well as her person. Officers found nothing of significance in the backpacks, but in the purse they found crack cocaine pipes, brass knuckles, lighters, scissors, a syringe, a first aid kit, and a digital scale. There was testimony at trial that the buy money was found on the defendant’s person.', 'Upon executing a search warrant for the BMW, officers found a black bag under the rear passenger’s seat. The bag’s contents – including laptop computers with content linked to the defendant, mail addressed to the defendant, and a notebook entitled “Matthew Tabaldi’s usernames and passcodes” – indicated that the bag belonged to the defendant. Other items in the bag included: a ledger, plastic baggies, a white powder used as a cutting agent to dilute the strength of drugs, a weight for calibrating a scale, and a small torch commonly used for quickly heating drugs. The bag also contained a device police referred to as a “taser.” Additionally, officers discovered a black case under the driver’s seat, which contained drug paraphernalia, including spoons, plastic tubing, copper mesh, and a hypodermic needle. Officers also discovered a digital scale in the pocket of a canvas guitar bag behind the driver’s seat, crack cocaine pipes in a black canvas bag on the front passenger’s seat, and another crack cocaine pipe in the pocket of a jacket on that seat. Finally, a Newport cigarette box containing crack cocaine was found between the driver’s seat and the center console.', 'Officers also executed a search warrant at Vaillancourt’s residence. In the defendant’s bedroom they found, among other things, an open box of plastic sandwich bags and a white powdered substance that later tested positive for cocaine. On August 20, 2009, the defendant met with Trask and Arcieri at the State Police barracks in Epping, and told them that he dealt drugs. During a recorded telephone call with Taylor on October 2, 2011, the defendant discussed the events of March 25 with her saying, “I had to wait for a girl and make a sale.” Taylor responded, “Don’t be hating. Don’t be hating.” The defendant responded, “Hating? I’m doing a long time for this.” II. Discussion', 'A. Motion to Strike Juror', 'During jury selection, the venire was advised that the defendant was a convicted felon. A prospective juror, H.S., thereafter explained to the trial court, “[H]earing that a gentleman in the defendant’s chair is a convicted felon just makes me a little – somewhat concerned for the charges brought against him.” When asked if she would be able to put her concern aside, the juror indicated, “I will do my best.” The trial court then engaged in the following exchange with H.S.:', 'Court: And you’re going to hear about this, but you’re going to', 'need to expressly and affirmatively be able to say to me that’s --', 'I’m not trying this case on the basis of someone’s reputation or his', 'past.', 'H.S.: Yes, sir.', 'Court: Whether or not the State has proven the case here, beyond', 'a reasonable doubt.', 'H.S.: Okay.', 'Court: So you need to be focused in on the evidence here.', 'H.S.: Yes, sir. Okay.', 'Court: You can do that?', 'H.S.: Yes, sir. Defense counsel moved to strike H.S. for cause on the basis of her “reservations.” The trial court denied the motion. H.S. was later stricken following the parties’ use of their peremptory challenges. See RSA 606:3, III (2001); see also RSA 606:4, III (2001).', 'The defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike H.S. for cause, and that the error violated his rights to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Articles 15, 17, 21, and 35 of the New Hampshire Constitution. We first address the defendant’s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).', 'Part I, Article 35 of the State Constitution provides, “It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will admit.” “This provision for judicial impartiality is applicable as well to jurors.” State v. Town, 163 N.H. 790, 793 (2012). “[I]t is a fundamental precept of our system of justice that a defendant has the right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury.” Id. at 793-94 (quotation omitted).', '“Generally, a juror is presumed to be impartial.” Id. at 794. “A juror is considered impartial if the juror can lay aside her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.” Id. (quotation omitted). “When a juror’s impartiality is questioned, however, the trial court has a duty to determine whether the juror is indifferent.” Id. “If it appears that any juror is not indifferent, he shall be set aside on that trial.” RSA 500-A:12, II (2010); Town, 163 N.H. at 794. “Indifference or impartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind.” State v. Weir, 138 N.H. 671, 673 (1994) (quotation omitted). The trial court’s determination of the impartiality of the jurors selected is essentially a question of demeanor and credibility and, thus, is entitled to special deference. Id. at 673-74. “We will not disturb the trial court’s ruling absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion or a finding that the trial judge’s decision was against the weight of the evidence.” Town, 163 N.H. at 794.', 'In Town, we considered an argument similar to that presented here. The defendant in Town was accused of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Id. at 791. A potential juror expressed concerns regarding her ability to be impartial. Id. at 794. The juror revealed that she had been the victim of sexual assault and also stated, “I think I need to do this.” Id. (quotation omitted). She then reiterated that she was “not sure” whether she could be fair and impartial. Id. (quotation omitted). Although the trial court twice asked her if she could put aside her personal circumstances and judge the case based solely upon the evidence presented, each time she merely indicated that she would “try.” Id. (quotation omitted). We reversed the defendant’s conviction, concluding that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in finding that the juror was qualified to sit on the jury. Id. at 791, 795. We held that the juror’s “indication that she would ‘try’ to be fair and impartial, without more, was insufficient to establish that she could lay aside her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.” Id. at 794 (quotation omitted).', 'This case is similar to Town in that H.S. initially stated that she would “do her best” to put aside her concerns regarding the defendant’s status as a convicted felon. Here, however, the trial court probed further, asking a number of questions, including whether H.S. would “affirmatively be able to say” that she would “not try[ ] this case on the basis of someone’s reputation or his past.” H.S. responded, “Yes, sir.” On this record, we conclude that the trial court satisfied its duty to determine whether H.S. was impartial and that the juror’s responses supported the trial court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to strike H.S. for cause. Having concluded that the trial court did not err when it determined that H.S. was impartial, we need not address the defendant’s arguments based upon his assumption that the juror was not impartial. Because the State Constitution provides at least as much protection as the Federal Constitution on this issue, we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution. See Weir, 138 N.H. at 673.', 'B. Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'The defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motions to dismiss for insufficient evidence the felon in possession of an electronic defense weapon and possession of crack cocaine charges. “To prevail upon a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Trebian, 164 N.H. 629, 632 (2013). “When the evidence is solely circumstantial, it must exclude all rational conclusions except guilt.” Id. “Under this standard, however, we still consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and examine each evidentiary item in context, not in isolation.” Id. “The proper analysis is not whether every possible conclusion consistent with innocence has been excluded, but, rather, whether all such rational conclusions based upon the evidence have been excluded.” Id. We review the entire trial record because the defendant chose to present evidence after the trial court denied his motions to dismiss. See State v. Dion, 164 N.H. 544, 548 (2013). Even though a defendant is not required to present a case, if he chooses to do so, he takes the chance that evidence presented in his case may assist in proving the State’s case. Id.', '1. Felon in Possession', 'To convict a defendant of being a felon in possession of an electronic defense weapon, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that: (1) the defendant was a convicted felon; and (2) he possessed “an electronic defense weapon away from the premises where he resides.” RSA 159:21. RSA 159:20, I (2002) defines an electronic defense weapon as “an electronically activated non-lethal device which is designed for or capable of producing an electrical charge of sufficient magnitude to immobilize or incapacitate a person temporarily.”', 'The defendant stipulated at trial that he was a convicted felon. He contends that the evidence was insufficient because the State failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the device found in his possession was “designed for or capable of producing an electrical charge of sufficient magnitude to immobilize or incapacitate a person temporarily.” We agree.', 'The only evidence at trial regarding the capability of the device was Trask’s testimony. Over the defendant’s objection, Trask testified that, while searching the defendant’s black bag, he found a device that he described as a taser. He then testified:', 'Q And that, just so we’re clear, . . . you yourself carry a Taser,', 'I imagine?', 'A Yes.', 'Q As part of your work?', 'A Yes.', 'Q Okay. That obvious – what’s in front of us here . . .', 'obviously differs from the weapon you carry.', 'A Correct.', 'Q Okay. But when you characterized it as a Taser, did you', 'take a look at it [at] all on the day you discovered it – on the day', 'you found it back on March 25th of 2009.', 'A I did. I actually activated it.', 'Q What happened when you activated it?', 'A When I activated it, there were blue sparks that arched', 'between the two electrodes . . . . Depending on [how] you use it,', 'there would be electricity that would flow from one side to the', 'other side.', 'Q And you could see that?', 'A I could see that.', 'Q Okay.', 'A And you could hear the crackling of the electricity going', 'back and forth.', 'Q Okay. And how does it appear to be powered?', 'A By a nine-volt battery.', 'Q Okay. And this was obviously some time ago that this was', 'discovered. As far as you’re aware, is the battery still working or is', 'it out?', 'A No, it’s dead at this point. The State presented no other evidence to prove the charge.', 'This testimony was insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish that the taser Trask discovered was designed for, or capable of, producing the requisite electrical charge. Trask’s testimony that the device was a “taser” from which he observed “sparks” and could hear “the crackling of electricity,” even when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was insufficient to allow a rational juror to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the device was designed for or capable of the requisite electrical charge. Cf. People v. Racy, 56 Cal. Rptr. 3d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2007) (“[T]he effects of a stun gun, unlike the effects of more typically used weapons such as knives or handguns, are matters beyond the experience of average jurors.”).', 'Because the evidence was insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, one of the elements of the charge of felon in possession of an electrical defense weapon, we reverse, with prejudice, the defendant’s conviction on that charge. See Gordon, 161 N.H. at 418.', '2. Possession of Crack Cocaine', 'The possession of crack cocaine charge alleged that the defendant knowingly “had in his possession, or under his control, . . . a quantity of the narcotic drug crack cocaine.” To gain a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant: (1) had knowledge of the nature of the drug; (2) had knowledge of its presence in his vicinity; and (3) had custody of the drug and exercised dominion and control over it. State v. Smalley, 148 N.H. 66, 68 (2002). The defendant challenges only the State’s proof that he had custody of the crack cocaine.', 'When a drug is not found in a defendant’s physical possession, the State must prove constructive possession. Id. “Constructive possession can be inferred from incriminating statements or circumstances linking the defendant to the drugs, such as personal possessions found near the drugs.” Id. at 69 (quotation omitted). “[C]onstructive possession of drugs need not be exclusive.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he constructively possessed the crack cocaine. Specifically, he argues that “the evidence could have just as likely supported the conclusion that the cigarette box, and thus the crack cocaine, belonged to Taylor.” Thus, he contends, the evidence was insufficient because it failed to exclude all rational conclusions except guilt. See Trebian, 164 N.H. at 632.', 'Although the defendant also intimates that the evidence could also have supported a conclusion that the cigarette box belonged to Vaillancourt, he does not develop this argument. Nor does the record establish that he raised this argument in the trial court. Accordingly, we do not consider it.', 'We conclude that a rational juror, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant constructively possessed the crack cocaine. The crack cocaine was found in a location over which the defendant could exercise dominion and control. He was the driver of the vehicle; the cigarette box was found between the driver’s seat and the center console. Additionally, several of his possessions were located near the crack cocaine, including his black bag containing drug paraphernalia. “[P]ersonal possessions of the defendant [found] in close proximity to the controlled substance may provide a sufficiently close nexus between the defendant and the substance to allow the jury to infer possession.” Smalley, 148 N.H. at 69 (quotation omitted).', 'Although the defendant argues that the crack cocaine could have belonged to Taylor, “the jury could have drawn reasonable inferences based upon the evidence presented and concluded that [it] belonged to the defendant.” State v. Duran, 162 N.H. 369, 373 (2011); see United States v. Howard, 687 F.3d 13, 20–21 (1st Cir. 2012) (it was within jury’s prerogative to choose which inference regarding constructive possession was most worthy of belief). The State did not have to establish that the defendant had exclusive constructive possession of the crack cocaine. See Smalley, 148 N.H. at 69.', 'Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational juror could have reasonably found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant constructively possessed the crack cocaine. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of the possession of crack cocaine charge.', 'C. Evidentiary Issues', '1. Buy Money', 'The defendant challenges on both evidentiary and State and Federal Confrontation Clause grounds the admission of Trask’s testimony that the buy money was found on the defendant’s person. See N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amends. VI, XIV. He argues that the evidence was inadmissible hearsay, see N.H. R. Ev. 801, and that its admission violated his rights to confront witnesses against him guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions.', 'We first address the defendant’s arguments under the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence. See State v. Hodgkiss, 132 N.H. 376, 379 (1989) (We follow strong policy not to address constitutional arguments unless required.). “We accord the trial court considerable deference in determining the admissibility of evidence, and we will not disturb its decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.” State v. Munroe, 161 N.H. 618, 626 (2011). “To demonstrate an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must show that the trial court’s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.” Id.', 'The defendant challenges the following testimony by Trask:', 'Q And in particular, did you come in to contact with money that', 'you understood to have been taken off the Defendant’s person', 'following that stop?', 'A Yes, I did.', 'Q Okay. And how much currency was that?', 'A It was $582 at the time on his person.', 'Q Was any portion of that currency the same money that had', 'been given to the CI?', 'A Yes, it was. The 300 that I had serialized were -- was located', '[on] him. It was part of that five hundred –', '....', 'Q So of that . . . 582, 300 of it was the money that you had given', 'to the CI and had recorded the serial numbers?', 'A Yes.', '....', 'Q So you didn’t take any property from [the defendant] yourself?', 'A I did not.', 'Q You testified yesterday that you were given money that was', 'taken from [the defendant]?', 'A Yes.', 'Q Okay. So that means somebody told you that they did that?', 'A Correct. The defendant contends that this testimony constitutes hearsay. We agree. Hearsay is “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” N.H. R. Ev. 801. A statement that is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is not hearsay. See id.; see also State v. Pelletier, 149 N.H. 243, 253 (2003). “Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by [the rules of evidence] or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.” N.H. R. Ev. 802.', 'Trask’s testimony that he “understood” that the buy money had been taken from the defendant constitutes inadmissible hearsay. His testimony introduced, indirectly, an out-of-court statement by another declarant that the buy money was found on the defendant’s person. This out-of-court statement was introduced for the truth of what it asserted – that, in fact, the buy money was found on the defendant’s person. “If the purpose of testimony is to use an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of facts stated, the hearsay objection cannot be eliminated by eliciting the content of the statement in an indirect form.” 2 McCormick on Evidence § 249, at 196 (Kenneth S. Broun ed., 7th ed. 2013). “Thus, when offered as proof of the facts asserted, testimony regarding ‘information received’ by the witness and the results of investigations made by other persons are properly classified as hearsay.” Id. at 196-97; see United States v. Baker, 432 F.3d 1189, 1209 (11th Cir. 2005) (investigator’s statement about what he learned upon arriving at shooting scene was inadmissible hearsay); United States v. Hernandez, 750 F.2d 1256, 1257 (5th Cir. 1985) (testimony that Federal Drug Enforcement Administration was made aware that defendant was a drug smuggler constituted inadmissible hearsay); Ikemire v. State, 852 N.E.2d 640, 644 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006) (asking police officer to testify about what he “learned” after questioning a witness elicited a hearsay response). Accordingly, although Trask’s testimony introduced the out-of-court statement indirectly, it, nonetheless, constitutes inadmissible hearsay.', 'Trask’s testimony that someone told him that the buy money was found on the defendant is also inadmissible hearsay. The statement was made by someone other than Trask (the testifying declarant) and was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the buy money was found on the defendant).', 'The State’s arguments for a contrary conclusion are unpersuasive. The State first asserts that Trask’s testimony was admitted for “the limited purpose of explaining why Trask had compared the serial numbers on the bills.” This is not supported by the record. Trask never testified that he compared the serial numbers on the bills. He testified only that the money taken from the defendant included the buy money. He never testified about how he determined this to be the case.', 'Moreover, the trial court stated that it allowed the testimony to show “the procedure that [Trask] worked on,” which included “where the money came from.” The trial court expressly allowed Trask to testify that someone had “represented to him” that the buy money came from the defendant. Thus, the “procedure” about which the trial court allowed Trask to testify included the hearsay statement, admitted for the truth of what it asserted.', 'Alternatively, the State contends that because the defendant “refused” the trial court’s offer to give a limiting instruction, “he cannot claim that he was prejudiced by the court’s failure to do so.” Because the “procedure” about which the court allowed Trask to testify included the fact that Trask was told that the buy money was found on the defendant, this is one of those rare cases in which a curative instruction, even if it had been given, would not have cured the prejudice. See State v. LaBranche, 118 N.H. 176, 179-80 (1978).', 'The State next invokes the invited error doctrine. Under that doctrine, “a party may not avail himself of error into which he has led the trial court.” State v. Bain, 145 N.H. 367, 370 (2000) (quotation omitted). The State contends that on direct examination, Trask merely testified that he “understood” that the buy money had been found on the defendant. It was not until cross-examination that Trask testified that someone told him that this was the case. The State asserts that “because it was the defendant who elicited the testimony that the money had in fact been taken from him, he cannot now claim that he was prejudiced by that testimony.” The State’s effort to distinguish Trask’s testimony on direct examination from his testimony on cross-examination is unavailing. As discussed previously, Trask’s testimony on both direct and cross-examination constitutes inadmissible hearsay. Trask’s testimony on both direct and cross-examination referred to the same out-of-court statement by another declarant.', 'The State argues that even if Trask’s testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay, the error was harmless because there was overwhelming alternative evidence that the defendant sold the cocaine to the CI. We agree.', '“An error is harmless if we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict.” State v. Beede, 156 N.H. 102, 109 (2007). “The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless.” Id. “The evaluation of whether the State has met its burden involves consideration of the alternative evidence presented at trial and the character of the contested evidence.” Id. “An error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight, and if the contested evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State’s evidence of guilt.” Id.', 'We conclude that the State has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant’s conviction for selling cocaine was not affected by admission of Trask’s testimony that the buy money was found on the defendant’s person. The sale of narcotic drug (cocaine) charge alleged that the defendant knowingly “sold a quantity of the narcotic drug Cocaine . . . to a cooperating individual working with the New Hampshire State Police.” Accordingly, for the jury to convict the defendant of this charge, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knowingly sold cocaine to the CI.', 'The alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt on this charge was multi-faceted. Substantial evidence linked him to the controlled buy, which occurred at Vaillancourt’s residence, where the defendant lived. Moreover, the defendant admitted to Taylor that, on March 25, 2009, the day on which the controlled buy occurred, he “had to wait for a girl and make a sale.” From this statement, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the “girl” to whom he referred was the CI and that the “sale” he made on March 25 was the sale of cocaine to the CI. He also told Taylor that he would be “doing a long time for this.” The two statements in context allowed the jury reasonably to infer that the defendant would be “doing a long time” for selling cocaine to the CI.', 'Additionally, there was substantial evidence that the defendant regularly sold drugs. The defendant admitted to the police that he was involved in drug dealing. Further, when the police searched the defendant’s bedroom, the police found an open box of plastic sandwich bags that “were indicative of packaging drugs for distribution.” They also found a white powdered substance on the defendant’s desk, which tested positive for cocaine. Moreover, a bag found in the BMW with items indicating that the bag belonged to the defendant also contained a ledger, plastic sandwich bags, a small bag containing a cutting agent, and a weight for calibrating a scale.', 'We conclude that, given the extent and nature of the alternative evidence of the defendant’s guilt on this charge, such evidence was overwhelming and that the inadmissible testimony was inconsequential to it. Accordingly, we hold that any error in admitting the challenged testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the defendant contends that admitting Trask’s testimony violated his rights under the State and Federal Confrontation Clauses, our conclusion that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is dispositive of those claims. See State v. Hernandez, 159 N.H. 394, 401-02 (2009) (applying harmless error review to admission of evidence in violation of State and Federal Confrontation Clauses).', '2. Photographs', 'The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred when it admitted two photographs that he asserts unfairly prejudiced the jury. One photograph was of the defendant, leaning back in a car seat and holding fanned-out paper currency in his hand. The second is a photograph that the police took of the first photograph tucked into the frame of a mirror, surrounded by photographs of the defendant’s son. The defendant concedes that the second photograph was taken to document the location of the first photograph.', 'The defendant contends that both photographs were irrelevant. See N.H. R. Ev. 401, 402. He also argues that even if the photographs were marginally relevant, they were inadmissible under New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b) because their limited probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.', '“We review challenges to a trial court’s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party’s case.” State v. Brooks, 164 N.H. 272, 283 (2012) (quotation omitted). In determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary decision made. State v. Noucas, 165 N.H. ___, ___ (decided July 16, 2013). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court’s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. Id.', 'Under Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” N.H. R. Ev. 401. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. N.H. R. Ev. 402.', 'Here, we conclude that the trial court reasonably determined that the challenged photographs were relevant to demonstrate that the defendant had dominion and control over the room in which the police found the cocaine and incriminating items. Proof of this fact was necessary to prove the possession of cocaine charge. See Trebian, 164 N.H. at 632. The charge alleged that the defendant knowingly “had in his possession, or under his control . . . a quantity of the narcotic drug cocaine.” The cocaine at issue was found in the bedroom.', 'To establish that the defendant constructively possessed the cocaine, the State had to prove more than that he and Vaillancourt shared occupancy of Vaillancourt’s home. See State v. Cartier, 133 N.H. 217, 221 (1990); State v. Comeau, 114 N.H. 431, 435 (1974) (evidence sufficient to establish constructive possession of drugs when evidence showed, among other things, that defendant had access to room where marijuana plants were found and kept personal possessions there). Although the defendant contends that the fact that he occupied the bedroom “was not . . . genuinely disputed,” because he did not stipulate that he knew the cocaine was in his room and that he had custody of and exercised dominion and control over it, the State retained the burden of proving these facts beyond a reasonable doubt. See Trebian, 164 N.H. at 632.', 'Under the balancing test common to Rules 403 and 404(b), we examine whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. State v. Marti, 140 N.H. 692, 694 (1996). “Under both rules, evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury’s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.” Id. (quotation omitted). “Unfair prejudice is not, of course, mere detriment to a defendant from the tendency of the evidence to prove guilt, in which sense all evidence offered by the prosecution is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Nightingale, 160 N.H. 569, 574 (2010). “Rather, the prejudice required to predicate reversible error is an undue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis, commonly one that is emotionally charged.” Id. Among the factors we consider in weighing the evidence are: (1) whether the evidence would have a great emotional impact upon a jury; (2) its potential for appealing to a juror’s sense of resentment or outrage; and (3) the extent to which the issue upon which it is offered is established by other evidence, stipulation or inference. Id. at 574-75.', '“The trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial impact of particular testimony, and what steps, if any, are necessary to remedy that prejudice.” Id. at 575 (quotation omitted). “Thus, we give the trial court broad latitude when ruling on the admissibility of potentially unfairly prejudicial evidence.” Id.', 'The trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the photographs was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. In the context of this case, we cannot say that a photograph of the defendant holding fanned-out paper currency in his hand was likely to have any greater emotional impact on the jury than the other evidence tending to show that he regularly sold drugs. See id. Although the photograph “may have been prejudicial, we cannot conclude that [it] was so inflammatory as to substantially outweigh its probative value.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'The defendant contends that the juxtaposition of the images in the police photograph, which showed the photograph of the defendant holding the money and two photographs of his son, “served to elicit a sense of sympathy for the child . . . , and to provoke the jury’s instinct to punish [the defendant] in an effort to protect the child.” We find this speculative, conclusory argument unpersuasive.', 'For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it admitted the photographs into evidence.', 'Affirmed in part; and reversed', 'in part.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.

SMITH', 'Argued: November 13, 2013', 'Opinion Issued: January 28, 2014', 'Joseph A. Foster, attorney general (Nicholas Cort, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Stephanie Hausman, senior assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'DALIANIS, C.J. The defendant, John A. Smith, appeals the sentence imposed by the Superior Court (Fitzgerald, J.) following his conviction by a jury of receipt of stolen property. See RSA 637:7, :11, I(b) (2007). The sole issue for our review is whether the trial court committed plain error by imposing a felony-level sentence, see RSA 637:11, I(b), instead of a misdemeanor-level sentence, see RSA 637:11, III (2007), when the jury was not instructed that it had to find that the stolen property consisted of firearms. See RSA 637:11, I(b). We affirm.', 'The jury could have found the following facts. In the summer of 2010, the victim invited a man and a woman into his home for a drink and showed them two handguns that he owned: a Smith & Wesson .44 caliber handgun and a SIG Sauer .380 caliber handgun. The three continued to drink, and eventually, the victim lost consciousness. When he awoke the next morning, he noticed the two handguns were missing, and he reported them stolen.', 'In August 2010, Eric Underwood telephoned the defendant and asked if he was interested in buying any weapons. The defendant told Underwood to “bring them over.” Underwood retrieved the two stolen handguns from another man and drove to the defendant’s residence where the defendant gave Underwood $400 for the two guns.', 'Sometime thereafter, the defendant asked a friend if he was interested in purchasing the two guns for $200 each. The friend immediately telephoned the Keene Police Department, offering to act as a confidential informant in this case. The police, together with the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Drug Task Force, arranged for the defendant’s friend to purchase the guns from the defendant while the friend wore a recording device.', 'The “buy” occurred on August 17, 2010. Before the friend met with the defendant, the police searched the friend and gave him $400. See State v. Tabaldi, 165 N.H. 306, 309-10 (2013) (describing “controlled buys” in general). The police accompanied the friend to the defendant’s home. The friend entered the home, spoke briefly with the defendant, gave him $400, and returned to the police with the two handguns. He was searched again after giving the guns to the police and was not found to have any contraband. An officer immediately checked the serial numbers on the guns and confirmed that they were the victim’s stolen guns. At trial, the victim identified the guns as his stolen guns.', 'At the beginning of the trial, the jury was read the indictment on which the defendant had been arraigned:', 'John Smith . . . is charged with the crime of receiving stolen', 'property contrary to RSA 637:7 and 637:11 on or about the 17th', 'day of August, 2010 . . . in that [he] did receive, retain, or dispose', 'of the .380 caliber handgun and/or a .44 caliber handgun,', 'knowing that the handgun or handguns had been stolen, or', 'believing that the handgun or handguns had probably been stolen,', 'with the purpose to deprive the owner of that handgun or those', 'handguns by selling one or both handguns to J.M., contrary to the', 'form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against', 'the peace and dignity of the State. Throughout the trial, witnesses, including the defendant, referred to the handguns as “firearms.” At the trial’s conclusion, the jury was instructed that, to convict the defendant, it had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that: (1) he “received, retained, and/or disposed of property”; (2) “the property belonged to another person”; (3) he “knew the property had been stolen or believed that . . . it had probably been stolen”; and (4) he “received the property with the purpose to deprive the owner of the property.” The defendant did not object to those instructions. After the jury convicted the defendant, the trial court sentenced him to the New Hampshire State Prison for a minimum of three years and a maximum of six years, stand committed. The defendant did not object to the sentence.', 'On appeal, however, the defendant argues that his sentence violates Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution because, for him to receive a felony-level sentence, the jury must have been instructed to find, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the stolen property consisted of firearms. See RSA 637:11, I(b) (receipt of stolen property constitutes a class A felony when “[t]he property stolen is a firearm”). Because the defendant did not make that argument in the trial court, he invokes the plain error rule, which allows us, under certain narrowly drawn circumstances, to correct errors not raised in the trial court. See Sup. Ct. R. 16-A.', 'For us to find plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. State v. Charest, 164 N.H. 252, 254 (2012). If all three conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to correct a forfeited error only if the error meets a fourth criterion: the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Id. The rule is used sparingly, however, and is limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. Id. We assume, without deciding, that the first three prongs of the plain error test are met. See State v. Russell, 159 N.H. 475, 490-94 (2009). We, therefore, confine our review to the fourth prong of the plain error test.', 'We find Russell instructive. The defendant in Russell, 159 N.H. at 490, was sentenced under RSA 651:2, II-g (Supp. 2013), which provides for an enhanced sentence “[i]f a person is convicted of a felony, an element of which is the possession, use or attempted use of a deadly weapon, and the deadly weapon is a firearm.” The trial court had instructed the jury that to convict the defendant of armed robbery, it had to find that he was armed with a “deadly weapon.” Id. (quotation omitted). However, the court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the “deadly weapon” with which the defendant was armed was a firearm. Id. Instead, the trial court defined a “deadly weapon” as “any firearm, knife or anything else which is used in such a way that the defendant knew or should have known that it could result in death or serious bodily injury.” Id. (quotation omitted). At trial, there was evidence that the “deadly weapon” used could have been a BB gun. Id. at 492. The defendant argued that, based upon the jury instructions and evidence presented at trial, the jury could have convicted him of armed robbery with a BB gun. Id. at 489. Accordingly, he contended that because the trial court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the “deadly weapon” he used in the armed robbery was a firearm, his sentence under RSA 651:2, II-g was unconstitutional. Id.', 'Because the defendant in Russell failed to object to the jury instructions and to his sentence, we reviewed his sentence under the plain error rule. Id. at 489. Although we agreed with the State’s concession that the trial court erred and that the error was plain, id. at 490, we concluded that the fourth prong of the plain error test was not met because evidence that the defendant used a firearm was overwhelming and undisputed, id. at 491-93. We explained that although a witness testified “that he initially thought that the shooter had a BB gun . . . , he also testified that the defendant pointed a gun at [the victim].” Id. at 492. The witness stated that the gun looked like a revolver and that a BB gun would not have done as much damage to the window of the car in which the victim was seated. Id. Moreover, the victim testified that someone “had stuck a gun inside [the] vehicle and shot out its back window.” Id. A crime scene technician testified that he found a metal fragment in the vehicle’s dashboard and that the fragment appeared to be a bullet. Id. A firearms expert confirmed that the fragment “was from a discharged bullet.” Id. (quotation omitted). In addition, at trial, the defendant in Russell did not dispute that the deadly weapon used during the robbery was a firearm. Id. “Given the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence that the defendant used a firearm to commit the armed robbery,” we declined to exercise our discretion to reverse the defendant’s conviction and sentence under the fourth prong of the plain error test. Id.', 'Similarly, here, evidence that the stolen property at issue consisted of handguns was overwhelming. The evidence at trial concerned only handguns as stolen property; no other allegedly stolen property was discussed. Additionally, the defendant did not dispute at trial, and does not dispute on appeal, that a handgun is a firearm. See id. At trial, witnesses, including the defendant, referred to the stolen handguns as “firearms.” In this case, as in others involving the issue of whether a handgun is a “firearm,” based upon the evidence at trial, “there was no real issue as to whether the handgun was a firearm.” State v. Taylor, 136 N.H. 131, 134 (1992); see State v. St. John, 129 N.H. 1, 3-4 (1986) (when defendant was charged with possessing a .357 Dan Wesson handgun and witnesses referred to the handgun as a “firearm” at trial, there was no need for trial court to instruct jury that a firearm is “a weapon from which shot is discharged by gunpowder” (quotation omitted)). Accordingly, as in Russell, we will not exercise our discretion under the fourth prong of the plain error rule to reverse the defendant’s conviction and sentence. See Russell, 159 N.H. at 492. Given the essentially uncontroverted evidence that the stolen property consisted of handguns and that the handguns constitute firearms, “the real threat then to the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings would be if the defendant, despite th[at] . . . uncontroverted evidence . . . , were not to receive the enhanced sentence.” Id. (quotation and brackets omitted).', 'In Russell, we also declined to hold “that the failure to instruct the jury on an element of the offense always constitutes plain error,” explaining that to do so “would create a windfall for criminal defendants,” giving them “every incentive not to object” at trial to jury instructions. Id. at 494. The defendant asks us to overrule that part of Russell. He asks that we hold “that, where the jury has not been instructed to find a sentencing enhancement element, sentencing based on that enhancement is plain error, satisfying all four elements of the plain error test.”', 'Generally, we will overrule a prior decision only after considering:', '(1) whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply by defying', 'practical workability; (2) whether the rule is subject to a kind of', 'reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequence of', 'overruling; (3) whether related principles of law have so far', 'developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of', 'abandoned doctrine; and (4) whether facts have so changed, or', 'come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of', 'significant application or justification. Maplevale Builders v. Town of Danville, 165 N.H. 99, 105 (2013) (quotation omitted). The defendant argues only that Russell is “intolerable,” but not because it “def[ies] practical workability.” Id. (quotations omitted). The defendant asserts that Russell is intolerable because: (1) it treats defendants who have preserved their objections to jury instructions and sentencing differently from those who have not; (2) it conflicts with prior and subsequent cases; and (3) it undermines “significant constitutional guarantees.” In effect, the defendant finds Russell to be intolerable because he believes that it was incorrectly decided. However, “[p]rincipled application of stare decisis requires a court to adhere . . . to . . . precedent in the absence of some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.” Id. (quotation omitted). Having failed to brief the four stare decisis factors, the defendant has not persuaded us that Russell must be overruled. See id.', 'Affirmed.', 'HICKS, CONBOY and BASSETT, JJ., concurred; LYNN, J., concurred specially.', 'LYNN, J., concurring specially. Because my view as to the factors that may warrant overruling precedent is broader than that of the majority, see State v. Quintero, 162 N.H. 526, 543-47 (2011) (Lynn, J., concurring specially), I arguably would be more willing than the majority to overrule State v. Russell, 159 N.H. 475 (2009), if I thought that case had been wrongly decided. But I do not believe Russell was wrongly decided; and insofar as the defendant argues that Russell is fundamentally at odds with our decision in State v. Kousounadis, 159 N.H. 413 (2009), I tend to believe that it is Kousounadis, not Russell, that is ripe for reexamination. See Kousounadis, 159 N.H. at 429-34 (Dalianis, J., joined by Hicks, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). ']"
