Samdperil on the brief), for the defendant.", "GALWAY, J. The defendant, Peter Munoz, appeals his conviction following a jury trial for attempted burglary, see RSA 635:1 (2007); RSA 629:1 (2007), arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motions to quash and to dismiss, and in permitting certain testimony. We affirm.", "The record discloses the following facts. On May 29, 2003, Jennifer Durbin was alone in her second-floor apartment at the Fairways apartment complex in Derry when she heard a noise from her living room. When she went to investigate, she saw a man standing on her balcony attempting to pry open her sliding-glass door with an orange-handled screwdriver. When the man noticed her, he pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his head, jumped off the balcony and departed. Durbin called the police. Upon their arrival, the police obtained a description of the man, and a latent fingerprint from the exterior handle of the balcony door.", "Later that morning, an anonymous female caller with a Hispanic accent telephoned the Derry Police Department and spoke with Officer Barry Charewicz. She informed him that she had the name of someone the police \u201cshould be looking at for the Fairways attempted burglary.\u201d Despite being asked, the caller would not give her name, but did provide the defendant\u2019s name, age and physical description. The caller also stated that she and the defendant knew each other because they were from the same country. Shortly before trial, the caller was identified as the defendant\u2019s wife, Naomi Pena.", "Based upon the information received from the then-anonymous tip, the police contacted the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) (now known as the United States Customs and Immigration Services) and obtained a fingerprint card for the defendant. It was later determined that the fingerprint from the balcony matched one on that card.", "Approximately one month after finding the man on her balcony, Durbin and her husband moved out of their apartment. Three or four days prior to moving, the Durbins held a furniture sale at their apartment. Durbin testified that she recalled seeing the defendant and his wife at the sale, and that she sold them some furniture. Durbin testified that she was startled by the defendant\u2019s presence at the sale because she believed, though was not certain, that she recognized him as the man from her balcony. Durbin also testified that even at the time of trial she could not be certain if the defendant was, in fact, the man on her balcony.", "In July 2003, with the defendant\u2019s wife acting as an interpreter, the police spoke with the defendant at his apartment. According to the interviewing officer\u2019s testimony, after being told that his fingerprint was found on the balcony, the defendant stated that he was not in Derry but in Boston on May 29. Later in the interview, the defendant stated that he was in Colombia on that day, but then stated that he had actually returned from Colombia before May 29. According to the officer, the defendant explained that his fingerprint might have been found in Durbin\u2019s apartment because he had been there to buy furniture, or because he had visited a prior tenant there, but he could not recall the tenant\u2019s last name. At the conclusion of the interview, the police received the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s permission to search her two cars and a slightly bent, orange-handled screwdriver was found in one.", "The defendant was subsequently indicted for attempted burglary. Prior to trial, he moved to quash the indictment, arguing that it was defective. The Trial Court (Morrill, J.) denied the motion. He renewed his argument in a motion to dismiss at the close of the State\u2019s case, which the Trial Court (Coffey, J.) also denied. Additionally, before trial the defendant moved to preclude the State from referring to the anonymous telephone call or from disclosing its contents. The Trial Court (Coffey, J.), however, admitted testimony about the call, subject to certain limitations. The defendant appealed these rulings following his conviction for attempted burglary.", "On appeal the defendant first contends, under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, that the trial court erred in denying his motions to quash and dismiss because the indictment was inadequate. According to the defendant, because burglary is essentially an attempt to enter a building to commit some other offense, for a burglary indictment to be adequate, it must allege which crime the perpetrator would have committed in furtherance of the burglary. The defendant contends that because a burglary indictment must allege the crime to be committed, so must an indictment for attempted burglary. Because the indictment here did not allege what other offense would be committed upon entry, it was defective.", "\u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with a purpose that a crime be committed, he does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the crime.\u201d RSA 629:1, I. Attempt is an inchoate crime that is considered a substantive offense in and of itself. State v. Johnson, 144 N.H. 175, 178 (1999). To be constitutionally adequate, an indictment charging an attempt must allege both an intent to commit a crime and an overt act in furtherance of the crime. Id. at 177, 178. However, while the attempt statute requires the State to identify the intended offense, it does not require the State to plead and prove the elements of the intended offense and it is ordinarily sufficient to state the intended offense generally. Id. at 178. \u201cSince an attempted crime is by definition a crime not completed, the State could not plead, factually identify, and prove the elements of the intended offense as if it had been carried out.\u201d Id.", "Here, the indictment alleges that the defendant had the requisite intent and alleges an overt act in furtherance of the crime as well as the crime attempted, i.e., burglary. Therefore, it is constitutionally adequate. Id. at 177, 178. Charging the defendant with attempted burglary does not require the State to specify the offense the defendant would have committed in furtherance of the burglary. Requiring the State to comply with the defendant\u2019s argument would require it to plead and prove the elements of the crime attempted, a result contrary to Johnson. Moreover, such a requirement would force the State to prove more than is required by the attempt statute, see RSA 629:1, I. The indictment meets the requirements for an adequate attempt charge and it describes the offense with sufficient specificity to allow the defendant to prepare for trial. Id. at 177.", "The defendant argues that not requiring the State to identify the crime to be committed would leave the jury to speculate about what crime would have been committed. Permitting such speculation, according to the defendant, is impermissible because the jury could convict the defendant without reaching a unanimous decision regarding the crime that would have been committed. Unanimity, however, is required only as to the elements of the crime charged. See State v. Greene, 137 N.H. 126, 128 (1993) (\u201cThe New Hampshire Criminal Code requires jury unanimity with respect to the presence of the elements of offenses in criminal cases as charged.\u201d). Here, the crime charged is attempted burglary, and unanimity is needed only as to its elements. What crime or offense the defendant would have committed in furtherance of the burglary is not an element of attempt, and, therefore, does not require unanimity. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to quash and dismiss.", "Next, the defendant contends that in admitting the officer\u2019s testimony regarding the substance of his conversation with the anonymous caller, the trial court violated his right of confrontation under both the State and Federal Constitutions. See N.H. CONST., pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amends. VI, XIV. Before trial, the defendant sought to exclude testimony regarding the anonymous call, but the trial court nevertheless permitted the State to introduce portions of the call through Charewicz, which the State did. The defendant argues that admitting Charewicz\u2019s testimony was error.", "We address first the defendant\u2019s argument under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. See State v. Miller, 155 N.H. 246, 253 (2007). The defendant contends that his rights under the State Constitution were violated because admitting Charewicz\u2019s testimony was contrary to Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). We have not , however, adopted the Crawford analysis as applicable in this State, see State v. Ayer, 154 N.H. 500, 511 (2006), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 63 (2007), and the defendant does not argue that we should do so here. Moreover, the defendant offers no argument under any other standard regarding the violation of his rights under the State Constitution. See id. (noting that we have traditionally applied the analysis in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980), to Confrontation Clause challenges under the State Constitution). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant does not prevail on his claim under the New Hampshire Constitution.", "In support of his claim under the Federal Constitution, the defendant relies principally upon Crawford, wherein the United States Supreme Court held that testimonial hearsay is inadmissible under the Federal Confrontation Clause unless the declarant is unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68. As the First Circuit has stated:", "Crawford holds that a declarant\u2019s \u201ctestimonial\u201d out-of-court", "statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless", "(1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior", "opportunity for cross-examination and the declarant is", "unavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other than", "establishing the truth of the matter asserted. United States v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2006) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 568 (2007); see also Ayer, 154 N.H. at 505. Here, it is undisputed that Pena did not testify and that the defendant never had an opportunity to cross-examine her. Accordingly, resolution of the instant matter requires us to determine whether the evidence was admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.", "\u201cThe Supreme Court has held in several instances that nonhearsay statements do not implicate the Confrontation Clause.\u201d United States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1199 (2006). Moreover, \u201c[i]n several cases, [the First Circuit] has held that when statements are offered only to provide context and not for the truth of the matter asserted, those statements are not hearsay.\u201d Id. The \u201c\u2018context\u2019 rationale,\u201d however, does not provide unlimited discretion to permit police testimony; what is most important is the precise nature of the context provided. Maher, 454 F.3d at 22. Here, the State argues that Pena\u2019s statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that the defendant attempted to burglarize Durbin\u2019s apartment, but to provide context for the investigation that followed. Indeed, the trial court ruled that Charewicz\u2019s testimony about the caller\u2019s statements was admissible to show the state of mind of the police, and the basis for their contact with INS. The defendant, however, contends that the testimony was offered to show that he had committed the crime.", "As noted previously, before trial, the defendant sought to exclude all references to the telephonic tip and its contents. The State countered that the testimony regarding the tip would not be offered for its truth, but only to show why the investigation \u201ctook the turn that it did.\u201d The defendant then offered to permit the State to say that \u201ca police investigation led us to suspect [the defendant].\u201d This compromise was rejected by the trial court because it believed such a statement would imply that the police were aware of past criminal activity by the defendant, and would thus unfairly prejudice him. In the end, the trial court permitted the prosecution to admit Charewicz\u2019s testimony to the extent it would relate that the tipster said the defendant was one the police ought to \u201clook at\u201d in the Fairways attempted burglary, and that the caller gave a physical description of the defendant and knew the defendant because they were from the same country. The trial court stated that this testimony would be admitted in:", "the manner in which we would similarly put in any kind of", "anonymous tip that\u2019s called in, that it\u2019s being offered to show the", "state of mind of the police and it\u2019s on that basis, that they", "predicated their next step, which was the fingerprint analysis.", "They had somewhere to go for that. Thus, the trial court ruled that the testimony would not be admitted for its truth, but only to show why the police contacted INS and began investigating the defendant.", "In his opening statement, the prosecutor relayed to the jury the contents of the call consistent with the trial court\u2019s ruling, and informed them that the description provided by the caller was the same as that given by Durbin. The prosecutor then informed the jury that based upon the information provided in the call, the police contacted INS. Later, the State introduced Charewicz\u2019s testimony as described previously, using leading questions so as to tailor the testimony to the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling. Finally, in its closing, the State again related to the jury that the caller had given the police the defendant\u2019s name and physical description and had stated that she and the defendant were from the same country, and that as a result of this call the police contacted INS.", "\u201cIt is well settled that where a conversation is relevant irrespective of the truth of what is said, the hearsay rule does not operate to exclude the testimony.\u201d State v. Martineau, 116 N.H. 797, 798 (1976). Here, the trial court ruled that the testimony, as it has been described, would not be admitted for its truth, but only to show that a tip was given and that the police acted upon the information received. Thus, the trial court recognized that it was relevant that the conversation occurred and that it prompted the police to contact INS, regardless of whether the information in the call was, in fact, true. Accordingly, testimony about the call was admissible for a non-hearsay purpose. While the trial court did not issue an instruction to the jury informing them of the limited purpose for the testimony, the trial court had no obligation to do so absent a request therefore, or an objection to the lack thereof, by the defendant. See State v. Pelletier, 149 N.H. 243, 253 (2003).", "The defendant contends that \u201cif the statement was being admitted to show the police officers\u2019 state of mind, . . . then there was no need to include the caller\u2019s physical description of the defendant or her statement that [the defendant] was the one who committed the attempted break-in.\u201d The trial court, however, ruled that this information was permissible to show why the police contacted INS, as opposed to continuing their investigation in some other way. As argued by the prosecutor, \u201cIt has to make sense. Why would they go to INS?\u201d In other contexts, we have noted that in assessing whether it is reasonable for the police to pursue an anonymous tip, we examine the reliability and credibility of the informant, and his or her basis of knowledge, as well as the quantity, quality and reliability of the information given. State v. Sousa, 151 N.H. 297, 299 (2004). Here, inclusion of information such as the description and the provision of a name in reference to a particular incident helped to explain why the police might consider the tip to be reliable and why contacting INS for the defendant\u2019s fingerprint card was a reasonable step in light of the information obtained. Accordingly, because the information conveyed to the jury served to demonstrate the reasonableness of the police action in contacting INS, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the evidence on that ground was not error.", "The defendant also contends that the testimony about the tip was offered for its truth because, during opening statements, the prosecutor used the information in the tip to corroborate the description given by Durbin. The defendant, however, made no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument during trial. Any argument that the State strayed beyond the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling that the evidence was admitted for a limited, non-hearsay purpose should have been made to the trial court in the first instance, and we will not entertain objections that were not raised during the proceedings below because they are not preserved for our review. State v. Wong, 138 N.H. 56, 66 (1993).", "Finally, the defendant contends that even if Charewicz\u2019s testimony was not hearsay, it was more prejudicial than probative, and, therefore, should not have been admitted. See N.H. R. Ev. 403. The State counters that the issue has not been preserved, or, if it has, the defendant does not prevail. As pointed out by the State, at no point did the defendant object to the introduction of any part of Charewicz\u2019s testimony on the ground that it would be more prejudicial than probative, nor did he invoke Rule 403\u2019s balancing of probative and prejudicial effect. His objection was based upon the Confrontation Clause and not upon the supposed prejudicial nature of the evidence. In fact, the only time prejudice was mentioned was when the trial court ruled, without comment or objection from the defendant, that some portions of the call would be excluded as unfairly prejudicial. Even after this ruling, the defendant did not contend that the testimony permitted by the trial court was more prejudicial than probative. For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant has failed to preserve the issue for our review. See State v. Pepin, 156 N.H. 269, 275 (2007).", "For the above reasons, we conclude that Charewicz\u2019s testimony was properly admitted by the trial court for a non-hearsay purpose. Accordingly, the testimony was not barred by Crawford.", "Affirmed.", "BRODERICK, C.J., and DALIANIS and HICKS, JJ., concurred.

Following a jury trial in the Superior Court (Barry, J.), the defendant, Scott Robinson, was convicted of robbery and first degree assault. See RSA 636:1 (2007); RSA 631:1 (2007). He appeals his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We reverse and remand.", "The record supports the following facts. On March 18, 2006, around 9:50 p.m., Manchester police responded to a reported robbery at the Cross Town Variety Store. Upon arriving, witnesses told police that a white male, twenty-five to thirty years old, roughly six feet tall and weighing 200 pounds, wearing a Patriots jacket and a green hooded sweatshirt, entered the store, went behind the counter, and stabbed the clerk at least three times before leaving with cash from the register. A witness told police that he had followed the suspect as he left the store, and watched him run past a car and into an alley off Amory Street.", "Upon searching the area behind the counter, police found a key ring, containing three keys, one of which belonged to a Kia automobile. After the employees denied that it belonged to any of them, the police presumed that it belonged to the suspect. Responding officers were then told to be on the lookout for a Kia in the area. Officers found a Kia nearby, and confirmed that the fleeing suspect had run past that car before turning into the alley. After relaying the license plate to dispatch, police learned that the car belonged to the defendant, that he lived eight blocks from the store in the direction the suspect had run, and that he had a prior robbery conviction. At that point, officers were sent to the defendant\u2019s apartment building.", "While those officers were en route, another officer took the car key from the crime scene, inserted it into the door of the Kia and turned it; they matched. The officer relayed that information to the officers at the defendant\u2019s apartment building. By approximately 10:30 p.m., four officers were present outside the defendant\u2019s building. Officers outside the building could see movement inside, and those in the hallway outside the defendant\u2019s apartment could hear movement in the apartment. Officers also observed what appeared to be wet footprints in the hallway leading to the defendant\u2019s apartment door.", "The officers knocked on the defendant\u2019s door and announced their presence but received no response. They then spoke to a neighbor and asked her if the defendant lived in that apartment. After officers brought her down to a police cruiser and showed her a picture of the defendant on a computer, she confirmed that he lived there. Upon returning to the defendant\u2019s door, police heard a female voice say something to the effect of \u201cyou\u2019re such an idiot,\u201d and again knocked and announced their presence.", "When the officers heard footsteps approaching the door, they unholstered their weapons and pointed them at the ground. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Kimberly Dunn, opened the door, at which point the officers raised their weapons, told her to get on her knees and searched her for a weapon. The trial court found that two officers simultaneously stepped into the apartment and opened a closed closet to ensure nobody was hiding there. Upon opening the closet, the officers saw a Patriots jacket and a green hooded sweatshirt.", "Dunn then told the officers that the defendant was in the bedroom with a knife to his chest. The officers went to the bedroom, found the defendant, arrested him and took him out of the apartment. After conducting only a brief search for possible threats, the officers secured the premises and applied for a search warrant. At no time prior to entering the defendant\u2019s home did the officers attempt to secure a search or arrest warrant. Upon execution of the warrant, police seized a green sweatshirt, a Patriots jacket and a knife.", "Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence found in his apartment, arguing that the officers\u2019 initial warrantless entry was unconstitutional. Following a suppression hearing, the trial court denied his motion in a written order. After a jury convicted the defendant of robbery and first degree assault, he filed this appeal.", "On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, he argues that: (1) the officer\u2019s insertion of the key into the car door was a warrantless search and violated his constitutional rights; (2) the police lacked probable cause to enter his home; and (3) no exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless entry into his apartment.", "When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the trial court\u2019s findings unless they are unsupported by the record or clearly erroneous. State v. Pseudae, 154 N.H. 196, 199 (2006). We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. Id.", "We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the officer\u2019s insertion of the key into the Kia door was an unconstitutional search under both the Federal and State Constitutions. The trial court found that the police did not rely upon the key match in forming probable cause, and thus made no ruling on the issue. In the interests of judicial economy, however, we address the issue as it is likely to arise on remand and because there are sufficient facts in the record upon which we can reach our conclusion as a matter of law. Cf. Auger v. Town of Strafford, 156 N.H. 64, 67 (2007). We initially address the defendant\u2019s claim under the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 232\u201333 (1983).", "Part I, Article 19 provides that \u201c[e]very subject hath a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.\u201d \u201cWe have . . . recognized that an expectation of privacy plays a role in the protection afforded under Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d State v. Goss, 150 N.H. 46, 48 (2003). Thus, without an invasion of the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy, there has been no violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Part I, Article 19. Compare Goss, 150 N.H. at 48-49 (holding defendant has reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of black garbage bags left out for collection), with State v. Johnston, 150 N.H. 448, 452 (2004) (holding defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in curtilage to his home when there was no gate, he had not posted \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs and the driveway was visible from the street).", "The State argues that Part I, Article 19 does not apply in this case because the insertion of the key into the door does not constitute a search for constitutional purposes. Indeed, the defendant acknowledges that federal courts have minimized the zone of protection with regard to inserting a key into a door. He argues, however, that we should adopt a standard of greater protection under the State Constitution. Although we have recognized that our constitution does, in some circumstances, provide greater protection than the Federal Constitution, see, e.g., State v. Beauchesne, 151 N.H. 803, 812 (2005), this is not such a case.", "Here, the privacy interest at stake is \u201cso small that the officers do not need probable cause to inspect it.\u201d United States v. Concepcion, 942 F.2d 1170, 1173 (7th Cir. 1991); accord United States v. Lyons, 898 F.2d 210, 212- 13 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920 (1990); United States v. DeBardeleben, 740 F.2d 440, 443-45 (6th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1028 (1984); Com. v. Alvarez, 661 N.E.2d 1293, 1303 (Mass. 1996). Because vehicles must be registered and display license plates, see RSA 261:40 (Supp. 2008); RSA 261:75, II (2004), who owns a car is not private information. See United States v. Grandstaff, 813 F.2d 1353, 1358 n.6 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 837 (1987). Rather, the private information protected by Part I, Article 19 is what lies behind the door. In this case, the officer removed the key from the convenience store with the permission of the store owner, inserted the key into the lock and turned the key. He did not open the door or conduct any search of the vehicle. Because the officer did not intrude upon the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy, the defendant\u2019s rights under Part I, Article 19 were not violated.", "The defendant also argues that our ruling in this case is dictated by our prior rejection of an \u201cidentification search\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Webber, 141 N.H. 817, 821 (1997). The case is inapplicable here. In Webber, a police officer reached into the defendant\u2019s wallet to remove a prescription card without the defendant\u2019s permission. Id. at 818. Our rejection of the exception was based upon the fact that the officer unreasonably searched the defendant\u2019s wallet, not upon the nature of what the officer sought. Id. at 821. Thus, Webber is inapposite to this case.", "We reach the same result under the Federal Constitution. Whether the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated turns upon whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the thing searched. As federal courts have consistently held, the mere information of ownership obtained from inserting a key into a door is not the type of information in which a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Concepcion, 942 F.2d at 1173; Lyons, 898 F.2d at 212-13; Grandstaff, 813 F.2d at 1358 n.6; DeBardeleben, 740 F.2d at 443-45. Because the defendant had no expectation of privacy in this case, the officer\u2019s conduct did not violate the protections of the Fourth Amendment.", "As to the defendant\u2019s second argument, we will assume, without deciding, that the police had probable cause to enter his apartment. The issue before us, therefore, is whether exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into his home. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the New Hampshire Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. See Ball, 124 N.H. at 232-33.", "Under Part I, Article 19, a warrantless search or seizure is per se unreasonable, and evidence derived from such a search or seizure is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. State v. Santana, 133 N.H. 798, 803 (1991); State v. Beede, 119 N.H. 620, 625 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 983 (1980). The search of a home is subject to a particularly stringent warrant requirement because the occupant has a high expectation of privacy. State v. Theodosopoulos, 119 N.H. 573, 580 (1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 967 (1980). As the United States Supreme Court has recently made clear, exceptions to the warrant requirement must remain closely tethered to their underlying justifications lest they become incompatible with the fundamental principles secured by the Constitution. See Arizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 1719 (2009). The State has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the warrantless entry fell within one of the narrow, judicially- crafted exceptions. State v. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. 100, 103 (2008).", "One such exception, which the State argues applies here, exists where police have probable cause to enter a home and exigent circumstances make it impracticable to obtain a warrant beforehand. State v. Graca, 142 N.H. 670, 673 (1998). Exigent circumstances exist where police face a compelling need for immediate official action and a risk that the delay inherent in obtaining a warrant will present a substantial threat of imminent danger to life or public safety or create a likelihood that evidence will be destroyed. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 104; State v. MacElman, 149 N.H. 795, 798 (2003). Whether exigent circumstances exist is judged by the totality of the circumstances, and is largely a question of fact for the trial court. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 104. Our totality review includes an examination of the overall reasonableness of the officers\u2019 conduct prior to entry, but no single factor controls. Santana, 133 N.H. at 804. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s finding of exigent circumstances unless is it clearly erroneous. Id.", "Here, the trial court determined that exigency existed because the officers, upon arriving at the defendant\u2019s home, \u201cwere essentially in hot pursuit, without time to reflect upon the situation or obtain a warrant.\u201d The trial court directed the majority of its analysis to the officers\u2019 actions after the defendant\u2019s girlfriend opened the door. Even the State acknowledges, however, that this case is not one of hot pursuit, which \u201crequires immediate and continuous pursuit of a defendant from the scene of a crime.\u201d State v. Ricci, 144 N.H. 241, 244 (1999). In Ricci, for example, police followed an intoxicated driver to his house, and then ran inside after him when the driver tried to hide in his home. Id. at 242. Here, police arrived at the defendant\u2019s home approximately forty to forty-five minutes after the robbery was reported; such a delay cannot be considered hot pursuit.", "The defendant concedes that exigent circumstances existed once Dunn told the officers that the defendant had a knife to his chest. He argues, however, that the police themselves created the exigent circumstances, which did not exist before they entered his home.", "As the defendant points out, \u201cThe primary focus of our inquiry . . . is not on the sufficiency of the exigency but rather how the exigency came about.\u201d Santana, 133 N.H. at 805. Thus, if no exigency existed before the police became involved, the police cannot themselves create the exigency to justify a warrantless entry. Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 108; Santana, 133 N.H. at 807; Theodosopoulos, 119 N.H. at 581. In our analysis of whether police presence was the cause of the exigency, two considerations act as \u201cguideposts\u201d: (1) the presence or absence of \u201cample opportunity\u201d to get a warrant; and (2) the degree to which the exigency relied upon by the State was foreseeable. See Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 108 (quotation omitted).", "In Rodriguez, for example, police officers detected the odor of burning marijuana outside a hotel room while investigating an unrelated crime. Id. Because the officers had not gone to the hotel to investigate the drug crime, we found that the exigency was not foreseeable. Id. at 109. Thus, in light of the ongoing destruction of evidence in the hotel room, there was no opportunity to secure a warrant before knocking and entering. Id. at 110. We therefore held that the trial court\u2019s finding of exigent circumstances was not clearly erroneous. Id. at 110; see Santana, 133 N.H. at 807 (police may not rely upon an \u201cexpected exigency\u201d to justify warrantless entry into defendant\u2019s apartment where \u201cpolice, with ample probable cause, time to obtain a warrant, and time for reflection, choose to pursue a course of action which they know at the outset [would] present a situation requiring an emergency entrance into a person\u2019s home\u201d); Mendez v. People, 986 P.2d 275, 282 (Colo. 1999) (affirming finding of exigency because police encounter was inadvertent and no officer \u201cmade a deliberate decision to go to the motel\u201d to gather evidence of that particular crime), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1070 (2000).", "Here, police made the deliberate determination to go to the defendant\u2019s home to investigate the robbery. The State argues that the defendant posed a danger to others based upon the robbery, and that the police therefore faced exigent circumstances requiring immediate action. As discussed below, however, the State cannot point to any evidence that would have led the police to reasonably conclude that the defendant continued to pose a threat once he retreated to his apartment. It was not until after police entered his home that they knew of the specific exigency of the defendant holding a knife to his chest. Two officers testified that they secured Dunn and simultaneously searched a nearby closet for a concealed individual, at which time Dunn informed them that the defendant was in the bedroom with a knife to his chest. By that point, however, the officers had already entered his home without consent, and without first obtaining a warrant. Because the police had no knowledge of any exigency until after they entered the home, the State cannot now rely upon the ensuing emergency to justify the initial entry. See Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 108; Santana, 133 N.H. at 807.", "The State argues, however, that exigency existed prior to the officers\u2019 entry into the apartment and Dunn\u2019s statement. Specifically, the State argues that the facts of this case support a \u201cfleeing suspect\u201d exigency. In support, the State cites Dorman v. United States, 435 F.2d 385 (D.C. Cir. 1970). There, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set forth six factors that may be useful for determining exigency: (1) a grave offense occurred, particularly one involving violence; (2) the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed; (3) there exists not merely the minimum of probable cause, but beyond that a clear showing of probable cause; (4) there is strong reason to believe that the suspect is in the premises being entered; (5) there is a likelihood that the suspect will escape if not swiftly apprehended; and (6) the circumstance that the entry, though not consented, is made peaceably. Dorman, 435 F.2d at 392\u201393. Dorman also considered the time of entry and the actual difficulty police faced in obtaining a warrant. Id. at 394\u201395.", "Although federal courts have diverged in their acceptance and application of the Dorman test, the United States Supreme Court remained largely silent on the matter until Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91 (1990). In Olson, a lone gunman robbed a gas station shortly before 6:00 a.m., fatally shooting the manager. Olson, 495 U.S. at 93. Police drove to the house of a suspect, and met another car, driven by the defendant, in which the suspected gunman was a passenger. Id. The two men fled from the car and the gunman was captured, but the defendant managed to escape. Id. Inside the car, police found materials identifying the defendant. Id. The next morning, a woman called the police and said that the defendant had driven the car in the robbery and that he planned to leave town by bus. Id. She also gave an address for two women who knew where to find the defendant. Id. Later that afternoon, police surrounded the home. Id. at 94. After they determined that the defendant was inside, they entered the house without permission or a warrant and with weapons drawn. Id. The Minnesota Supreme Court applied the Dorman analysis and determined that no exigency existed. State v. Olson, 436 N.W.2d 92, 97 & n.1 (Minn. 1989).", "On appeal, the United States Supreme Court did not expressly adopt or reject Dorman, but held that the Minnesota Supreme Court \u201capplied essentially the correct standard in determining whether exigent circumstances existed.\u201d Olson, 495 U.S. at 100. The Court noted that the state supreme court observed that \u201ca warrantless intrusion may be justified by hot pursuit of a fleeing felon, or imminent destruction of evidence, or the need to prevent a suspect\u2019s escape, or the risk of danger to the police or to other persons inside or outside the dwelling.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). The Court also noted that the state court considered \u201cthe gravity of the crime and the likelihood that the suspect is armed.\u201d Id. The Court stated that it was \u201cnot inclined to disagree with this fact-specific application of the proper legal standard,\u201d and affirmed the state court\u2019s finding that no exigency occurred. Id.", "We see no need to adopt Dorman in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Olson. We, like the Court, have consistently held that the determination of exigency rests upon the totality of the circumstances. See Rodriguez, 157 N.H. at 104; Santana, 133 N.H. at 804. Police, as well as courts reviewing a warrantless entry, should consider the danger of imminent destruction of evidence, the gravity of the offense, the likelihood the suspect is armed, the need to prevent a suspect\u2019s escape, and the risk of danger to the police or to other persons inside or outside the dwelling. See Olson, 495 U.S. at 100; Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 753 (1984). In this case, although the gravity of the offense was serious and the defendant was believed to be armed, our examination of the totality of the circumstances forces us to conclude that no exigency existed that made it impractical to secure a warrant beforehand.", "The State cannot point to any substantive evidence that would have led officers to believe that the defendant would either destroy evidence or attempt to flee his home, or that he posed a risk if not immediately apprehended. Compare State v. Morse, 125 N.H. 403, 409 (1984) (holding no exigency when \u201cofficers had no apparent grounds for a belief that the defendant would escape\u201d), with United States v. Williams, 612 F.2d 735, 737 (3d Cir. 1979) (finding exigency where defendant was armed and reliable informant told police he planned to \u201cget his affairs together and then head south\u201d), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 934 (1980). Indeed, an officer at the suppression hearing testified that they had no reason to believe evidence was being destroyed or would be if they did not act quickly, and no officer articulated a fear that the defendant would escape. See Welsh, 466 U.S. at 751 (\u201cWhen an officer undertakes to act as his own magistrate, he ought to be in a position to justify it by pointing to some real immediate and serious consequences if he postponed action to get a warrant.\u201d (quotation omitted)).", "The situation here is similar to that in Olson, where there was no risk of immediate flight, no suggestion of danger to officers, and \u201c[t]hree or four Minneapolis police squads surrounded the house.\u201d Olson, 495 U.S. at 101 (quotation omitted). Had Olson come out, \u201che would have been promptly apprehended.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). Here, police had no specific information that the defendant intended to flee, and, indeed, had his apartment surrounded so as to prevent flight. Furthermore, before officers knocked on his door, there was no evidence that the defendant was an immediate danger to himself, to the police or to the other person in the apartment. Although the State argues that he was at least a danger to Dunn based upon his conduct at the store, it cannot point to any other evidence to suggest that she was actually in danger. See State v. Slade, 116 N.H. 436, 438 (1976) (holding gunshots in home justified warrantless police entry to determine whether there was a victim); see also United States v. Holloway, 290 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (11th Cir. 2002) (listing cases and situations in which endangerment to life justified warrantless entry), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1161 (2003); People v. McBride, 872 N.Y.S. 2d 109 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009) (finding exigent circumstances when police observed distraught and hyperventilating woman through window who was unable to respond to inquiries about what was happening). Indeed, the fact that the defendant had returned to his own home during the night hours militates against a finding of exigency. See Hathock v. Cohen, 547 F. Supp. 2d 1271, 1277 n.7 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (noting that burglary suspect fleeing into \u201canother\u2019s home gives rise to exigent circumstances whereas a suspect entering his own home does not\u201d).", "The State argues that the facts here are analogous to Theodosopoulos, in which we held that exigent circumstances existed. Theodosopoulos, 119 N.H. 573. There, a sniper fired a shot into a police station, seriously injuring an officer and a civilian. Id. at 576. Police then methodically searched neighboring buildings until forcing their way into the defendant\u2019s apartment. Id. at 577. They found him apparently asleep in the bedroom, with a riflescope and spent shell casings on a table and marijuana plants on the floor. Id. at 578. We held that the nature of the \u201chighly volatile\u201d emergency and the need to protect the public from further harm justified the warrantless search of the area and the defendant\u2019s apartment. Id. at 580\u201381. The State argues that this case is similar in that both cases involved only one incident of violence and a continuous, methodical search for the suspect. Here, however, police had no reason to believe that the defendant posed any danger in his current location, whereas in Theodosopoulos, police were unsure of the sniper\u2019s location and reasonably feared he might fire again if not apprehended.", "Finally, we consider the fact that the officers did not even attempt to obtain a warrant after learning the location of the defendant\u2019s home. In Dorman, for example, police were unable to obtain a warrant because the magistrates who were supposed to be available that night were not. Dorman, 435 F.2d at 394-95; see United States v. Campbell, 581 F.2d 22, 27 (2d Cir. 1978) (considering fact that although no warrant application was filed, officers did contact an Assistant United States Attorney for an evaluation of their situation, and thus \u201cshowed their respect for the Fourth Amendment\u201d). But see State v. Steimel, 155 N.H. 141, 149 (2007) (holding officer does not necessarily need to attempt to find a magistrate when time lost would risk destruction of evidence). In contrast, the Supreme Court held in Olson that once police had the home surrounded and foreclosed the defendant\u2019s escape, they were required to obtain a warrant. Olson, 495 U.S. at 101. Here, police had surrounded the defendant\u2019s apartment and effectively foreclosed the possibility of flight.", "Because the record does not reveal any evidence that would have led the police to reasonably believe that the defendant continued to pose a danger to himself, to the police or to the other occupant in the apartment, because the police had blocked any routes of escape, and because the officers testified that they had no reason to believe evidence was being or would be destroyed, we hold that no exigent circumstances existed requiring immediate, warrantless entry. The trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was therefore clearly erroneous.", "In light of our ruling under the State Constitution, we need not reach the federal issue.

In April 2008, Detective Kevin Rourke of the Nashua Police Department worked with a confidential informant on a drug investigation. The investigation focused on Radhames Melo and the defendant; the police suspected that both men were dealing drugs. Allegedly, the defendant, at Melo\u2019s direction, repeatedly traveled from New Hampshire to New York City and then to the Dominican Republic, where he picked up approximately 500 grams of heroin. The defendant swallowed the drugs, returned to New Hampshire, and met Melo at a hotel, where he expelled them.", "Following one of these trips, Detective Rourke and the confidential informant completed two drug purchases from Melo and the defendant. The second took place at the defendant\u2019s apartment, located in a multi-family house on Perham Street in Nashua. Detective Rourke gave the informant money to buy heroin and watched him enter the apartment; shortly thereafter, the informant left and delivered a package of heroin to Detective Rourke. A surveillance team monitored the informant\u2019s movements, and the police confirmed that the substance was heroin.", "Detective Rourke applied for and received a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment. The warrant permitted the seizure of \u201cIdentification, documents and records relating to the trafficking of Narcotic drugs as well as other contraband listed in Attachment \u2018A\u2019, cellular phones and the information contained Therein, contrary to Revised Statutes Annotated 318-B:2.\u201d Attachment A listed many items, including United States currency, drug use paraphernalia, firearms, documents identifying the apartment\u2019s occupants, and records relating to drug trafficking.

They discovered thirty-one individually wrapped bags of heroin inside the pocket of a vest hanging in a bedroom closet. The police confiscated the drugs and arrested the defendant shortly thereafter.", "Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the heroin, arguing that the police unlawfully seized it under the plain view exception because they did not inadvertently discover it.

While we currently require the discovery to be inadvertent under our state constitutional analysis, see Davis, 149 N.H. at 700-01, we have also stated that inadvertency is not required for guns as they are \u201cdangerous in themselves.\u201d State v. Slade, 116 N.H. 436, 439 (1976) (citing Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 439).", "Some state courts have followed Horton and completely abolished the inadvertency requirement. See, e.g., State v. Loh, 914 P.2d 592, 600 (Mont. 1996); State v. Julius, 408 S.E.2d 1, 7 (W. Va. 1991). Hawaii and Massachusetts have declined to follow Horton and continue to require inadvertency. See Com. v. Balicki, 762 N.E.2d 290, 298 (Mass. 2002); State v. Meyer, 893 P.2d 159, 165 n.6 (Haw. 1995). A few courts have recognized the exception for objects that are \u201ccontraband,\u201d \u201cstolen,\u201d or \u201cdangerous in themselves\u201d set out in Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 471. See, e.g., State v. Eady, 733 A.2d 112, 116 n.7 (Conn.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1030 (1999); State v. Nieves, 782 A.2d 203, 207 n.6 (Conn. App. Ct. 2001); Com. v. LaPlante, 622 N.E.2d 1357, 1361 n.9 (Mass. 1993) (inadvertency requirement does not apply to stolen goods). But see Balicki, 762 N.E.2d at 298 (finding that inadvertency requirement \u201ccontinues to protect the possessory interests conferred on our citizens by\u201d state constitution).", "We hold today that, with respect to drugs, weapons, and other items \u201cdangerous in themselves,\u201d there is no longer an inadvertency requirement under our State Constitution. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 471; see Eady, 733 A.2d at 116 n.7; Com. v. Hason, 439 N.E.2d 251, 256 (Mass. 1982). Thus, we need not consider the State\u2019s argument that we should adopt Horton.", "Like the Fourth Amendment, Part I, Article 19 protects both the rights to privacy and to possessory property interests. See Horton, 496 U.S. at 143 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Although the inadvertency requirement does not further privacy rights, it protects an individual\u2019s possessory interest in his or her property. Id. at 147. Accordingly, even though the observation or seizure of an article in plain view \u201cwould [not] involve any invasion of privacy . . . [a] seizure of the article . . . would obviously invade the owner\u2019s possessory interest.\u201d Id. at 133-34 (citations omitted). The need to protect such possessory interests in drugs, weapons, and other items \u201cdangerous in themselves,\u201d however, is not compelling. See Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 471; Slade, 116 N.H. at 439.", "Retaining the inadvertency requirement for such items will not deter police misconduct, as the police have no incentive not to include such items for which they have probable cause. \u201cIf the officer has knowledge approaching certainty that the item will be found, we see no reason why he or she would deliberately omit a particular description of the item to be seized from the application for a search warrant,\u201d as \u201c[s]pecification of the additional item could only permit the officer to expand the scope of the search.\u201d Horton, 496 U.S. at 138-39; see also 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 4.11(e), at 805-06 (4th ed. 2004) (noting that most plausible reason why police do not include item in warrant for which police have probable cause is \u201coversight or . . . an abundance of caution or . . . a misapprehension of what it takes to obtain a search warrant covering that evidence\u201d).", "Moreover, the warrant requirement provides \u201ctwo distinct constitutional protections\u201d: it eliminates searches not based upon probable cause by requiring the scrutiny of a detached and neutral magistrate; and it prevents \u201ca general, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings\u201d by requiring particularity. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 467. Although we abolish the inadvertency requirement for drugs, weapons, and other items dangerous in themselves, the initial intrusion under the plain view exception must still be justified by a warrant or an exception to the search warrant requirement. Id. \u201c[G]iven the initial intrusion, the seizure of an object in plain view is consistent with [the particularity requirement], since it does not convert the search into a general or exploratory one.\u201d Id. Eliminating inadvertency will not convert otherwise lawful searches into general exploratory searches, as all searches are already limited by search warrants or exceptions to the warrant requirement. See Horton, 496 U.S. at 139-40.", "Finally, retaining the inadvertency requirement for drugs, weapons, and other items dangerous in themselves would do little to further the principles underlying Part I, Article 19.", "Where, once an otherwise lawful search is in progress, the police", "inadvertently come upon a piece of evidence, it would often be a needless", "inconvenience, and sometimes dangerous \u2013 to the evidence or to the", "police themselves \u2013 to require them to ignore it until they have obtained a", "warrant particularly describing it. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 467-68.", "The defendant argues that we should follow the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, see Balicki, 762 N.E.2d at 298, and retain the inadvertency requirement under our State Constitution. In Balicki, the police suspected that the defendants were forging invoices from their employer, a vocational high school, to purchase household items with public funds for their personal use. Id. at 293. The police obtained a search warrant for the defendants\u2019 home, which authorized the seizure of seventeen specific items. Id. at 292-95. When the police executed the search warrant, Detective Lieutenant Patenaude \u201cdirected [a] photographer to photograph and videotape each room in the home and anything he identified to the photographer as having potential evidentiary value.\u201d Id. at 294-95.

See RSA 632-A:2, I(1) (2007); RSA 632-A:3, III (2007). On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court (Groff, J.) erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress; (2) denying his motion for a mistrial when a redacted portion of his interrogation was played to the jury; (3) permitting the State to ask him whether one of the complainants was lying; and (4) denying his motion to find a child witness incompetent to testify. We reverse and remand.", "Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have found or the record supports the following. From 2004 to 2006, the defendant lived in Nashua with his former wife and two children, C.P. and A.P. In 2006, the couple separated, and the children moved with their mother to upstate New York to live with their grandmother. The children\u2019s mother began to date another man whom the children started to call \u201cDad.\u201d One evening at the dinner table, C.P. and A.P. told their grandmother that they had been sexually assaulted by the defendant. The children\u2019s mother promptly reported this disclosure to New York authorities, sought a protective order against the defendant, and petitioned for full custody of the children in New York. The New York State police referred the case to the Nashua police.", "In June 2007, a Nashua police detective called the defendant and asked him to come to the police station for an interview. The detective told the defendant that there was no active warrant for his arrest. The defendant, who had moved to Georgia to live with his mother, declined the request, stating that he did not have the money to travel to Nashua. In July, the detective renewed his interview request upon learning that the defendant would be in New York to attend a protective order hearing concerning the alleged assault of C.P. and A.P. Eventually, the defendant agreed to come to Nashua.", "On July 11, after the hearing in New York, the defendant and his mother arrived at the Nashua police station. The police directed the defendant to a waiting room, permitted him to watch television, and served him a soda. The investigating officer, with whom the defendant had spoken on the phone, introduced himself to the defendant and led him to an interview room. Although the Nashua police already had obtained a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, he was not so informed before the interview.", "The defendant was told that the interview would be audio- and video- recorded, and was then advised of his Miranda rights. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966). He stated that he understood his rights but wanted to waive them and to speak with the detective. He also signed a waiver form. The detective proceeded to question the defendant about his personal history, children, and relationship with his wife. After approximately two hours, the detective directed the interview to the alleged sexual assault of C.P. and A.P. He explained that forensic examiners had interviewed the two children about the assaults and determined that \u201c[C.P.] and [A.P.] are telling the truth.\u201d He next told the defendant that his children missed him and that he needed to repair his relationship with the children. The following exchange then occurred:", "[DETECTIVE:] If I saw two children that were distraught by this,", "destroyed by this, hurt very badly by this, OK, I wouldn\u2019t be here", "talking to you. OK? I wouldn\u2019t be here trying to work things with", "you. OK? Because that\u2019s a different source, different scenario,", "different story. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re dealing with here. OK? This", "is a very simple matter. OK? A very simple thing. OK? What you", "tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and", "you. OK? I know [your] mom\u2019s here, OK?

I haven\u2019t bull . . . t you all, any of the", "time. I\u2019m telling you the straight up truth.", "After this exchange, the detective asked the defendant to discuss the specific events giving rise to the allegations of sexual assault. When the defendant was not immediately forthcoming, the detective interrupted to remind the defendant that the children had told the truth. The detective then said that he needed to hear the defendant admit that the children were telling the truth \u201cbefore I can say hey, you know what? This is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. It\u2019s all done. It\u2019s behind him. You know? Get a little counseling and, and it\u2019s over.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the detective again stated, \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t tell me the scenario, that, you know, what happened and what was going through your mind at the time, OK, we can\u2019t get [you] any counseling to fix the problem if you can\u2019t give us some clue as to what the problem was.\u201d The defendant then admitted to sexually assaulting C.P. and A.P. and the detective arrested him.", "Before trial, the defendant filed several motions relevant to this appeal. He first moved to suppress his oral statements, arguing they were involuntary under the Due Process Clauses of the Federal and New Hampshire Constitutions. The State objected, arguing that there was \u201cno evidence that the defendant\u2019s will was overwrought [sic] by any comment that was made\u201d by the detective. The trial court denied the motion.", "After a hearing, the defendant argued that A.P., who was then five years old, was not competent to testify because A.P. did not appreciate the consequences of lying. The trial court disagreed, ruling that A.P had demonstrated \u201csufficient capacity to observe, remember, and narrate, as well as to understand the duty to tell the truth.\u201d She was found competent to testify.", "The defendant moved to sever the trials on the indictments concerning the two children. The trial court granted this motion, resulting in separate trials. Because of the severance, the parties agreed to redact the transcript of the defendant\u2019s confession to omit any reference to the acts of sexual assault against A.P. at the trial for the sexual assault of C.P. These passages were blacked out with a marker. The parties also agreed to redact the video- recording of the confession by muting the sound.", "The trial involving C.P. occurred first. During the detective\u2019s testimony, the prosecution played the redacted video-recording and gave the jury the redacted transcript. At one point during the videotape, the defendant objected and moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecution had not properly redacted the videotape and that the jury heard \u201cwith [A.P.] at least twice.\u201d Based upon this statement, the defendant contended that the jury would infer that the defendant assaulted A.P., not just C.P. as alleged, and that the defendant discussed this assault in the redacted portions of the interrogation. The State maintained that the jury had heard nothing prejudicial and that the jury would infer only that A.P. may have witnessed the assault. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial.", "During his case, the defendant introduced evidence that his ex-wife\u2019s new boyfriend had assaulted C.P. The defense pointed to the fact that C.P. called the new boyfriend \u201cDad.\u201d The defense also elicited from C.P. that the boyfriend had shown C.P. his penis and \u201cdoes nice things when he shows [C.P.] his penis.\u201d Further, the defendant testified that he had never assaulted C.P.; he recanted his confession. He testified that the detective\u2019s assertion that a forensic examiner had found his children to be truthful led him to believe that everyone would think he was guilty. For this reason, the detective\u2019s promise that he would only have to attend counseling if he confessed sounded attractive, and, therefore, he confessed. Upon cross-examination, the State asked the defendant whether C.P. was lying. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the question impermissibly forced the defendant to judge the credibility of another witness. The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the defendant to respond. After two days of trial, the jury convicted the defendant of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault with a minor under the age of thirteen. See RSA 632-A:2, I(l).", "Approximately one month later, the trial for the alleged sexual assault of A.P. was held. The defendant testified he had never assaulted A.P. and again recanted his confession. The jury, however, found the defendant guilty of two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, see RSA 632-A:2, I(l), and two counts of felonious sexual assault with a minor under the age of thirteen, see RSA 632-A:3 III.", "The defendant appealed his convictions involving C.P. and A.P. separately. Because both cases are interrelated and challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we consider them together.", "The defendant argues that his statements to the police were involuntary, and, therefore, their admission at both trials violated his due process rights under the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. See N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amend XIV. We first address the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution and cite federal opinions for guidance only. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).", "Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o subject shall be . . . compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against himself\u201d and guarantees every citizen due process of law. N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. For a statement to be admissible at trial, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary. State v. Rezk, 150 N.H. 483, 486 (2004). Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact for the trial court to determine. State v. Hammond, 144 N.H. 401, 404 (1999). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s determination unless the manifest weight of the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the State is to the contrary. Rezk, 150 N.H. at 486.", "The focus of our voluntariness inquiry is \u201cwhether the actions of an individual are the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\u201d Hammond, 144 N.H. at 405 (quotation omitted); State v. Damiano, 124 N.H. 742, 747 (1984). The decision to confess \u201cmust be freely self-determined.\u201d In re Wesley B., 145 N.H. 428, 430 (2000) (quotation omitted). A confession cannot be \u201cthe product of a will overborne by police tactics, or of a mind incapable of a conscious choice.\u201d Hammond, 144 N.H. at 405 (quotation omitted). Generally, we make a determination of voluntariness in light of \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d Id.", "Here, the defendant argues that his confession was involuntary because the interviewing detective made impermissible promises of confidentiality and leniency, respectively. The detective told the defendant that \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.\u201d Later, the detective stated, \u201c[g]et a little counseling and . . . it\u2019s over,\u201d implying, according to the defendant, that if he confessed \u201che would only have to do counseling and that he would see his children\u201d; \u201che would not have to go to jail.\u201d The defendant contends that these promises \u201cwere so irresistible they rendered [his] confession involuntary.\u201d The State counters that the detective\u2019s statements were not promises of confidentiality or leniency. Moreover, relying principally upon Rezk, the State argues that \u201c[i]n light of the totality of the circumstances,\u201d including the detective\u2019s statements, \u201cthe trial court correctly found . . . that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.\u201d", "In Rezk, we employed a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether a defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary where a state agent had made an impermissible promise that was neither a promise of confidentiality nor a promise of immunity from prosecution. Rezk, 150 N.H. at 488. We stated:", "Under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, the existence of a", "promise made to the defendant is not dispositive. Rather, all the", "facts must be examined and their nuances assessed to determine", "whether, in making the promise, the police exerted such an", "influence on the defendant that his will was overborne. Id. (quotations omitted). To aid in this determination, we identified five factors that courts have considered, including: \u201c(1) the nature of the promise; (2) the context in which it was made; (3) the characteristics of the individual defendant; (4) whether the defendant was informed of his Miranda rights; and (5) whether counsel was present.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, we stated that \u201ccourts must give qualitative, rather than quantitative weight to the promise\u201d when analyzing the impact a promise has on overbearing a defendant\u2019s will. Id. (quotation omitted). \u201cEven a single factor may inevitably lead to a conclusion that under the totality of circumstances a suspect\u2019s will was overborne and the confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).", "The totality of the circumstances test, however, does not apply to promises of confidentiality or promises of immunity from prosecution. State v. McDermott, 131 N.H. 495, 501 (1989) (\u201cA confession made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality or a promise of immunity is involuntary and coerced under the State Constitution.\u201d); see Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487-88 (recognizing McDermott\u2019s per se rule as to promises of confidentiality or promises of immunity even though McDermott cited the totality of the circumstances test).", "In McDermott, we held a defendant\u2019s confession involuntary where a federal drug enforcement agent made an impermissible promise of confidentiality. McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501. The agent told the defendant that information he provided about a murder \u201cwould not leave the office,\u201d that the DEA \u201csimply needed the information . . . to avoid surprises\u201d at trial, and that the DEA would never obtain cooperation from informants if it prosecuted them with the information they provided. Id. at 499 (quotations omitted). He further told the defendant that his statements would not be used against him because he had never received his Miranda warnings. Id. We agreed with the trial court that these statements constituted impermissible promises of confidentiality and held the resulting confession involuntary. Id. at 501. We reasoned that \u201cto allow the government to revoke its promise after obtaining incriminating information obtained in reliance on that promise would be to sanction governmental deception in a manner violating due process.\u201d Id.", "Our holding in Rezk did not supplant McDermott\u2019s per se rule in favor of a totality of the circumstances test for promises of confidentiality and promises of immunity from prosecution. See Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487-88. In Rezk, we acknowledged that McDermott found such promises \u201ccategorically different\u201d and \u201climited our per se rule of involuntariness to promises of confidentiality and promises of immunity from prosecution.\u201d Id. at 487 (quotation omitted). For all other promises or threats, we examine the totality of the circumstances to determine \u201cwhether, in making the promise, the police exerted such an influence on the defendant that his will was overborne.\u201d Id. at 488. For example, in Rezk, we analyzed the effect of a police officer\u2019s promise of leniency on the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession under a totality of the circumstances test. Id. at 488-91. There, the defendant asked the interviewing officer \u201cwhat was in it for him\u201d if he cooperated. Id. at 485 (quotation omitted). The officer promised to not charge the defendant with the armed robberies that he allegedly committed two months previously and not to charge his associate. Id. Rather, the officer promised to charge the defendant only with the crimes he perpetrated the night of his arrest. Id. We held the resulting confessions involuntary because they \u201cwere induced by specific promises of leniency,\u201d id. at 491, that had \u201cthe likelihood of stripping the defendant of his capacity for self- determination.\u201d Id. at 489 (quotation and brackets omitted). The police officer \u201cdid more than merely exhort the defendant to be truthful\u201d or promise to recommend leniency to the prosecutor if the defendant confessed. Id. at 490.", "With these standards in mind, we analyze first whether the interviewing officer made an impermissible promise of confidentiality when he stated \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you\u201d and \u201cwhat you tell me in here, OK, doesn\u2019t have to go to [your mother].\u201d The State urges us to uphold the trial court\u2019s finding that while these statements \u201csuggest an atmosphere of confidentiality,\u201d they \u201ccould not reasonably be interpreted as a promise of confidentiality\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. In support of this finding, the trial court noted that the defendant: (1) knew of the allegations of sexual assault; (2) indicated that he would turn himself in if an arrest warrant were issued; (3) knew that his former wife was seeking a restraining order and had driven to a hearing in New York concerning that order with his mother; and (4) traveled voluntarily to the Nashua police station. Therefore, the trial court reasoned, \u201cit would have been na\u00efve of the defendant to believe that what he told [the detective] would remain solely between him and [the detective]\u201d because the defendant\u2019s mother inevitably would learn of the sexual assault.", "The trial court\u2019s finding that the detective\u2019s statements merely \u201csuggested an atmosphere of confidentiality,\u201d however, is against the manifest weight of the evidence. By focusing solely upon the context of the defendant\u2019s statements, the trial court failed to properly consider the plain meaning of the detective\u2019s statement. See Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487-91 (analyzing the plain meaning of the officer\u2019s statements in addition to the nature and context of the statement to determine that specific promises of leniency were made); see also Knight v. State, 850 A.2d 1179, 1189 (Md. 2004) (requiring that a court first objectively determine whether the interrogating officer made an explicit or implicit threat, promise, or inducement). The detective\u2019s statement \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you\u201d can reasonably be interpreted only one way \u2014 that what the defendant told the detective would be kept confidential. It is a promise of confidentiality. The detective\u2019s subsequent statement that \u201cwhat you tell me in here, OK, doesn\u2019t have to go to [your mother]\u201d is a further confirmation of this promise of confidentiality. The fact that the defendant knew of the allegations of sexual assault against him, that he voluntarily traveled to the Nashua police station, and that his mother likely knew of the assault allegations does not change the plain meaning of the detective\u2019s statement.", "Moreover, the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality here is almost identical to the promise of confidentiality made in McDermott. See McDermott, 131 N.H. at 497-99. In McDermott, the agent promised \u201cthat the information [the defendant] provided would not leave the office,\u201d id. at 499 (quotation omitted), just as here the detective promised, \u201c[w]hat you tell me . . . can stay between me and you.\u201d The State attempts to distinguish McDermott, arguing that the detective here never implied or told \u201cthe defendant that his statements would not be used against him criminally,\u201d as did the agent in McDermott. See id. at 499. To the contrary, however, that is the exact implication of the detective\u2019s statement that \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.\u201d Indeed, the detective followed up this promise with the statement, \u201cThis is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. It\u2019s all done. It\u2019s behind him. You know? Get a little counseling and, and it\u2019s over,\u201d further indicating that the defendant would not be prosecuted criminally and only required counseling. The detective\u2019s warning two hours earlier that \u201c[a]nything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d fulfilling the Miranda requirements, did not vitiate the detective\u2019s later promise of confidentiality. The trial court erred in finding that the detective\u2019s statement was not a promise of confidentiality. See McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501.", "The State contends that even if the detective made a promise of confidentiality, the defendant did not rely upon it; therefore, his confession was voluntary. For a confession to be involuntary, we have stated that an interrogator\u2019s promise must induce or cause the defendant to confess. State v. Carroll, 138 N.H. 687, 693 (1994); see McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501 (noting that a confession made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary). Here, the trial court found that \u201cthere is no indication that the defendant\u2019s decision to confess was based upon [the detective\u2019s] statements\u201d because, in part, the defendant did not confess \u201cimmediately after\u201d the detective\u2019s statements.", "The trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant did not rely upon the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Within ten minutes of the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality, the defendant admitted to the sexual assault of C.P. and then A.P. He had not made a single inculpatory statement during the previous two hours of the interview. Further, the majority of the intervening time is occupied by the detective talking and making statements such as, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear bull . . . t. You know what, I, I don\u2019t. I, cause to be honest, if you bull . . . t me, then I may change my impression of you and I may change my view of what happened, OK?\u201d", "This case is distinguishable from Carroll. In Carroll, the defendant was interviewed by a police officer and under pointed questioning admitted to stabbing the pregnant wife of one of his co-conspirators for payment. Carroll, 138 N.H. at 689, 693. After these admissions, the defendant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to prison,\u201d to which the officer replied, \u201cThen tell us the truth.\u201d Id. at 692 (quotation omitted). The defendant then made further admissions. Id. We held that the officer\u2019s statement did not induce the defendant\u2019s confession; he had already confessed to several criminal acts and the same factors that motivated his earlier admissions, particularly his mother\u2019s exhortations, induced his later admissions. Id. at 693. In contrast, here the defendant did not confess until after the detective\u2019s promise of confidentiality. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s confession here was not motivated by other factors, such as a private actor exhorting him to tell the truth or overwhelming physical evidence of his guilt. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Guarno, 819 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir. 1987) (defendant confessed because overwhelmed by evidence police had amassed). The trial court erred in finding that the officer\u2019s statements did not induce the defendant to confess.", "Because the interviewing detective made a promise of confidentiality that the defendant relied upon, we hold that the defendant\u2019s resulting statement was involuntary. See McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501. The trial court\u2019s contrary determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence as viewed in the light most favorable to the State. In light of our ruling that the defendant\u2019s confessions were involuntary under the State Constitution, we need not address his arguments under the Federal Constitution. See Ball, 124 N.H. at 231-33.", "The defendant next argues that, during the trial for the alleged assaults of C.P., the trial court erred in permitting the State to ask the defendant, during cross-examination, if the complainant was \u201clying.\u201d See State v. Lopez, 156 N.H. 416, 423-24 (2007). At trial, the defendant took the stand and testified that he did not commit the alleged assaults. The following exchange occurred:", "Q.", "You heard [C.P.] testify today, right?", "A.", "Yes, I did.", "Q.", "Did you commit these crimes?", "A.", "No, I did not. Later, on cross-examination, the State asked, \u201cAnd so today when your son, [C.P.], testified that [the defendant] made me put his penis in my mouth, he was lying? Yes or no?\u201d Before the defendant could answer, his counsel objected, arguing that the question inadmissibly forced the defendant to opine on the credibility of another witness. The trial court overruled the objection, and required the defendant to answer. The prosecutor then renewed his question and the defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d", "We agree that these questions violated Lopez\u2019s \u201cbroad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses.\u201d Lopez, 156 N.H. at 424 (rejecting a case-by-case approach in favor of a broad prohibition). In Lopez, we found that the trial court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to ask the defendant \u201cwhether other witnesses had lied to the jury,\u201d id. at 423, just as the court erred here in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant whether his son had lied. We reasoned that \u201csuch questioning interferes with the jury\u2019s obligation to determine the credibility of witnesses, and is not probative in that it requires a witness to testify to things outside of her or his knowledge.\u201d Id. We, therefore, held that \u201cpermitting the prosecutor to ask the defendant to opine upon the credibility of other witnesses [is] error.\u201d Id. at 424.", "The State invites us to limit Lopez by creating an exception when a defendant has opened the door by testifying about the veracity of another witness on direct examination. See, e.g., Daniel v. State, 78 P.3d 890, 904 (Nev. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1045 (2004). The State contends that \u201ca defendant is not prejudiced by a question\u201d about another witness\u2019s credibility \u201c[w]here, as here, the entire defense, including the direct examination of the defendant, is built upon the affirmative accusation that a victim-witness is lying.\u201d A minority of six states have adopted this exception. See, e.g., State v. Pilot, 595 N.W.2d 511, 518 (Minn. 1999) (approving questions as to whether a witness was lying where \u201cthe focus of the defense was that the state\u2019s witnesses were lying and that the evidence against him was fabricated as part of a vast conspiracy to convict him of a crime he did not commit\u201d). We, however, decline the State\u2019s invitation to join them. As we stated in Lopez, \u201cwe are persuaded by the majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue that rather than a case-by-case approach, a broad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses is the better law.\u201d Lopez, 156 N.H. at 423-24.", "Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant to comment upon the credibility of another witness. The State asserts this error was harmless. Because we reverse and remand based upon the improperly admitted confession, we need not engage in further analysis.", "Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court at his first trial erred in denying a mistrial after the jury heard testimony that should have been redacted and erred at the second trial in finding A.P. competent to testify. In light of our reversal on other grounds, we need not address these issues.", "Reversed and remanded.", "BRODERICK, C.J., and DALIANIS, DUGGAN and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

The defendant, Katherine Mendola, was convicted by a jury of criminal solicitation to commit murder, see RSA 629:2 (2007); RSA 630:1 (2007). On appeal, she argues that the Superior Court (Nadeau, J.) erred when it failed to instruct the jury on entrapment, excluded evidence that her sometimes boyfriend had abused her, and admitted evidence that she wanted two additional people to be killed. We affirm.", "The jury could have found the following facts. The woman the defendant sought to have killed was the wife of her workers\u2019 compensation lawyer. She first hired this attorney in late 2004 or early 2005. Over time, she developed romantic feelings for him, which she expressed by calling him repeatedly and by saying inappropriate things to him, such as referring to her cleavage, describing herself as \u201cyoung,\u201d \u201chot,\u201d and \u201csexy,\u201d and telling him that she would make \u201cthe best wife in the whole wide world.\u201d Between September 1 and November 1, 2007, the defendant called her attorney 458 times. In one of her many visits to his office, the defendant embraced him and told him that she wanted to have a romantic relationship with him. Although he demurred, the defendant told others that they had kissed.", "The defendant talked about her attorney to her friends \u201call the time,\u201d telling them that she loved him and wanted to marry him. She said that her attorney yearned to be with her, but that he did not want to disrupt his marriage. The defendant then sought to break up her attorney\u2019s marriage. At first, she tried magic spells that she ordered from witchcraft websites. When these did not work, she sought to hire someone to kill her attorney\u2019s wife.", "She first asked T. Thomas Austin, who lived at the same campground as the defendant. In the summer of 2007, she twice asked Austin to \u201celiminate\u201d her attorney\u2019s wife because she was in love with her attorney and wanted to marry him. Austin declined. She then asked Daniel Cloutier, with whom she sometimes lived, if he knew of someone who could do the job. Although Cloutier initially did not take the defendant seriously, he became concerned that she might be capable of hurting someone when she threatened him with a knife because he left a mess in the bathroom.", "Cloutier contacted agents from the drug task force for the New Hampshire Attorney General in October 2007. Ten years earlier, he had been an informant for the task force for approximately one year. Cloutier told two task force agents that he had a roommate who wanted to hire an assassin to kill the wife of a man with whom she was having an affair. The agents spoke with the state police, and, as a result, State Trooper Christopher Huse was assigned to pose as a hit man. Huse first met with Cloutier, who told him that the defendant was his roommate and that she wanted a hit man to kill her attorney\u2019s wife. Huse told Cloutier to tell the defendant that he knew someone who would contact her about the job. The defendant seemed \u201coverjoyed\u201d when Cloutier told her this.", "On November 16, 2007, Huse called the defendant, posing as a hit man, and asked if she were still interested in his services, to which she said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d When the defendant told Huse that she\u2019d rather talk in person, he told her that they would meet in New Hampshire and that he would call her when he was \u201cready.\u201d Huse told the defendant that \u201cbusiness is gonna be taken care of,\u201d to which she said, \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d and laughed.", "Huse called the defendant again on November 19, 2007.

The defendant told Huse that she thought this was \u201cfunny\u201d because \u201c[t]he name of [the wife] is Wendy.\u201d The defendant told Huse that she\u2019d \u201cbeen waiting for this for five years.\u201d When Huse asked why she had not hired him earlier, she said: \u201cI just found out about you . . . . If I had known about you a year ago, . . .

That this first payment of the thousand dollars to kill her isn\u2019t just the only payment; there\u2019s going to be more.\u201d The defendant agreed.", "Huse asked the defendant whether there was \u201c[a]nything specific that [she] want[ed],\u201d to which she replied: \u201cI want her dead and I want it to look like an accident . . . . \u201d She explained that her attorney\u2019s wife \u201cneeds to die. . . . She can\u2019t be like hurt or injured or like in a hospital.

[a]nd then you got to shoot her.\u201d When Huse asked whether the defendant wanted the woman to be shot in the chest or the head, the defendant said: \u201cThe head\u2019s the best because . . . . [p]eople rarely survive head shot gun wounds. . . . We want her gone, so do it in the head, if you can.\u201d", "The defendant then expressed her concern that, because she called her attorney\u2019s office \u201call the time\u201d and wrote love letters to him, she could be a suspect in his wife\u2019s death. She explained that she hoped that Huse would tell her \u201cwhen this is going to take place\u201d so that she could \u201chop on a plane and go down to Florida and disappear for [a] while.\u201d", "After the defendant met with Huse, she returned to her home and told Cloutier, excitedly, \u201c[I]t\u2019s definitely going down.\u201d Some days later, Huse called the defendant and asked her to meet him so that she could identify her attorney\u2019s wife in a photo that he had obtained. Huse and the defendant agreed to meet in Milford, where the police arrested her.", "At trial, defense counsel told the jury in his opening statement that this case was about \u201cthe control carefully, methodically and purposely\u201d wielded over the defendant by Cloutier. The defendant\u2019s theory of the case, as explained in defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, was that Cloutier physically, verbally and sexually abused her for many years, and then, because he wanted to be rid of her, set her up to be arrested for solicitation of murder. \u201cComply or die,\u201d is what defense counsel said Cloutier told the defendant. But for Cloutier\u2019s \u201cabuse, . . . threats and . . . manipulati[on],\u201d the defendant \u201cwould not have stepped into [Huse\u2019s] truck.\u201d As defense counsel explained, the defendant \u201cwas not predisposed to do this. She only did it because she was forced to comply or die.\u201d Consistent with this theory, the defendant testified that Cloutier told her that he would kill her if she did not do as he said. She testified that Cloutier told her that he wanted to be rid of her and \u201cwas going to be an informant and set [her] up with the drug task force.\u201d", "The defendant first argues that the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on entrapment.

To prevail, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. State v. Duran, 158 N.H. 146, 150 (2008). We will search the record for evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction. State v. Balliro, 158 N.H. 1, 5 (2008).", "For a defendant to be entitled to an instruction on a specific defense, there must be some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense.

To be entitled to an instruction on this defense, a defendant must point to \u201csome evidence\u201d that: (1) law enforcement officials induced or encouraged the defendant to commit the offense; and (2) the defendant was not predisposed to engage in it. State v. Larose, 157 N.H. 28, 35 (2008).", "We begin by addressing the first prong of the defense -- inducement. Inducement is something more than \u201cmerely affording a person an opportunity to commit an offense.\u201d RSA 626:5; see Larose, 157 N.H. at 35. Rather, \u201c[a]n inducement consists of an \u2018opportunity\u2019 plus something else \u2013 typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government\u2019s taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.\u201d Larose, 157 N.H. at 36 (quotation omitted).", "Here, even if we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, we fail to find \u201csome evidence\u201d that would support a rational finding that the defendant was induced by law enforcement to commit the charged offense. There was no evidence that Huse did anything other than offer his services to the defendant. \u201cAn inducement, by its very nature, contemplates more than a request and an affirmative response.\u201d Id. at 35 (quotation omitted). \u201cIt is more than a solicitation.

See Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 373-74 (1958); RSA 626:5. At most, Cloutier acted as a government agent when, at Huse\u2019s direction, he told the defendant that he had talked with a hitman from whom she should expect a call. The only evidence that, during this specific period of time, Cloutier in any way threatened the defendant came from her own self-serving account. The defendant failed to produce any corroborating evidence about the abuse. The defendant\u2019s testimony, standing alone, does not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d to support her requested instruction. See Larose, 157 N.H. at 33. A court need not give weight to allegations that are intrinsically improbable or flatly contradicted by irrefutable evidence. Id. Moreover, conclusory and self-serving statements, standing alone, do not suffice. Id. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s account, although self-serving, may have weight if it is interlaced with considerable detail and has some circumstantial corroboration in the record.\u201d Id.

See id. at 38.", "The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce evidence that she would \u201clove\u201d to hire Huse in the future to kill two other people: her biological father and another woman whom she disliked. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b).", "Although the State argues that the defendant failed to preserve this argument for our review because her motion in limine cited Rule 404(a), instead of Rule 404(b), we disagree.

While the defendant contends that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce the challenged evidence during its case-in-chief before the defendant could present sufficient evidence of her entrapment defense, we agree with the State that this argument is not preserved for our review, and decline to address it.", "The contested evidence was also relevant to show that the defendant possessed the required criminal intent for criminal solicitation, which is that she acted purposely. RSA 629:2, I. \u201cA person acts purposely . . . when [her] conscious object is to cause the result or engage in the conduct that comprises\u201d the offense. RSA 626:2, II(a) (2007). Evidence that the defendant sought to hire Huse to kill other people tended to show that when she hired Huse to kill her attorney\u2019s wife, she did so with the purpose of having her attorney\u2019s wife killed. This evidence showed that she did not solicit Huse to kill her attorney\u2019s wife only because, as she claimed, Cloutier forced her to do so, but because she personally wanted the wife to be killed, just as she wanted two other people whom she disliked to be killed.", "Under the third prong, evidence of other bad acts is admissible if the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Beltran, 153 N.H. at 649. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, or provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision upon something other than the established propositions in the case. Id. It is not, however, evidence that is merely detrimental to the defendant because it tends to prove guilt. Id. We accord considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s determination in balancing prejudice and probative worth under Rule 404(b). Id. To prevail, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. Id.", "Here, in light of the defendant\u2019s entrapment defense and her theory that, but for Cloutier\u2019s abuse and threats, she lacked the requisite criminal intent to commit the charged crime, we cannot say that the trial court unreasonably balanced the prejudicial effect and probative worth of evidence that the defendant asked Huse to kill people other than her attorney\u2019s wife. In the context of this case, this evidence was highly probative both because it rebutted the defendant\u2019s entrapment defense and because it established that she, in fact, had the requisite criminal intent. Even though the evidence was prejudicial, the defendant has not shown that the trial court erred in concluding that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.", "Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court erred when it precluded her from introducing evidence that Cloutier abused her. We defer to the trial court in determining the admissibility of evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. State v. Dodds, 159 N.H. 239, 250 (2009). We will not reverse its decision unless the defendant demonstrates that it was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. Id. at 251. The record reveals that the trial court, in fact, allowed the defendant to testify, at length, about Cloutier\u2019s alleged abuse. While the trial court precluded the defendant from presenting witnesses to testify that she told them that Cloutier abused her, the defendant has failed to show that this decision was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. We decline to address the defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s decision violated her constitutional right to present all proofs favorable, see N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST. amend. VI, because she did not brief this argument sufficiently for our review. See State v.

He argues that the Trial Court (Nadeau, J.) erred when it denied his motion to suppress testimony from a jailhouse informant and when it denied his request for a jury instruction on the credibility of informant testimony. We affirm.", "In September 2003, John Brooks loaded two motorcycles into a trailer in order to move them from a storage facility in Manchester. The next day, Brooks discovered that the trailer had been stolen and suspected that Jack Reid, a handyman he had hired to help him pack, had committed the theft. In 2005, Brooks planned to kill Reid. He recruited Michael Benton, Joseph Vrooman, and the defendant to assist him.", "Brooks\u2019s plan involved luring Reid to a farmhouse in Deerfield, where Brooks would question Reid about the stolen items and one of the four men would smother Reid to death with Saran Wrap. The job of luring Reid to the farmhouse fell to the defendant. The defendant made a series of phone calls to Reid, and set up a date and a time for Reid to come to the farmhouse. To ensure that Reid would come alone, the defendant told him that he was going through a divorce and needed to save money on labor.", "In preparation for the confrontation with Reid, the defendant, Brooks, and Vrooman bought zipties, a tarp, gloves, trash bags, and duct tape. The defendant discussed how to kill Reid and suggested using Saran Wrap to smother him. The defendant also discussed plans for disposing of Reid\u2019s body after he was killed, and later drove around on the day of the murder looking for places to dump Reid\u2019s body.", "On June 27, 2005, Reid arrived alone at the farmhouse in Deerfield. The defendant and Vrooman led him into the farmhouse and down a corridor, toward a closet where Benton was waiting. When Reid reached the end of the corridor, Vrooman pushed Reid into the closet toward Benton. Vrooman then tackled Reid to prevent him from escaping and Benton began beating Reid in the head with a sledgehammer. When Benton stopped the beating and began to walk away, the defendant and Vrooman noticed that Reid was still breathing and instructed Benton to return. Benton went back into the closet and again hit Reid in the head with the sledgehammer.", "Reid\u2019s body was dragged to the center of the barn and the defendant and Vrooman attempted to contain the bleeding. The defendant handed Saran Wrap to Vrooman, who then attempted to wrap it around Reid\u2019s head. When this failed to contain the blood, the defendant gave Vrooman a plastic tarp to wrap around Reid\u2019s head. Reid was still bleeding, so Brooks struck Reid in the chest with the sledgehammer several times, finally killing him, stating \u201cstop the heart, stop the bleeding.\u201d", "The four men then wrapped Reid\u2019s body in plastic and duct tape and put his body in the back of Reid\u2019s pickup truck. The men covered Reid\u2019s body with rocks and brush. The defendant and Vrooman drove Reid\u2019s truck with the body in the bed of the truck to Massachusetts, while Brooks and Benton followed in Brooks\u2019s minivan. The defendant navigated a route to avoid tolls so as to avoid detection. Once in Massachusetts, the defendant and Vrooman agreed to leave the truck and the body in a Target parking lot in Saugus.", "In the days following the killing, the defendant, Brooks, and Vrooman returned to the farmhouse to clean up evidence of the murder. The defendant and Vrooman ripped out and replaced the walls and flooring of the closet where Reid was attacked. The men took the wood that they had ripped out to Bert Seaver\u2019s home to put in his burn pile. The men also briefly considered moving Reid\u2019s body from the Target parking lot, but had disposed of the truck\u2019s keys and did not want to risk \u201chotwiring\u201d the truck in broad daylight where cameras might be present.", "Following the murder and clean up, the defendant, Brooks, and Vrooman flew to Las Vegas. On July 5, 2005, Reid\u2019s body was found in the bed of his pickup truck. Phone records, surveillance video from the Target parking lot, and evidence found in the pickup truck led the police to Benton, Brooks, Vrooman and the defendant. The defendant was arrested on November 14, 2006.", "While the defendant was at the Rockingham County House of Correction, he met Henry Bellemare, another inmate. The defendant had numerous conversations with Bellemare during which he made several incriminating statements regarding Reid\u2019s murder. New Hampshire State Police Detective Robert Estabrook subsequently met with Bellemare at the jail to confirm that he was willing to cooperate with the defendant\u2019s prosecution, and conducted a full interview with him at the state police barracks on June 26, 2007.", "On May 4, 2009, the day before the first day of jury selection, the defendant filed a motion to suppress Bellemare\u2019s testimony, arguing that Bellemare was an agent of the State when he was speaking with the defendant and thus the State violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel. A hearing on the motion was held the day before the trial was scheduled to begin. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion as untimely and allowed Bellemare to testify.", "On appeal the defendant makes two arguments. First, he contends that he had \u201cgood cause\u201d for his late filing of the motion to suppress and that the trial court\u2019s remedy of summarily denying the motion was too extreme a sanction. Second, he argues that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in denying his request for a jury instruction on the credibility of informant testimony.", "With respect to his first issue, the defendant argues that he was not aware of the possible constitutional issues regarding Bellemare until after Bellemare was deposed on May 1, 2009. The State counters that the defendant was provided with details of interviews conducted with Bellemare more than a year before the motion to suppress was filed, as well as letters from attorneys representing both Bellemare and the State, and thus he was provided with more than enough notice of any potential suppression issues.", "Parties must file motions to suppress \u201cnot less than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the scheduled jury selection date or within such other time in advance of trial as the Court may order for good cause shown or may provide for in a pretrial scheduling order.\u201d Super. Ct. R. 98(F). Here, the trial court set a deadline of March 2, 2009, for all dispositive motions and all motions other than motions in limine.

Cromlish, 146 N.H. 277 (2001), we upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for services other than counsel filed on the eve of trial. There, we noted that", "[a]ny further delay would have required the court to repeat the", "work necessary to call up and choose another jury as well as", "adjust its calendar to accommodate the continuance.", "Furthermore, a continuance on the eve of trial would have required", "the State and local law enforcement authorities to commit", "additional resources to repeat trial preparation at a later date.", "Additionally, the burden on these resources if such last minute", "continuances were routinely granted would hamper the State\u2019s", "overall ability to pursue the orderly administration of justice. Id. at 282.", "In this case, the trial court determined that the defendant received taped interviews between Bellemare and Sergeant Estabrook that included details of the conversations between the defendant and Bellemare. In addition to the taped interviews, the trial court found that the defendant received reports about two other interviews with Bellemare as well as letters from attorneys representing Bellemare and the State \u201cspecifically flagging the Sixth Amendment potential issue.\u201d The trial court determined that the defendant had more than enough discovery to file a motion to suppress before the deadline set by the scheduling order.", "Moreover, the motion was filed more than two months after the deadline set by the scheduling order and was not heard until the day before the trial was to commence. The trial judge is in the best position to determine what is required to ensure the orderly administration of justice. In this case, the judge found that the defendant did not show good cause for the delay, and, because of the impending trial, properly exercised discretion in denying the suppression motion. See Cromlish, 146 N.H. at 282.", "The defendant next argues that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by refusing his request for a special jury instruction regarding Bellemare\u2019s credibility. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request, finding that a specific instruction would constitute an improper comment about the evidence.", "\u201cWhether or not a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of the instruction, is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d State v. Kousounadis, 159 N.H. 413, 422-23 (2009) (quotation omitted).

The trial judge chose to give a general credibility instruction, providing a number of factors for jurors to consider when assessing the weight of each witness\u2019s testimony. In addition, the court gave an instruction highlighting the need for jurors to scrutinize those witnesses cooperating with the State and their possible ulterior motives. We cannot say that the choice to give the general credibility instruction, which highlighted certain specific factors for jurors to consider, rather than the defendant\u2019s requested informant instruction, was \u201cbeyond the range of options from which one would expect a trial judge to select in such a situation.\u201d Id. at 256 (Ripple, J., concurring).", "Affirmed.", "DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

He argues that the Superior Court (Arnold, J.) erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence derived from a search warrant issued by the Keene District Court, which authorized a search for information held by an out-of-state corporation. We affirm.", "The record supports the following facts. As an aid to the investigation of crimes related to the sexual exploitation of children, Detective James McLaughlin of the Keene Police Department placed a profile on an Internet social networking site. The profile indicated that he was a fourteen-year-old boy and included a photograph of a boy who was approximately that age. In October 2008, the defendant added McLaughlin\u2019s fictitious profile to his friend list on the social networking site. The defendant\u2019s profile on the site included several photographs of nude male children, some of which were pornographic in nature. McLaughlin and the defendant subsequently engaged in several e- mail and real-time chat exchanges between October 12 and October 15. Many of these exchanges were sexually explicit in nature and the defendant sent numerous pornographic images depicting male children to McLaughlin by e- mail and real-time chat.", "Using the defendant\u2019s e-mail address, \u201cwildbill0911,\u201d McLaughlin determined the defendant\u2019s corresponding Internet Protocol (IP) address. McLaughlin\u2019s check of the IP address also identified the subscriber\u2019s location as Nashua and his Internet service provider as Comcast, a New Jersey based corporation. On October 20, 2008, McLaughlin obtained a search warrant authorizing a search for subscriber information associated with the defendant\u2019s IP address. The warrant stated that Comcast was in possession of that information. The Keene District Court issued the warrant and McLaughlin faxed it to Comcast. Comcast responded by faxed letter and provided the subscriber\u2019s name, address, telephone number, type of service, account number, account status, IP assignment, e-mail user IDs, and method of payment.", "Based upon this information, McLaughlin applied for and received an additional warrant to search the defendant\u2019s home for certain computer-related equipment. McLaughlin and the Nashua Police Department executed the warrant and seized evidence that led to the indictment of the defendant on four counts of delivery of child pornography.", "The defendant subsequently filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the initial search warrant. He contended that the district court exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction by issuing a warrant for evidence held by an out-of-state corporation. The trial court denied the motion because the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information obtained from Comcast.", "On appeal, the defendant argues that the warrant to obtain his subscriber information was issued in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under our State Constitution and cite federal cases for guidance only. State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). We review the superior court\u2019s order on a motion to suppress de novo, except as to any controlling facts determined by the superior court in the first instance. State v. Goss, 150 N.H. 46, 47 (2003).", "The defendant contends that the district court did not have the authority to issue a search warrant to a corporation outside of New Hampshire. At oral argument, the State conceded that the search warrant was defective. We agree that the district court did not have jurisdiction to issue a warrant to an out-of- state corporation. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to outline some of the proper procedures for obtaining records and evidence located outside of New Hampshire.", "For example, the legislature has provided two mechanisms for obtaining such evidence, neither of which was followed in this case. See RSA 7:6-b (2003); RSA ch. 613 (2001). The first method pertains only to records held by a \u201ccommunications common carrier,\u201d see RSA 7:6-b, defined as \u201ca person engaged in providing communications services to the general public through transmission of any form of information between subscribers by means of wire, cable, radio or electromagnetic transmission, optical or fiber-optic transmission, or other means which transfers information without physical transfer of medium.\u201d RSA 570-A:1, IX (2001). Upon written demand of the attorney general, or his designee, that he \u201chas reasonable grounds for belief that the service furnished to a person or to a location by such communications common carrier has been, is being, or may be used for an unlawful purpose,\u201d the carrier must provide certain identifying information, including the name and address of the subscriber. RSA 7:6-b, I, III.", "Alternatively, RSA chapter 613 provides a uniform method, which has been adopted by all fifty states and the District of Columbia, for requesting the appearance of an out-of-state witness in New Hampshire. This uniform statute provides that a New Hampshire court may summons a material out-of-state witness in any grand jury investigation or criminal prosecution that has commenced or is about to commence by issuing a certificate under the seal of the court requesting the presence of that witness. RSA 613:3, I. That certificate must then be presented to a court in the county in which the witness is found. Id. Thus, in this case, the State could have requested a New Hampshire court to summons Comcast\u2019s keeper of records to New Hampshire. We also note that these two examples do not foreclose the possibility that there may be other permissible means for obtaining evidence from an out-of-state corporation.", "Nonetheless, the defective warrant infringed upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights only if the effort to obtain evidence constituted a search in the constitutional sense. See State v. Valenzuela, 130 N.H. 175, 181-82 (1987). The defendant asserts that a search took place because he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the subscriber information that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The State argues that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because he voluntarily conveyed the information to Comcast.", "\u201cOur State Constitution protects all people, their papers, their possessions and their homes from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Goss, 150 N.H. at 48 (quotation omitted). We have recognized that an expectation of privacy plays a role in the protection afforded under Part I, Article 19. State v. Robinson, 158 N.H. 792, 796 (2009). In Goss, we adopted a two-part analysis for determining whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy: \u201cfirst, that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d Goss, 150 N.H. at 49 (quotations omitted).", "The State does not dispute that the defendant had a subjective expectation of privacy in his subscriber information. Accordingly, we need only decide whether the defendant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy was one that society would be prepared to recognize as reasonable.", "We have previously held that a defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in business records containing information voluntarily provided to a public utility. State v. Gubitosi, 152 N.H. 673, 677-79 (2005); Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 183; see also Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-45 (1979). In Valenzuela, we relied upon a series of United States Supreme Court \u201cagent- informer\u201d cases and determined that the government\u2019s use of a pen register to record outgoing telephone numbers dialed by the defendant was not a search within the meaning of Article 19. Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 188-89. These \u201cagent-informer\u201d cases have consistently held that information revealed by a defendant to a government informant or agent is admissible even if the informant or agent conceals his true identity. Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302 (1966); Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206, 210-11 (1966); United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 752 (1971). We explained in Valenzuela that in making a record of a decoded signal sent from the defendant\u2019s phone to the telephone company, \u201cthe registers did no more than record voluntary communications from the defendant to the telephone company.\u201d Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 183. We also specifically distinguished these communications to the company from the contents of communications transmitted over the company\u2019s lines, addressed to recipients of completed calls. Id.", "We confronted a similar issue more recently in Gubitosi, where we specifically declined the defendant\u2019s invitation to overrule Valenzuela. Gubitosi, 152 N.H. at 678. There, we determined that just as a defendant has no protected privacy interest in a record of his outgoing phone calls, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in a record of a defendant\u2019s cell phone calls \u201crecorded for billing purposes and retained by [the telephone company] in the ordinary course of its business.\u201d Id. at 677-78.", "Likewise, we see no meaningful distinction between obtaining telephone numbers recorded in the ordinary course of business by a telephone company and the procurement of a customer\u2019s basic subscriber information from an Internet service provider. As in Valenzuela and Gubitosi, the defendant voluntarily provided the information to Comcast, which recorded it in the ordinary course of business for billing purposes and used it to provide the defendant with Internet service. Having voluntarily provided this information in order to use Comcast\u2019s service, the defendant cannot now claim a privacy interest in it. See Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 188 (explaining that once a defendant voluntarily discloses information to another he cannot claim a degree of privacy protection against the government because it would result in \u201ca kind of evidentiary copyright\u201d). Accordingly, we join the overwhelming majority of federal and state courts that have addressed this issue and conclude that a defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in subscriber information voluntarily provided to an Internet service provider. See, e.g., United States v. Perrine, 518 F.3d 1196, 1204 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 440 (2010); Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 336 (6th Cir. 2001); United States v.

App. 2002).", "Our conclusion is bolstered by Comcast\u2019s customer privacy policy, which specifically reserves the right to disclose subscriber information to \u201ccomply with law.\u201d The defendant contends that this exception to the privacy policy is inapplicable because Comcast responded to a defective warrant.

Goss, 150 N.H. at 49-50. He contends that Goss stands for the proposition \u201cthat by exposing information to a third party, when one does not expect it to be revealed to anyone else in the ordinary course, that one does not lose an expectation of privacy in that information.\u201d", "The defendant reads Goss too broadly. While the defendant correctly points out that we construed our State Constitution to provide greater protection than the Federal Constitution, we explicitly relied upon the fact that people do not voluntarily expose the contents of their sealed trash bags to the public when they leave those bags out for regular collection. Goss, 150 N.H. at 49. Additionally, in Gubitosi, we rejected the defendant\u2019s similar reliance upon Goss to contend that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephone billing records because they \u201conly contain information that he voluntarily conveyed to [the phone company] in order to make use of its telephone service.\u201d Gubitosi, 152 N.H. at 679. Likewise, as we have already determined, the defendant here voluntarily provided his subscriber information to Comcast, and in doing so, lost any reasonable expectation of privacy in that information. Accordingly, Goss is distinguishable from the facts of this case.", "The defendant also points us to the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Reid, 945 A.2d 26 (N.J. 2008), which, contrary to the majority of jurisdictions, recognized a reasonable expectation of privacy in Internet subscriber information. Reid, 945 A.2d at 33-34. The court in Reid began its analysis by recognizing that federal courts, relying upon \u201csettled federal law that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information exposed to third parties, like a telephone company or bank,\u201d have found no expectation of privacy in Internet subscriber information. Id. at 31. Nonetheless, the court reached a different conclusion based upon its own case law, which recognizes a reasonable expectation of privacy in telephone billing and bank records. Id. at 32.", "Despite our previous reliance upon \u201csettled federal law\u201d recognizing no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily exposed to third parties, the defendant urges us to adopt the reasoning of Reid. He contends that our State Constitution, like New Jersey\u2019s State Constitution, provides greater privacy protection than the Federal Constitution. While Part I, Article 19 does offer greater protection than the Fourth Amendment in some circumstances, see Goss, 150 N.H. at 49; State v. Sterndale, 139 N.H. 445, 449 (1995) (refusing to adopt an automobile exception to the warrant requirement), our law regarding information voluntarily exposed to third parties is in line with the protection afforded under the Fourth Amendment and diverges significantly from New Jersey law, see Valenzuela, 130 N.H. at 182-84 (relying upon the \u201cwell-settled\u201d and \u201cinescapable\u201d United States Supreme Court precedent that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily exposed to third parties); Gubitosi, 152 N.H. at 677 (noting that we relied upon Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), in Valenzuela to determine that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in phone numbers dialed to make outgoing calls). Accordingly, we do not find Reid persuasive and decline to follow it.", "We recognize how intertwined and essential computers and the Internet have become to everyday, modern life.

We are also cognizant that many users conduct some of their most private affairs over the Internet because of the anonymity that it offers. Nonetheless, as we similarly recognized in Valenzuela more than twenty years ago, while individuals may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their communications, i.e., the content of e-mails and the specific content viewed over the Internet, they have no such privacy interest in information voluntarily disclosed to an Internet service provider in order to gain access to the Internet.

On the previous day, a man named Bill threatened Roney White\u2019s young cousins with a knife at a 7-Eleven store close to Roney\u2019s home. When Roney learned of the incident from his cousins, he directed them to identify the man with the knife. Finding Bill standing outside the store, Roney punched him in the face in retaliation and fled the scene. Later that night, apparently in response to Roney\u2019s actions, Kar and his friends drove past a small group of people standing on the street, which included Roney, his brother Roscoe White, and their friend Anthony Clagon, and unsuccessfully attempted to hit one of them with a stick from the moving vehicle. No further encounter between the two groups occurred that night.", "The next day, at around 2:30 p.m., Bill and another person attacked Roney with a baseball bat as he was walking alone on Nashua Street. Badly injured, Roney stumbled home to his mother and two brothers, Roscoe and Raymond Alleyene. Roney\u2019s mother took him to the hospital. Shortly thereafter, Alleyene, Clagon, and Roscoe met at Roscoe\u2019s house and discussed the possibility of an armed fight in retaliation for the attack on Roney. After Roscoe failed to get his own gun to work, he called some friends in Nashua, asking them to bring a gun.", "That evening, the defendant, his brother Sergio, Andrew Gonzalez, and Clagon\u2019s cousin Kim and her children drove from Nashua to Manchester in a red Chevrolet Blazer. The men met Clagon, Alleyene, and Roscoe in the room Roscoe shared with Roney, smoked marijuana, and settled on a plan to find Roney\u2019s attackers and confront them. After Roscoe confirmed that the defendant had brought a gun, the six men set out in the Blazer to find Roney\u2019s attackers. A short time later, they found a group of people whom they suspected had been involved in Roney\u2019s attack gathered near a dumpster. After driving past the group once or twice, they parked the Blazer around the corner and discussed who would do the shooting. They settled on Roscoe as the shooter based on his blood relationship with Roney. The defendant then wiped the gun with his shirt, racked the slide to cock it, and handed it to Roscoe. Roscoe left with a mask on, shot Kar in the leg and abdomen, returned to the Blazer, and the men drove away. Kar later died from his wounds.", "The jury convicted the defendant of first-degree murder based on his role as an accomplice in Kar\u2019s death.

Under the common-law rule, to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter, the provocation must be so severe or extreme as to provoke a reasonable person to kill another person out of passion.1 State v. Smith, 123 N.H. 46, 48 (1983). Even if a reasonable person would have committed the act, still the defendant must have been actually provoked. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 15.2(c), at 506 (2d ed. 2003). And even a defendant so provoked will not be entitled to a manslaughter instruction where the time elapsing between the provocation and the killing is such that a reasonable person would have cooled. Id. \u00a7 15.2(d), at 507. \u201c[I]f, from any circumstances whatever, it appears that the party reflected, deliberated, or 1", "Most modern formulations of the common-law \u201cheat of passion\u201d doctrine measure both the adequacy of the provocation and the severity of the response by a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a715.2(b)(10), at 504 (2d ed. 2003). Unlike in the tort context, however, the reasonable person standard in the provocation context is not a standard of acceptable, non-blameworthy conduct; rather it is a fiction that stands for a centuries-old recognition that, in certain extreme circumstances, even an average person of ordinary disposition may suffer a temporary loss of reason and control. See id. at 495 (\u201c[T]he reasonable man, however greatly provoked he may be, does not kill.\u201d). Provocation manslaughter is, therefore, a \u201cconcession to human frailty,\u201d reflected in the fact that a person killing under an extreme mental or emotional disturbance in response to extreme provocation has committed a serious crime \u2013 manslaughter \u2013 but not as serious a crime as first or second-degree murder. cooled any period of time before the fatal stroke was given, or if in legal presumption there was time or opportunity for cooling, the killing will amount to murder, being attributable to malice and revenge, and not to mental disturbance.\u201d 40 Am. Jur. 2d Homicide \u00a7 60, at 648 (2008).", "Before applying these principles to the facts, we note that our case law has approached provocation manslaughter in two arguably inconsistent ways: as a lesser-included offense of murder, see State v. Little, 123 N.H. 433, 435 (1983), and as a \u201cdefense\u201d to murder, see State v. O\u2019Leary, 153 N.H. 710, 713- 14 (2006); State v. Taylor, 141 N.H. 89, 94-96 (1996). In contrast to our 1983 decision in Little, which referred to provocation manslaughter as a lesser- included offense of murder, see Little, 123 N.H. at 435-36, in Taylor we referred to provocation manslaughter as a defense to murder. See Taylor, 141 N.H. at 96. We approved of the jury instructions in Taylor because the trial court instructed the jury to consider provocation manslaughter alongside both first and second-degree murder, effectively treating provocation as a defense to both charges rather than as a lesser-included offense meriting the jury\u2019s attention only after the jury had fully deliberated on both the first-degree and second- degree murder charges. See id. Consistent with this holding, in O\u2019Leary, we concluded that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury to consider the \u201clesser-included offense\u201d of provocation manslaughter only after the jury had first acquitted the defendant of first and second-degree murder; despite this error, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction because we found the error harmless. See O\u2019Leary, 153 N.H. at 713-17.", "We have never treated provocation manslaughter under RSA 630:2, I(a) as a true \u201cdefense\u201d under the Criminal Code triggering the notice requirements of Superior Court Rules 98(B) and 101, and we decline to do so today. Rather, provocation is best understood as a \u201cpartial defense\u201d because, unlike traditional defenses that serve to discharge a defendant\u2019s liability for conduct that otherwise constitutes a crime, provocation manslaughter comprises a set of mitigating circumstances that can negate the mens rea required for intentional murder and, even where they do not have this negation effect, can warrant a jury in finding the defendant guilty of a separate, less culpable offense than murder under the Code. See Berman & Farrell, Provocation Manslaughter as Partial Justification and Partial Excuse, 52 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1027, 1045 (2011) (recognizing this widely-accepted approach). Unlike the defenses of insanity or self-defense, provocation under RSA 630:2, I(a) only reduces, but does not eliminate, the punishment for murder,2 based on what the law conceives as a lesser degree of culpability for acts done under the 2 In our statutes, a person convicted of first-degree murder must be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. RSA 630:1-a, III (2007). By contrast, a person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to no more than thirty years imprisonment. RSA 630:2, II (2007). influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance in response to extreme provocation.", "Although provocation is only a partial rather than a full defense, because it can operate both to reduce the mens rea required for murder and to provide a basis for the jury\u2019s invocation of the community\u2019s sense of compassion, we conclude that provocation, when properly raised, should be treated similarly to self-defense. Accordingly, to guide trial courts in the future, we advise that, in a murder prosecution, the State must prove the absence of provocation beyond a reasonable doubt when the defendant presents some evidence to support a rational finding that he caused the death at issue under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation. See Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 704 (1975). For example, in a first-degree murder prosecution under RSA 630:1-a, I(a), where a defendant presents evidence to support a rational finding of provocation manslaughter, juries should be instructed that to find the defendant guilty of first-degree murder the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the defendant caused the death of the victim; (2) that he acted \u201cpurposely\u201d under the special definition of that term in RSA 630:1-a, II;3 and (3) that he did not act under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation. The jury should also be given an acquittal first instruction indicating that, if the jury finds the defendant not guilty of first-degree murder pursuant to the foregoing instructions, it should next consider whether the State has proved, again beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements of second- degree murder under RSA 630:1-b, I(a): (1) that the defendant caused the death of the victim; (2) that he acted knowingly; and (3) that he did not act under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation. Once again, the jury should be given the acquittal first instruction and told that if it finds the defendant not guilty of second-degree murder, it should then go on to consider whether he is guilty of provocation manslaughter, the elements of this offense being: (1) that the defendant caused the death of the victim; and (2) that the defendant acted either purposely or knowingly. The jury should also be instructed that, if it reaches the crime of provocation manslaughter in its deliberations, the defendant may be found guilty of this crime if the State proves the foregoing two elements beyond a reasonable doubt even if the jury concludes that the defendant acted 3 The definition of \u201cpurposely\u201d found in the first-degree murder statute has two components: (1) that the defendant\u2019s conscious object was to cause the death of another; and (2) that the defendant\u2019s acts in furtherance of this object were deliberate and premeditated. See RSA 630:1-a, II (2007). This specific definition applicable to the first-degree murder offense proscribed by RSA 630:1-a, I(a) is different from the general definition of \u201cpurposely\u201d which applies to other crimes in the Criminal Code. See RSA 626:2, II(a) (2007). under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance caused by extreme provocation.4", "Turning now to the circumstances of the instant case, we conclude that the undisputed facts culminating in Kar\u2019s death reveal no evidence upon which a provocation instruction was warranted. At least two hours passed between the moment the defendant learned by telephone that Roney had been attacked and the moment the defendant and his friends found and killed Kar. In that time, the defendant located a loaded gun, drove with his friends from Nashua to Manchester, met with Roscoe and several others at Roscoe\u2019s home, smoked marijuana, and discussed how to avenge the attack on Roney. The drive to Manchester took about one-half hour and the discussion in Roney\u2019s home took at least an additional half-hour. Then, with the defendant\u2019s brother driving, they set out to find Roney\u2019s assailants on the street. When they found the men they were looking for, they drove past once or twice, parked around the corner, and discussed for about seven or eight minutes who would do the shooting. After the group settled on Roscoe as the shooter, the defendant pulled out a gun, wiped it off, cocked it, and gave it to Roscoe, telling him the gun was \u201csmooth.\u201d", "This sequence is not consistent with a sudden emotional disturbance from which the defendant had no time to regain control of his passions. Even assuming that Kar was the person with Bill during the attack on Roney the day before, and that such attack both actually and reasonably provoked the defendant, a reasonable person would not remain in that extreme emotional state after driving to a different city, meeting with several friends to discuss how to retaliate, taking the time to smoke marijuana, and again driving to search for one\u2019s provokers. The law is careful to distinguish a sudden rush of passion following extreme provocation, on the one hand, from a desire for revenge, on the other. See State v. Henson, 197 P.3d 456, 464 (Kan. 2008). A provocation manslaughter instruction is simply not appropriate where, as here, the defendant has killed after a period of reflection and deliberation during which a reasonable person\u2019s passions would have cooled. See LaFave, supra \u00a7 15.2(d), at 507; see also State v. Ramirez, 569 P.2d 201, 213 (Ariz. 1977) (four and a half hours sufficient to show cool state of mind); Com. v. Colon, 866 N.E.2d 412, 425 (Mass. 2007) (\u201c[W]here the alleged provocation is followed by at least a few minutes during which the defendant and the victim are 4 The instruction on the elements of provocation manslaughter specified in the text also takes account of the fact that this offense can be charged as a stand-alone crime. See, e.g., State v. Darcy, 121 N.H. 220, 221 (1981). That is, in circumstances where the prosecution is prepared to accept the fact that the defendant meets the criteria for adequate provocation, it can eliminate the need to disprove this circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt by charging the defendant only with violating RSA 630:2, I(a). Cf. Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 199 n.3 (1977) (quoting New York statute providing that in prosecution for manslaughter, provocation need not be proved). separated, and then the defendant seeks out the victim, a charge of voluntary manslaughter based on provocation is not warranted.\u201d (emphasis added)); Com. v. Keohane, 829 N.E.2d 1125, 1130 (Mass. 2005) (\u201c[E]ven where sufficient provocation exists, if a defendant leaves the scene of the provocation . . . and then returns to attack the victim, the defendant is considered to have had adequate opportunity for his anger to subside.\u201d); People v. Pouncey, 471 N.W.2d 346, 351 (Mich. 1991) (going to safe harbor and retrieving gun sufficient cooling time).", "Equally implausible is the defendant\u2019s contention that he had not actually cooled off. \u201c[A defendant] cannot have his homicide reduced to voluntary manslaughter if . . . he has actually cooled off by the time he commits his deadly act.\u201d LaFave, supra \u00a7 15.2(e), at 509. Anger alone is not sufficient to warrant a provocation instruction; the law requires an extreme emotional response to a sufficiently provoking event. Washington v. State, 808 N.E.2d 617, 626 (Ind. 2004). Here, the defendant\u2019s actions leading up to the killing reveal a calm and calculating state of mind, guided not by a sudden, uncontrollable passion but by a desire to avenge the beating of his friend. See LaFave, supra \u00a7 15.2(a), at 494 (\u201cA passion for revenge, of course, will not do.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Even after learning of the attack on Roney, driving from Nashua to Manchester with a gun, meeting his friends to plot a violent response, and locating Roney\u2019s assailants, the defendant had the presence of mind to wipe the gun down with his shirt, rack the slide, and advise Roscoe that the gun was \u201csmooth.\u201d For these reasons, the trial judge acted well within his discretion in refusing to instruct the jury as to provocation manslaughter.", "III", "The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on reckless manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of reckless second-degree murder. In addition to the indictment charging the defendant with first-degree murder, he also was charged in a separate indictment with second-degree murder for allegedly recklessly causing the death of Kar under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. See RSA 630:1-b, I(b) (2007).", "In general, a defendant charged with one offense is entitled to have the jury consider any lesser-included offenses. State v. Cameron, 121 N.H. 348, 350 (1981). This rule safeguards criminal defendants\u2019 due process rights by providing juries an alternative to convicting on only the crime the prosecution opted to charge and minimizing the risk that juries will make \u201call or nothing\u201d decisions. See Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 637-38 (1980). Whether the defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction involves a two-part inquiry: first, the lesser offense must be embraced within the definition of the greater offense; and second, the evidence adduced at trial must provide a rational basis for a guilty finding on the lesser offense. See State v. Thomas, 154 N.H. 189, 192 (2006).", "The State contends that any error in failing to instruct the jury on reckless manslaughter was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. An error is harmless only if it is determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the verdict was not affected by the error. State v. Hernandez, 159 N.H. 394, 402 (2009). The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. Id.", "The State concedes, as it must, that reckless manslaughter is a lesser- included offense of murder. See RSA 630:2, I(b) (2007); State v. Howland, 119 N.H. 413, 416 (1979). We also assume without deciding that the evidence at trial would have supported a rational conclusion that the defendant acted merely recklessly (rather than recklessly with extreme indifference to the value of human life) in giving Roscoe the gun used to kill the victim. In this case, however, any error in refusing to instruct the jury on reckless manslaughter was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant was charged with two offenses: first-degree murder, requiring that the defendant caused Kar\u2019s death purposely, see RSA 630:1-a, I(a) (2007); and reckless second-degree murder, requiring that the defendant caused Kar\u2019s death recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, see RSA 630:1-b, I(b) (2007). The trial judge instructed the jury as to both offenses, correctly identifying their elements for the jury\u2019s consideration. Further, the judge issued an \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction, telling the jury they must first acquit the defendant of first-degree murder before considering the lesser offense of second-degree murder. Because the jury in this case convicted the defendant of purposeful first-degree murder even though they had the option of convicting the defendant of the less serious offense of reckless second-degree murder under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, it follows that the jury would not have considered the still less serious offense of reckless manslaughter (not involving extreme indifference to life) even if it had received such an instruction. We therefore conclude that any error in failing to give such an instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.", "IV", "Finally, the defendant objects to the admission of a jailhouse recording of a conversation between Roscoe (who was at the time incarcerated on an unrelated matter) and a confidential informant. In that recording, Roscoe confessed to having shot the victim and shared certain details leading up to and following the shooting. He also told the informant that the gun was already \u201ccocked back\u201d and referred in the same sentence to \u201cMike,\u201d which prompted the informant to ask Roscoe if he meant that \u201cMikey\u201d \u2013 the defendant \u2013 had cocked the gun for him. Roscoe did not intelligibly answer the informant\u2019s question. The defendant argues that this recording contained inadmissible hearsay and otherwise violated his state and federal confrontation rights. The State contends that the court properly admitted the recording as a statement against penal interest, and that any error was harmless.", "Assuming without deciding that the admission of the exchange constituted error, we agree with the State that any such error was harmless. For an error to be harmless, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict. Hernandez, 159 N.H. at 402. \u201cAn error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity, or weight, and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.\u201d State v. Thompson, 149 N.H. 565, 567 (2003) (quotation omitted). Here, the recorded conversation tended only to prove (1) Roscoe\u2019s role as the shooter and his recollections of certain details of the shooting, and (2) the defendant\u2019s role in cocking the murder weapon for Roscoe. The defendant does not dispute the former point. As to the latter, the defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, Andrew Gonzalez testified at trial that the defendant cocked the gun before handing it to Roscoe, making the disputed portion of the recording cumulative as to that fact. Second, whether or not the defendant cocked the gun is, on the facts here, wholly unnecessary to a finding of accomplice liability. Even if that fact lent some probative weight to the State\u2019s contention that the defendant shared Roscoe\u2019s intent to kill, the other evidence against the defendant overwhelmingly implicated him in the scheme to kill Kar. For example, Clagon testified that, sometime after Roscoe placed a telephone call to Nashua asking the person on the other end of the line to \u201cbring that thing,\u201d the defendant and his brother arrived at Roscoe\u2019s home in Manchester. Roscoe asked the defendant, in person, if he had brought \u201cthe thing\u201d and the defendant confirmed that he had. Clagon and Gonzalez both testified that, after the defendant and his friends located their targets, they parked around the corner to discuss who would do the shooting; Gonzalez testified that the defendant volunteered to do it. And, most importantly, both Clagon and Gonzalez testified that the defendant handed the gun to Roscoe, who then walked around the corner and shot Kar.

The defendant, Ivonne Hernandez, was convicted by a jury of one count of second degree murder, RSA 630:1-b, I(a), (b) (2007), two counts of second degree assault, RSA 631:2, I(b), (c) (2007), and one count of reckless conduct, RSA 631:3 (2007). On appeal, the defendant argues that the Trial Court (Lynn, C.J.) erred by denying her motion to suppress statements she made to the police and by finding one of the State\u2019s witnesses competent to testify. We affirm.", "Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the record supports the following. On the evening of May 1, 2008, Ivonne Hernandez parked her car in the City Hall parking lot in Nashua. She then walked to a nearby bar where she drank four beers and spent several hours watching Karaoke. Meanwhile, Matthew Beaudoin, Robert Goodspeed, Brooke Garger, and Mariah Hughes were at a different bar near City Hall, drinking and socializing.", "Around 1:00 a.m., Beaudoin, Garger, Goodspeed and Hughes left the bar and gathered in the City Hall Parking lot. They stood in the parking lot near Hernandez\u2019s car, talking and laughing. While they were talking, Hernandez left the bar and walked to her car in the City Hall parking lot. As Hernandez approached her car, she saw the group. One of the State\u2019s witnesses testified that Hernandez started yelling at them, saying things like \u201cf--- you.\u201d Garger yelled back, and there was testimony at trial that Hernandez then slapped Garger in the face. At some point, the rest of the group also began yelling and swearing at Hernandez and ridiculing her for a New York Yankees decal she had on her car.", "After this exchange, Hernandez got into her car, started it and backed out of the parking space. One witness testified that as Hernandez was driving away, the group continued to yell at her and Beaudoin banged on her car with his hand. Hernandez left the parking lot, drove across Elm Street and entered a narrow dirt parking lot. As the group left the City Hall parking lot and began walking home, Hernandez turned her car around and drove directly towards the group. At trial, one witness testified that Hernandez then revved her engine and accelerated towards the group. Hughes attempted to jump out of the way, but the car hit her knee, causing a minor injury. The car also struck Beaudoin and then crashed into a parking meter. Beaudoin was severely injured, and died later that morning at 10:30.", "After the crash, Hernandez immediately called 911 and then got out and kneeled by the front of her car. The police arrived at the scene within minutes. Hernandez was visibly distraught, crying and apologizing. She was also bleeding from a laceration to her nose caused by her face striking the steering wheel. She was taken to the hospital for treatment. At approximately 6:30 a.m., Hernandez was taken from the hospital to the police station where she was booked and placed in a holding cell.", "At around 11:00 a.m., Detectives Molinari and Testaverde escorted Hernandez from the holding cell to a room for an interview. The detectives explained that the interview would be audio and video recorded. Hernandez was allowed to bring a blanket with her to the interview and the detectives gave her breakfast bars, juice boxes and cigarettes. The interview lasted approximately two hours.", "At the beginning of the interview, Hernandez informed the detectives that she could read and understand English; that she had obtained her GED; that on the day of the incident she had smoked marijuana; and that she had drunk four beers that night. Testaverde then explained her Miranda rights. As he was explaining these rights, Hernandez asked whether the detectives would \u201cgo against her.\u201d In response, Testaverde told Hernandez, \u201cLast night you were charged um, with a crime . . . . Anything you say, OK, can be used against you in court . . . we write all our reports up, and, and we just present it . . . and say here\u2019s what happened.\u201d Testaverde then finished reviewing her Miranda rights and Hernandez signed a waiver of her rights.", "Shortly thereafter, Hernandez inquired whether Beaudoin \u201c[was] OK.\u201d By this point, Beaudoin had already been pronounced dead, but Testaverde replied, \u201cHe\u2019s getting some treatment . . . . We hope that he\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d At trial, Testaverde testified that although he did downplay the extent of Beaudoin\u2019s injuries, he had not been aware that the victim was dead. Molinari testified that during interviews, he generally employs minimization techniques. He also stated that this interview was not at all confrontational, and that it was actually \u201cfriendly.\u201d", "During the remainder of the interview, Hernandez described the altercation that occurred in the parking lot. She told the detectives that after she got into her car and drove to the dirt parking lot, she was scared. Throughout the interview, Hernandez claimed that she turned her car around only because she wanted to go home, that the incident was an accident, and that she didn\u2019t want to hit anyone. However, when Detective Testaverde said, \u201cYou turn around, you\u2019re gonna say . . . you think you\u2019re a good Red Sox fan . . . I\u2019m a better Yankee\u2019s fan. And I\u2019m going to say screw you. Is that what we\u2019re talking about here?\u201d Hernandez responded, \u201cYa.\u201d", "About fifty-six minutes into the interview, the following exchange occurred:", "DETECTIVE TESTAVERDE: [H]ow close did you want to come to", "[Beaudoin]?", "HERNANDEZ: Not\u2026 pff\u2026", "DETECTIVE TESTAVERDE: Not close?", "HERNANDEZ: No. No.", "DETECTIVE TESTAVERDE: Between you and me, and [Detective", "Molinari], OK, the three of us in this room, OK, inside, inside your", "heart . . . did you want to run that [sic] over?", "HERNANDEZ: No. No. God no. Hernandez then continued to explain that the incident was an accident and that she did not want to hit anyone. However, a few minutes later, Hernandez told Testaverde that witnesses would think she wanted to run Beaudoin over. Testaverde then asked, \u201cIvonne, for that split second, wasn\u2019t that true?\u201d and she replied, \u201cYa.\u201d A few minutes after that, Testaverde inquired how she felt when she was driving toward the group. He asked, \u201c[W]hen you get that sight on these people and you gun it, and you start going, you get that feeling, F-U. Am I wrong?\u201d Hernandez responded, \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d", "Before trial, the defendant moved to have these inculpatory statements suppressed. The trial judge denied the motion.", "I", "On appeal, the defendant argues that the statements she made during the police interrogation were involuntary and, therefore, their admission violated her right to due process under the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. See U.S. CONST., amend. XIV; N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. We first review the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution. State v. Rezk, 150 N.H. 483, 486 (2004).", "Under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, for a defendant\u2019s statement to be admissible at trial, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary. State v. Parker, 160 N.H. 203, 207-08 (2010). Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. Id. at 208. We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s determination of voluntariness unless the determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State. Id.", "The defendant asserts that her statements should have been suppressed as involuntary based upon two separate grounds. First, she contends the statements were made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality. Second, she contends that the statements were involuntary based upon the totality of the circumstances. We address each argument separately.", "A", "Generally, we determine the voluntariness of a statement in light of the totality of all the surrounding circumstances. Parker, 160 N.H. at 208-09. However, the totality of the circumstances test \u201cdoes not apply to promises of confidentiality.\u201d Id. at 209. Instead, the rule is that a statement \u201cmade in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary under the State Constitution.\u201d State v. McDermott, 131 N.H. 495, 501 (1989).", "The defendant argues that Testaverde\u2019s statement \u201c[b]etween me and you and [Molinari]. OK, the three of us in this room, OK, inside, inside your heart . . .\u201d constitutes an impermissible promise of confidentiality. The State disagrees, noting that prior to the interrogation, the defendant was informed of her Miranda rights, including an express warning that what she said could be used against her in court. Further, the State argues, Testaverde never told the defendant, or implied, that her statements would not be used against her criminally and after using the phrase in question, he \u201cquickly changed his language.\u201d", "We first addressed the issue of police promises of confidentiality in State v. McDermott, where we determined that such a promise renders statements involuntary under the State Constitution. McDermott, 131 N.H. at 501. In McDermott, federal drug agents repeatedly misled the defendant into believing his statements would remain confidential. Id. at 498-99. The defendant was an informant for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Id. at 497. When he initially met with DEA agents to discuss becoming an informant, he was reluctant to provide information about himself or his criminal past. Id. The agents assured him that they had never seen a cooperating individual prosecuted by the DEA. Id. The defendant disclosed most of his criminal past and even admitted to knowing who committed an unsolved homicide, but refused to elaborate on his involvement in the homicide. Id. at 497-98.", "Later, the defendant had another meeting with a federal DEA agent because he was running out of money. Id. at 498. During this meeting, the agent placed a \u201cpile of money\u201d on the table in front of the defendant and insisted on knowing the details of the unsolved homicide. Id. at 498-99. The agent then assured the defendant that the information he provided \u201cwould not leave the office.\u201d Id. at 499. The agent explained \u201cthat the DEA simply needed the information . . . to avoid surprises\u201d at trial and that the DEA would never obtain cooperation from informants if it prosecuted them based upon information they provided. Id. The defendant then confessed his involvement in the homicide. After the defendant confessed, the agent told the defendant his statements would not be used against him in court because he did not receive Miranda warnings. Id. The defendant proceeded to elaborate on the details of the murder. Id.", "A few months later, New Hampshire authorities charged the defendant with first degree murder and attempted to use his statements to the DEA agents against him at trial. See id. at 496-99. On appeal, we held law enforcement may not use a promise of confidentiality to obtain incriminating information. Id. at 501. We determined that under the State Constitution, a promise of confidentiality renders statements made in reliance upon that promise involuntary and inadmissible. See id.", "In Parker, we applied the McDermott rule. The defendant in Parker was informed that the interview would be recorded and was given Miranda warnings before the interview began. Parker, 160 N.H. at 205. About two hours into the interview, the detective told the defendant that \u201c[w]hat you tell me and what we deal with in here can stay between me and you.\u201d Id. at 211 (quotation omitted). The detective then further confirmed the promise of confidentiality by saying to the defendant \u201cwhat you tell me in here . . . doesn\u2019t have to go to [your mother].\u201d Id. at 205 (quotation omitted).", "When the defendant did not immediately divulge information, the detective encouraged him to confess by implying that the defendant would not be prosecuted. Id. at 206. Specifically, the detective told the defendant that he needed to know the truth \u201cbefore [he could] say hey, you know what? This is a decent guy. He crossed the line once. . . . It\u2019s behind him. . . . Get a little counseling and, and it\u2019s over.\u201d Id. The trial court determined \u201cthat the detective\u2019s statements merely suggested an atmosphere of confidentiality.\u201d Id. at 210 (quotation omitted). We reversed, finding that the detective\u2019s statement constituted an impermissible promise of confidentiality and, as a result, the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary. Id.", "Although the plain meaning of \u201cbetween me and you\u201d \u2013 the phrase uttered by Testaverde during the interrogation \u2013 implies that what is said will remain confidential, id. at 211, this case differs from McDermott and Parker. In this case, the phrase was used only once. Testaverde did not repeatedly reassure Hernandez that her statements would remain confidential, and he did not use any language implying confidentiality at any other point during the interview. Nor did he ever imply or state that Hernandez would not be prosecuted for the crime. Indeed, he made it clear from the beginning that her statements could, and incriminating statements would, be used to prosecute her.", "Although the law remains that a statement made in reliance upon a promise of confidentiality is involuntary, Testaverde\u2019s statement here was not the kind of impermissible promise of confidentiality that renders statements involuntary under the State Constitution. His statement hinted at confidentiality, but did not explicitly promise it. In Parker, the officers promised that all of the defendant\u2019s statements \u201cin [the interrogation room]\u201d would \u201cstay between\u201d the defendant and the officers, specifically promised that the defendant\u2019s statements would not be revealed to his mother, and later suggested that the defendant would only be required to get \u201ca little counseling.\u201d Parker, 160 N.H. at 211. In McDermott, the officer not only promised that the defendant\u2019s statements would not leave the room, but also promised that without Miranda warnings, these statements would not be used against the defendant. McDermott, 131 N.H. at 499. Here, however, Testaverde used a phrase one time that, at most, implied confidentiality. While we continue to discourage the police from using this type of language, and will continue to examine possible police promises of confidentiality closely, we conclude that in the narrow circumstances of this case, Testaverde\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cbetween you and me\u201d did not rise to the level of such a promise. The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.", "B", "The defendant also argues that her statements were involuntary because in addition to the statement alluding to confidentiality, the totality of the other circumstances surrounding the interview rendered the statements involuntary. Specifically, among other things, the defendant argues that her statements were coerced because she had no prior experience with police, she hit her head on the steering wheel during a serious car accident less than twelve hours before the interrogation, there was no evidence as to whether she had any sleep before the interrogation, and during the interrogation, the police employed minimization and other similar techniques.", "\u201cIn determining whether a [statement] is voluntary, we look at whether the actions of an individual are the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice . . . .\u201d Rezk, 150 N.H. at 487 (quotation omitted). A confession is involuntary if it is \u201cthe product of a will overborne by police tactics, or of a mind incapable of a conscious choice.\u201d Parker, 160 N.H. at 208 (quotation omitted). In making a voluntariness determination, the court considers the totality of all surrounding circumstances, including the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation. Id.", "The evidence supports the determination that the defendant\u2019s statements to the police were voluntary. At the interview, the defendant was allowed a blanket, and was given food and drink. Although the defendant apparently did not have any prior experience with police, she is of at least average intelligence. While lack of police experience is certainly a factor to be considered, it does not necessarily imply that the defendant cannot make a meaningful choice. Cf. State v. Damiano, 124 N.H. 742, 747 (1984) (holding mental illness does not render a confession involuntary as a matter of law). Further, despite the fact that the defendant had been drinking the night before, there was no evidence that she was drunk or significantly impaired at the time of the interview. Cf. State v. Chapman, 135 N.H. 390, 401 (1992) (confession voluntary even though defendant was inebriated at the time of confession).", "The interview itself was \u201cnot an inordinate or oppressive length\u201d \u2013 it lasted less than two hours. See Chapman, 135 N.H. at 401 (finding a two and a half hour interview was not oppressive or inordinate). At the beginning of the interview, Testaverde read and carefully explained the meaning of her Miranda rights and obtained a waiver. While compliance with Miranda does not conclusively establish that a defendant\u2019s subsequent statement was voluntary, it is one of the factors the trial court may consider. State v. Bilodeau, 159 N.H. 759, 764 (2010). The detectives never promised the defendant leniency and, as we explained above, the single reference to confidentiality did not taint the entire interrogation. Further, the interrogation was not hostile. See Chapman, 135 N.H. at 401. At the end of the interview, even Hernandez agreed that the detectives treated her with respect throughout. See State v. Hall, 148 N.H. 671, 673 (2003). Although the detectives admittedly used minimization techniques and were \u201cfriendly\u201d to the defendant, the police are not prohibited from misleading a suspect, id., and friendly police conduct does not alter the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statements. State v. Hammond, 144 N.H. 401, 405-06 (1999).", "In this case, the evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statements were the product of a free and unconstrained choice. Based upon this evidence, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s determination was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.", "In light of the fact that the State Constitution affords greater protection than does the Federal Constitution, see Hammond, 144 N.H. at 404, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution.", "II", "During the initial confrontation in the City Hall parking lot, Colleen Hake, characterized by the parties as a \u201chomeless woman,\u201d was sleeping near the steps of City Hall. The State deposed Hake and planned to call her as a witness at trial. Before trial, the defendant moved to exclude Hake\u2019s testimony on the grounds that Hake was not competent. The court held a competency hearing at which the trial judge found the witness competent to testify, but allowed that his ruling could be revisited.", "In her motion and at the competency hearing, the defendant presented evidence that Hake had mental health issues and delusional beliefs. For example, at the hearing Hake testified that she did not know how many children she had, and that when she was pregnant, her doctor told her she was pregnant with only one child, but when she gave birth, she saw \u201cabout six\u201d babies taken out of the delivery room. Hake also testified that she believed her mother was abducted and replaced by an imposter who looked like her real mother.", "After the hearing, but before Hake testified at trial, the trial judge conducted a voir dire outside the jury\u2019s presence to revisit competency. During voir dire, Hake testified that she understood that she was under oath and accurately answered questions aimed at determining whether she understood the difference between the truth and a lie. Hake was not further questioned about her mental health problems or her delusional beliefs during voir dire. The trial judge again concluded the witness was competent to testify, explaining, \u201cI have no question as to this witness\u2019 understanding of her obligation to tell the truth and her ability to do so.\u201d On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found Hake competent to testify.", "When the record contains evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination of competency, we will not overturn that determination absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. State v. Mills, 136 N.H. 46, 49-50 (1992). \u201c[M]uch depends on the trial court\u2019s firsthand observations of the witness.\u201d State v. Briere, 138 N.H. 617, 620 (1994). Because the trial court is in the unique position of being able to directly observe the witness, \u201cits conclusion that the witness is competent is entitled to great deference.\u201d Id.", "New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 601 creates a presumption that witnesses are competent. See N.H. R. Ev. 601(b). This presumption can be overcome by findings that the witness \u201clacks sufficient capacity to observe, remember and narrate as well as understand the duty to tell the truth.\u201d Id. Implicit in an understanding of the duty to tell the truth is an understanding of the distinction between the truth and a lie. State v. Horak, 159 N.H. 576, 579 (2010). The focus of a competency determination is whether the witness possesses such an understanding.", "In this case, the trial court held a hearing on the motion to exclude the witness\u2019s testimony and later conducted voir dire of the witness during the trial. At both the hearing and voir dire, the court was able to observe the witness. Although the witness had mental health problems and some delusional beliefs, the presumption of competency is not rebutted merely because a witness may be mentally ill. State v. Keyes, 114 N.H. 487, 490-91 (1974) (\u201c[A]lthough at one time an insane person was incompetent to testify, the present rule is that one who is insane . . . may testify if the trial judge finds he [understands the duty to tell the truth].\u201d). The record supports that the witness understood her duty to tell the truth and the trial judge\u2019s determination that the witness was competent to testify was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.", "Affirmed.", "DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

Over the next few weeks, members of the Manchester Police Department met with the informant to discuss what he knew. The informant offered, in exchange for leniency on his pending charges, to provide the police with information about who shot Kar and the person who provided the murder weapon.

The police planned for this conversation to occur at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections after the defendant\u2019s arrest on drug charges.

While the authorization stated that there was \u201creasonable suspicion that evidence of the crime of drug sales and/or homicide w[ould] be derived from this interception,\u201d the assistant attorney general later testified that the language referring to the crime of drug sales was \u201ca typo\u201d and the authorization \u201cwas intended to only be issued for the homicide.\u201d She further stated that she \u201cwas very clear\u201d that during the conversation the informant was \u201cnot to go near the drug sales for which the [d]efendant was . . . incarcerated.\u201d", "After obtaining the authorization, the police arranged to have the informant and the defendant placed in the same cell. They met with the informant once more and reiterated the instruction that he not discuss the defendant\u2019s drug charges. Upon being placed in the cell together, the defendant and the informant began conversing. Notwithstanding the explicit instructions to the contrary, the informant began discussing the defendant\u2019s drug charges and intermittently discussed them throughout the conversation. As the conversation continued, the defendant made statements implicating himself in Kar\u2019s murder, including admitting that he was the shooter. On February 13, the Manchester Police Department obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant for the charge of first-degree murder; he was indicted on the murder and attempted first-degree assault charges on May 16, 2008.", "Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the recorded statements, arguing that any statements he made in response to the informant\u2019s questions about the drug charges were elicited in violation of his right to counsel on those charges. He contended that any statements made after this violation, including statements about the shooting, were the fruit of that violation and, therefore, must be suppressed as the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d He further argued that \u201c[t]he [S]tate\u2019s conduct in this case was fundamentally unfair and thus a violation of due process.\u201d (Bolding omitted.)", "The State conceded that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached with respect to the drug charges and, thus, any discussion between the informant and the defendant relating to the drug charges would be inadmissible at a trial on those charges.

The State maintained, however, that because the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had not yet attached on the charges related to the shooting, there had been no violation of his right to counsel on those charges and the statements related to the shooting were admissible.

State, 93 S.W.3d 16, 24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). This issue was recognized by the Supreme Court in Moulton. There, the Court \u201cconsidered the constitutional implications of a surreptitious investigation that yielded evidence pertaining to two crimes. For one, the defendant had been indicted; for the other, he had not.\u201d Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 431 (1986) (discussing Moulton). The Court held that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel was violated by the admission of incriminating statements he made to his codefendant, who was acting as a government informant, concerning the crime for which he had been indicted, even though the police had recorded the meeting with the informant to gain information on a separate uncharged crime. Moulton, 474 U.S. at 176-80.", "In so doing, the Court stated:", "The police have an interest in the thorough investigation of crimes", "for which formal charges have already been filed.

Moulton, 474 U.S. at 179-80. The court noted in a footnote that \u201c[i]ncriminating statements pertaining to other crimes, as to which the Sixth Amendment right has not yet attached, are, of course, admissible at a trial of those offenses.\u201d Id. at 180 n.16. The Court reaffirmed this reasoning in Moran when it explained that Moulton \u201cmade clear . . . that the evidence concerning the crime for which the defendant had not been indicted \u2014 evidence obtained in precisely the same manner from the identical suspect \u2014 would be admissible at a trial limited to those charges.\u201d Moran, 475 U.S. at 431; see McNeil, 501 U.S. at 176.", "There is no dispute that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached with respect to the drug charges and that this right was violated by the informant\u2019s questioning of the defendant about those charges. Indeed, the State concedes that \u201cduring any proceedings on the drug charges, the evidence that the informant elicited could not be used.\u201d However, because judicial proceedings had not yet commenced against the defendant with respect to the shooting, his right to counsel had not attached as to those charges. Accordingly, the informant\u2019s questioning of the defendant regarding the shooting did not violate his right to counsel and his statements as to the shooting were admissible at the trial on those charges. See McNeil, 501 U.S. at 176; State v. Kilgus, 128 N.H. 577, 593-94 (1986) (finding no violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel when informant elicited statements from the defendant about uncharged attempted murder even though defendant was already charged with witness tampering).", "Nonetheless, the defendant maintains that \u201c[t]he statements about the shooting followed [the informant\u2019s] numerous references to the drug charges\u201d and, as a result, \u201conly occur[red] though [the] violation of [the defendant\u2019s] right to counsel\u201d on those charges. Thus, he urges us to apply the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine and hold that his statements concerning the shooting should have been suppressed. In making this argument, he relies upon a number of cases. See, e.g., Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004); Fellers v. United States, 540 U.S. 519 (2004); Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984); Henry, 447 U.S. 264; Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967); Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293 (1966); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963); State v. Panarello, 157 N.H. 204 (2008); State v. Roache, 148 N.H. 45 (2002); State v. Gravel, 135 N.H. 172 (1991); State v. Baillargeon, 124 N.H. 355 (1983). None of these cases, however, stands for the proposition that statements regarding uncharged offenses, elicited at the same time as statements regarding charged offenses for which there was a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel, constitute a \u201cfruit\u201d of that violation. And we decline to adopt such a rule.", "This decision is consistent with \u201cthe general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\u201d United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 364 (1981). The Supreme Court\u2019s approach in addressing violations of the Sixth Amendment has \u201cbeen to identify and then neutralize the taint by tailoring relief appropriate in the circumstances to assure the defendant the effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial.\u201d Id. at 365. Accordingly, the Court has looked to whether \u201cthe constitutional infringement identified has had or threatens some adverse effect upon the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s representation or has produced some other prejudice to the defense.\u201d Id. \u201cAbsent such impact on the criminal proceeding, however, there is no basis for imposing a remedy in that proceeding, which can go forward with full recognition of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel and to a fair trial.\u201d Id.", "The defendant\u2019s right to counsel in this case was violated on the drug charges. The appropriate remedy for this constitutional violation was to exclude evidence obtained from this violation from trial on those charges. However, there was no violation with respect to the shooting charges. Accordingly, \u201c[t]here is no effect of a constitutional dimension which needs to be purged to make certain that [the defendant] has been effectively represented and not unfairly convicted.\u201d Id. at 366.", "Citing Gilbert, the defendant argues that \u201c[t]he offense-specific rule does not affect application of the exclusionary rule: statements taken in violation of the right to counsel are not admissible in any case.\u201d The simple answer to this argument is that, as discussed above, there was no right-to-counsel violation with respect to the statements concerning the shooting.", "The defendant argues that we should find the State Constitution more protective than the Federal Constitution under these circumstances. He maintains that the above-quoted provision of Part I, Article 15 is \u201cmore broadly-worded than the federal constitution\u201d and that we have \u201ctaken a more protective view of the right to counsel under the state constitution\u201d with respect to custodial interrogations and the right against self-incrimination. He further contends that we have implemented the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine \u201cin a more protective manner than the Supreme Court.\u201d We do not disagree. However, we have never construed the state constitutional right to counsel as arising earlier than the Sixth Amendment right to counsel; nor have we found that the use of an informant, in and of itself, violates our constitution. We decline to do either in this case.", "Finally, the defendant argues that \u201c[s]anctioning the State\u2019s actions here would permit a knowing violation of the law for the purpose of eliciting incriminating statements from a suspect,\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch a holding would not comport with due process.\u201d The New Hampshire Constitution guarantees every citizen due process of the law. State v. Damiano, 124 N.H. 742, 746 (1984); N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 15. The standard for determining whether a law or procedure violates due process is whether it is fundamentally fair. State v. Barnett, 147 N.H. 334, 336 (2001). Fundamental fairness requires that the government conduct conform to the community\u2019s sense of justice, decency and fair play. State v. Mwangi, 161 N.H. 699, 703 (2011).", "The defendant contends that, under the decision in this case, \u201cthe State . . . has every incentive to intentionally violate a suspect\u2019s right to counsel on one charge in order to elicit inculpatory statements about an uncharged crime\u201d and \u201cmay decide that foregoing use of a defendant\u2019s statements in violation of the right to counsel is a small price to pay in order to purchase the defendant\u2019s trust in an informant on a different charge.\u201d Undoubtedly, the informant\u2019s conduct in this case violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel with respect to the drug charges. We do not find, however, that these facts demonstrate \u201cthe kind of misbehavior that so shocks the sensibilities of civilized society\u201d as to constitute a due process violation. Moran, 475 U.S. at 433-34.", "Moreover, the State\u2019s use of an informant does not constitute a per se constitutional violation.

We affirm. I. Background", "The following facts are derived primarily from the affidavit submitted to support the warrant to search the defendant\u2019s computer. On July 29, 2009, the Concord police received a complaint that a man with a vehicle bearing New Hampshire license plate \u201cWOODFLR\u201d had masturbated in front of the complainant, showed the complainant numerous digital images of female children engaged in sexual activity, and asked the complainant if he would like to have sex with minor girls. The man also told the complainant that he had been having sex with his fifteen-year-old step-daughter since she was ten years old.", "After running the license plate number through the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles\u2019 computer system, the police discovered that the plate was registered to Robert Johnston. On July 31, 2009, the police executed a warrant to search his home. While there, the police interviewed his step- daughter, who confirmed that Johnston had been sexually abusing her since she was in sixth grade. The step-daughter told the police that \u201cat some point,\u201d Johnston took nude photographs of her and sent them to others using his cellular telephone; she said that some of these photographs were sexually explicit.", "The step-daughter also described engaging in sexual activity with Johnston on July 28, 2009, in the presence of a man named \u201cJohn.\u201d Specifically, she described performing oral sex on Johnston in his parked vehicle while John stood outside the vehicle and masturbated. She stated that then John inserted his hand in her vagina. She told the police that on that same day, she and Johnston went to John\u2019s house in Pembroke and had sexual intercourse in John\u2019s bedroom. The step-daughter said that John joined her and Johnston on the bed and masturbated while he watched them have sex.", "The step-daughter told the police that John\u2019s bedroom is located on the second floor and that to access it one has to walk through a sitting room in which there is a computer. The step-daughter told the police that on July 31, 2009, she observed John and Johnston \u201cexchange[ ] messages by phone.\u201d The step-daughter said that John drove a yellow SUV with the license plate \u201cAJ- WINGS.\u201d", "On August 3, 2009, the police learned that a yellow SUV with the license plate \u201cAJ-WINGS\u201d is registered to the defendant. The police also found the defendant\u2019s Pembroke address. Based upon all of this information, the police submitted an application for a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s home, computer, and cell phone for evidence of child pornography. The Hooksett District Court granted the application on August 4, 2009.", "The search of the defendant\u2019s computer revealed one computer file containing four images and two videos of children engaging in sexual acts.

Discussion", "On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution by denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home computer. He asserts that the affidavit in support of the warrant application failed to set forth sufficient facts linking any child pornography to his computer. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).", "A. Standard of Review", "Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution requires that search warrants be issued only upon a finding of probable cause. State v. Ward, 163 N.H. 156, 159 (2012). Probable cause exists if a person of ordinary caution would justifiably believe that what is sought will be found through the search and will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction. Id. \u201cThe police must demonstrate in an application for a search warrant that there is a substantial likelihood that the items sought will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d State v. Fish, 142 N.H. 524, 527-28 (1994). \u201cHowever, they need not establish with certainty, or even beyond a reasonable doubt, that the search will lead to the desired result.\u201d Id. at 528 (quotation omitted).", "We apply a totality-of-the-circumstances test to review the sufficiency of an affidavit submitted with a warrant application. Id. The task of the issuing district court is to \u201cmake a practical, common-sense decision whether given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before [it], including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d Illinois v.

Nevertheless, under this standard we \u201cmay properly conclude that . . . [a] warrant was invalid because the [district court\u2019s] probable-cause determination reflected an improper analysis of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 915 (1984). \u201cWhile an affidavit may establish probable cause without the observance of contraband at the location to be searched,\u201d to meet constitutional muster, \u201caffidavits must establish a sufficient nexus between the illicit objects and the place to be searched.\u201d Ward, 163 N.H. at 160. As a reviewing court, we may consider only the information that the police brought to the issuing court\u2019s attention (here, the district court). See United States v. Jacobson, 466 U.S. 109, 112 n.2 (1984).", "We review the superior court\u2019s order de novo except with respect to any controlling factual findings. Ward, 163 N.H. at 159. In this case, we review the superior court\u2019s decision de novo as there were no controlling facts determined by it in the first instance. See Fish, 142 N.H. at 528.", "We afford much deference to the district court\u2019s probable cause determination and will not invalidate warrants by reading the supporting affidavit in a hypertechnical sense.

Affidavit", "The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence linking the contraband (child pornography) to the location to be searched (his computer). See Ward, 163 N.H. at 160. However, his argument depends upon a hypertechnical reading of the supporting affidavit. Reviewing the totality of the circumstances, and in light of the deference accorded to the district court\u2019s finding of probable cause and the preference to be accorded to warrants, we conclude that the district court had a substantial basis for believing that the warrant was supported by probable cause. See id. at 159.", "In arguing that the search warrant failed to establish a sufficient nexus between child pornography and the defendant\u2019s computer, the defendant relies primarily upon State v. Silvestri, 136 N.H. 522, 526-28 (1992), and Ward, 163 N.H. at 160-61. Silvestri concerned a search of a defendant\u2019s residence for evidence of controlled drugs. Silvestri, 136 N.H. at 523-24. We observed that the only fact alleged in the affidavit that referred to the defendant\u2019s residence was the telephone number the informant dialed to buy marijuana. Id. at 524, 526. The affidavit did not allege that the telephone number the informant dialed was the number servicing the defendant\u2019s residence, as opposed to his office or cell phone numbers. Id. at 526. Notably, the informant never stated that he or she saw drugs at the defendant\u2019s residence or that the informant believed that the defendant kept drugs there. Id. We concluded that even if the magistrate had reasonably inferred that the telephone number was the defendant\u2019s home number, this, alone, was insufficient to establish the required nexus between the defendant\u2019s home and his drug-dealing activities. Id. at 526-28. Accordingly, we held that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search. Id. at 526-28.", "Ward concerned the search of a defendant\u2019s home and computer for evidence of child pornography. Ward, 163 N.H. at 157. We concluded that Ward was distinguishable from Silvestri because, in Ward, there were several alleged facts connecting the defendant\u2019s home and computer to child pornographic images. Id. at 160.", "In Ward, although no child pornography was seen on the defendant\u2019s computer or in his residence, child pornography was found in his garage, and there were facts linking this pornography to a computer and linking a computer to the defendant\u2019s residence. Id. at 160-61. Specifically, a neighbor saw two pieces of paper in the defendant\u2019s garage, which depicted sexually explicit photographs of a nude girl, and which appeared to have been printed out from a computer. Id. at 160-61. Moreover, the neighbor did not see any computer equipment in the garage, but had observed the defendant using a laptop computer in his home. Id. at 161. Considering the totality of these circumstances, and viewing this information in a common-sense manner, we concluded that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that the requisite probable cause existed. Id. at 159, 160-61.", "Here, as in Ward, there was no child pornography observed on the defendant\u2019s computer; however, there are \u201cother circumstances that would support the inference\u201d that child pornography was located there. Id. at 160 (quotation omitted). Specifically, the affidavit alleged that Johnston\u2019s cell phone contained sexually explicit images of children and that he used it to transmit such images to others. The affidavit also alleged that Johnston and the defendant exchanged messages. These facts are sufficient to support an inference that Johnston used his cell phone to transmit at least one sexually explicit image of a child to the defendant\u2019s cell phone.", "The affidavit also alleged that the defendant touched the minor victim sexually and watched her and Johnston engage in sexual activity. This fact supports an inference that the defendant is also interested in images of child sexual activity.", "Finally, the affidavit included the officer\u2019s assertion based upon his training and experience that those who \u201chave demonstrated an interest or preference in sexual activity with children . . . are likely to keep secreted, but readily at hand, sexually explicit visual images depicting children,\u201d which they often \u201ccarry . . . upon their person in the form of USB drives or other media storage devices,\u201d and that persons receiving such images will copy them onto their computers\u2019 hard drives. Based upon the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that the affidavit afforded the district court a substantial basis for believing that the defendant\u2019s computer contained child pornography. See id. at 159, 160-61.", "In arguing for a contrary result, the defendant relies upon cases from other jurisdictions concluding that evidence of child molestation alone does not establish probable cause for a search warrant for child pornography. See, e.g., United States v. Hodson, 543 F.3d 286, 292 (6th Cir. 2008). But see United States v. Colbert, 605 F.3d 573, 578 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1469 (2011). The defendant\u2019s reliance upon this case law is, however, misplaced. In the instant case, there was evidence not only that the defendant molested the minor victim, but also that he watched Johnston molest her while he masturbated. In other words, there was evidence that the defendant was a voyeur of child sexual activity.", "The defendant also relies upon cases from other jurisdictions ruling that an officer\u2019s general conclusions based upon his training and expertise are relevant to the probable cause determination only when they are supported by particularized facts. See United States v. Zimmerman, 277 F.3d 426, 433 n.4 (3d Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Clark, 668 F.3d 934, 935-37, 939-40 (7th Cir. 2012). He contends that in this case, there were no particularized facts to justify reliance upon the officer\u2019s general conclusions. Assuming that we were to follow the law from these jurisdictions, we disagree. In addition to the officer\u2019s conclusions, there was evidence that the defendant molested the minor victim, watched her have sex with Johnston while he masturbated, and exchanged messages with Johnston who used his cell phone to transmit sexually explicit images of children to others.", "As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than the State Constitution does under these circumstances, see Ward, 163 N.H. at 163, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.", "Affirmed.", "HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.

We affirm.", "On September 12, 2007, Officer Gary Allen of the Pembroke Police Department received a call from a pastor at a church in Pembroke. The pastor told Allen that he had received a call from a parishioner named Allen Brown and that Brown told him that he saw what appeared to be child pornography in his neighbor\u2019s garage.", "After speaking with the pastor, Allen telephoned Brown. Brown identified the defendant as his neighbor and told Allen that he and the defendant had a verbal agreement that they could go into each other\u2019s garage to borrow tools. On September 10, he went into the defendant\u2019s detached garage to borrow a drill and noticed a stack of magazines on the floor. There were several pieces of paper on top of the magazines that contained pictures of a female juvenile performing sexual acts on adult men. It appeared to Brown that the pictures were printed from a computer.", "Allen asked Brown if he would come to the police station for an interview and Brown agreed. Later that day, Detective Dawn Shea confirmed that the residence identified by Brown was owned by the defendant and his wife.", "On September 13, Allen and Shea met with Brown at the police station. Brown reiterated the information he had provided Allen regarding his relationship with the defendant. He explained that when he went to the defendant\u2019s garage on September 10, he saw a piece of paper on top of a pile of magazines that appeared to be longer than standard size paper and printed from a computer. He stated that one of the papers contained a photograph of a nude girl between the ages of twelve and fourteen lying on a white sheet and the other had a photograph of what appeared to be the same girl performing oral sex on a nude adult male. The magazines appeared to be pornographic in nature but Brown could not identify if they were adult or child pornography magazines.", "Brown also indicated that the defendant and his wife each have a laptop computer, which they use on a daily basis. He stated that he had observed them using their computers inside their house; however, he had never seen any computer equipment in the garage. He indicated that at one time the defendant had a desktop computer but that he did not know whether the defendant still owned it. Brown further stated that the defendant spends a lot of time in the garage but that he had never seen the defendant\u2019s wife go into the garage.", "That same day, Allen applied for a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle, his residence, including the detached garage and a shed, and his person. In the supporting affidavit, Allen described his conversations with Brown. The attachment to the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant outlined the property for which Allen sought the search warrant, which included \u201c[a]ny and all computer equipment\u201d as well as \u201c[c]amera equipment.\u201d", "A district court judge issued a warrant and members of the Pembroke Police Department executed it on September 14, 2007. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized during the search. After a hearing, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to the extent that the search warrant affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle and his person, and to search for adult pornography. However, the court found that the affidavit established probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s house and garage and, therefore, the court denied the motion to suppress evidence derived from those searches.", "On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home and any computer in his home because the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of child pornography would be found in those areas as required by Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He argues that there was no information in the affidavit linking the images Brown observed in the garage to the computers Brown said he saw the defendant and his wife using nor was there any information \u201csuggesting [he] stored child pornography in his home or on any computer in his home.\u201d We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution, State v.

Orde, 161 N.H. 260, 269 (2010). To establish probable cause, the affiant need only present the magistrate with sufficient facts and circumstances to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the evidence or contraband sought will be found in the place to be searched. Id. The affiant need not \u201cestablish with certainty, or even beyond a reasonable doubt, that the search will lead to the desired result.\u201d State v.

While an affidavit may establish probable cause without the observance of contraband at the location to be searched, id. at 527, in order to establish probable cause to search a residence, affidavits must establish a sufficient nexus between the illicit objects and the place to be searched. Dalling, 159 N.H. at 186.", "Relying upon Silvestri, the defendant argues that \u201c[t]he mere fact that the images found in the garage tended to establish that [he] illegally possessed those images did not, without more, support a finding that there was a fair probability that other such evidence was in his home.\u201d Silvestri, however, is distinguishable from the instant case. Silvestri dealt with a search of the defendant\u2019s residence for evidence of controlled drugs. Silvestri, 136 N.H. at 523-24. As in this case, the defendant argued on appeal that the evidence obtained from the search should have been suppressed because the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application did not establish probable cause to search his residence. Id. at 525. We agreed, finding that \u201c[t]he only fact alleged in the affidavit that possibly refer[red] to the defendant\u2019s residence [wa]s the telephone number dialed by the informant [to purchase marijuana] and confirmed by\u201d an investigating officer. Id. at 526. We found that, even assuming the magistrate drew the inference that the telephone number was the defendant\u2019s home number, the informant did not state that it was his or her belief that drugs were kept at the defendant\u2019s residence or that he or she had seen drugs at the defendant\u2019s residence. Id. Nor did the informant \u201cindicate any other circumstances that would support the inference, by either the affiant or the magistrate, that the defendant stored drugs in his residence.\u201d Id. at 527. We declined the State\u2019s invitation to adopt a per se rule that if a magistrate finds that a person is a drug dealer, then a finding of probable cause to search that person\u2019s residence automatically follows, stating that \u201cwe have consistently required some nexus between the defendant\u2019s residence and drug-dealing activities in order to establish probable cause to search the residence.\u201d Id.", "In the instant case, unlike in Silvestri, while no child pornography was seen on the defendant\u2019s computer or in his residence, there were \u201cother circumstances that would support the inference,\u201d id., that the defendant had evidence of child pornography in these areas. With respect to his computer, the affidavit described Brown\u2019s first-hand observation of two pieces of paper in the defendant\u2019s garage depicting sexually explicit photographs of a nude girl between the ages of twelve and fourteen years old. Brown described the papers as being longer than a standard size piece of paper and as appearing to have been printed off of a computer. He further indicated that he had observed the defendant and his wife using their laptop computers on a daily basis and that he knew the defendant had previously owned a desktop computer but that he was unsure if the defendant still owned it.", "As to the defendant\u2019s residence, the affidavit averred that Brown had never seen any computer equipment in the garage but that he had observed the defendant using his laptop computer inside the house on a regular basis. Based on the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that the affidavit demonstrates a fair probability that evidence of child pornography would be found in the defendant\u2019s home or on his computer. \u201cWhile no single piece of evidence may be conclusive, if the pieces seem to fit neatly together, the magistrate may find probable cause that evidence of a crime may be found at the defendant\u2019s home.\u201d State v. Westover, 127 N.H. 130, 132-33 (1985) (neighbor\u2019s testimony regarding frequent visitors at the defendant\u2019s residence and police corroboration that the defendant\u2019s phone number was linked to an ongoing drug investigation by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration enough to establish probable cause to search defendant\u2019s residence).", "The defendant further argues that, \u201cwithout additional information,\u201d the inference that child pornography suspects are likely to store images in safe and secret places, such as their homes, \u201cis not reasonable here.\u201d He contends that \u201c[w]arrant applications often include expertise of law enforcement officials about a particular type of crime and the customary practices of persons suspected of being engaged in such criminal activity\u201d and here, the affidavit contained no such information. Certainly additional information regarding an affiant\u2019s training and experience could be helpful in establishing probable cause. Here, however, neither the inference suggested by the defendant nor additional information regarding the affiant\u2019s training and experience were required to establish probable cause. The magistrate was presented with information indicating that what appeared to be a computer printout of child pornography was observed in the defendant\u2019s garage but no computer equipment had ever been seen in the garage and the defendant had only been seen using his computer in his home. When this information is viewed in a common-sense manner, we find that it was reasonable for the magistrate to infer that evidence of child pornography would be found on the defendant\u2019s computer or in his home. Cf. State v. Kirsch, 139 N.H. 647, 651 (1995) (finding that \u201c\u2018pedophile profile\u2019 reciting the types of material collected by child molesters and their proclivity for retaining it\u201d was not required to establish probable cause where a common-sense inference about the longevity of child pornography retained by the sexual abuser could \u201creasonably be drawn from the nature of the items themselves, such as the photographs taken of the children\u201d).", "The defendant also maintains that because he shared his home with his wife, \u201cit was more likely that if [he] had additional child pornography he would have stored it somewhere other than in his home, such as in the garage.\u201d Merely because the defendant could have stored additional child pornography in the garage rather than in the home does not defeat probable cause in this case. Our duty as the reviewing court \u201cis simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983) (quotation, brackets and ellipsis omitted). Here, we are convinced that this standard was met.", "We are further not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search of his home and computer because Brown \u201cdid not describe the physical attributes of the paper [or provide other information] that would have tended to show that [it] originated from a computer rather than, for example, a photo printer or a copier.\u201d While the affidavit did not completely refute the idea that the paper originated from somewhere other than a computer, we have never required \u201ccomplete certainty . . . when determining whether probable cause to search exists.\u201d State v. Daniel, 142 N.H. 54, 59 (1997) (quotation omitted). Similarly, we do not believe it is fatal to the warrant\u2019s validity that the affidavit did not contain information indicating \u201cthat [the defendant] or his wife had a printer.\u201d A common-sense inference that a printer would likely be found in the defendant\u2019s home may be reasonably drawn from the fact that the affidavit contained information indicating both the defendant and his wife owned laptop computers, which they used in the home on a daily basis.", "Finally, the defendant argues that \u201cto the extent the trial court inferred, as the State suggested in its objection [to his motion to suppress], that the images found in the garage originated from the internet or that [he] made them using a digital camera, those inferences also lack foundation.\u201d (Citation omitted.) It is not clear from a review of the trial court\u2019s order, however, that it drew such an inference in rendering its decision. Moreover, we do not believe that this inference was necessary to establish probable cause for the search of the defendant\u2019s home and his computer. As stated above, the affidavit contained information indicating that what appeared to be a computer printout of child pornography was observed in the defendant\u2019s garage and the defendant had only been seen using his computer in his home. The magistrate could conclude that there was a substantial likelihood that the images originated from somewhere in the defendant\u2019s home and thus, that evidence or contraband related to child pornography would be found there. We note that the defendant has not raised an argument on appeal concerning the breadth of the search warrant.", "As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does our State Constitution under these circumstances, see Fish, 142 N.H. at 527-28; Gates, 462 U.S. at 238, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.", "Affirmed.", "DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN and LYNN, JJ., concurred.

On appeal, he argues that the Trial Court (Wageling, J.) erred when it refused to give: (1) a mutual combat instruction on the class B felony charge; and (2) a \u201cspecial\u201d jury instruction that the prior convictions of several of the State\u2019s witnesses were relevant to their credibility.

His cell mate was Michael Horrigan. On May 31, 2009, Horrigan was playing cards with two other inmates, Cullen and Chase, when Matton approached Horrigan and accused him of damaging his personal property. Horrigan and Matton argued as they proceeded back to their cell. The argument became louder. Matton punched Horrigan in the jaw. Horrigan fell, and hit his head against a steel table as he fell. Horrigan was subsequently transported to the Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, where he was diagnosed as suffering from a fractured jaw, a right temporal bone fracture, bilateral subdural hematomas and bleeding within the temporal horns of the brain and within the left frontal area of the brain.", "The defendant was indicted on one count of assault by a prisoner, charged as a class A felony, and one count of assault by a prisoner, charged as a class B felony. Three of the witnesses who testified at trial for the State had been inmates at the Strafford County House of Corrections at the time of the assault. The trial court denied defense counsel\u2019s requests for: (1) a mutual combat jury instruction; and (2) an instruction that advised the jury that the prior felony convictions of the inmate witnesses could be considered to assess their credibility. The jury found the defendant guilty on both charges and this appeal followed.", "Whether to give a requested jury instruction, and the scope and wording of an instruction, is within the sound discretion of the trial court; we review its decision on these issues to determine whether it is sustainable. State v. Davidson, 163 N.H. 462, 472 (2012). The purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case. Id.

Id. We determine whether the instructions adequately and accurately explained each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case. Id.", "The defendant first argues that he was entitled to a mutual combat instruction. Although we have not been provided with a copy of the indictments, the record reflects that the State indicted the defendant on two charges. See RSA 642:9, IV. The first charge alleged that he caused serious bodily injury to the victim; the second alleged that he caused bodily injury to the victim. Given the defendant\u2019s status as a prisoner, the offense is classified as a class A felony if the State proves that the defendant committed a \u201cfirst degree or second degree assault as defined under RSA 631:1 or RSA 631:2.\u201d RSA 642:9, IV. The offense is a class B felony if it is \u201csimple assault as defined under RSA 631:2-a unless [it is] committed in a fight entered into by mutual consent, in which case it is a misdemeanor.\u201d Id.", "The defendant was entitled to the requested mutual combat jury instruction only if there was some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense.

Absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion, we will affirm the denial of a requested jury instruction. Id.", "The defendant argues that he presented sufficient evidence of a fight entered into by mutual consent. He cites evidence that the victim: (1) made a derogatory comment about the defendant\u2019s girlfriend in front of other inmates; (2) agreed to follow the defendant back to an area near their cell; (3) faced the defendant; (4) \u201cstood within an [arm\u2019s] length of him\u201d; and (5) \u201cargued loudly back and forth with him.\u201d", "Even if we assume that the defendant presented sufficient evidence to support a mutual combat instruction on the class B felony charge, we conclude that he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to give the instruction. The trial court sentenced the defendant on only the class A felony. A mutual combat instruction is relevant only to the class B felony charge and the defendant did not receive a sentence for that offense. See State v. Lambert, 147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (to establish that trial court ruling is not sustainable, defendant must demonstrate that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case). In reaching this conclusion, we have considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that if we were to find error, he would be entitled to a retrial on the class B felony charge because if acquitted, he might receive a lesser sentence on his class A conviction. We note that the trial court stated at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI, after some brief discussion with counsel, indicated that it was my sense . . . that one of these charges ends up being subsumed into the other, that is the Class B felony subsumed into the Class A felony. . . . [S]ince both injuries were the result of the same one hit and both parties agree to that, I feel that in terms of sentencing, I will not sentence him separately on each of these offenses. I believe that the double jeopardy provisions either federally or through the state\u2019s analysis would restrict me from doing that.\u201d Thus, the trial court apparently viewed the charged offenses as alternative charges. Having reviewed the record before us, including the trial court\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the trial court\u2019s denial of a mutual combat instruction on the class B felony charge prejudiced his case, and therefore he has failed to establish an unsustainable exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. See id.", "The defendant also argues that the trial court erred \u201cwhen it refused to give a special jury instruction that [the inmate] witnesses\u2019 prior convictions were relevant to their credibility.\u201d In considering this claim of error, we review the instructions in their entirety.

He also admitted that he had asked for favorable treatment on the pending charges in exchange for his testimony. Chase and Lewis also testified about their prior convictions.", "The defendant concedes that the witnesses were impeached with their convictions pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 609(a). He argues, however, that the trial court erred in failing to specifically instruct the jury that it could consider the witnesses\u2019 prior convictions to assess their credibility. He contends that the court\u2019s failure to give a general witness credibility instruction in its final charge required the requested specific instruction so that the jury would understand how to evaluate the witness conviction evidence.", "Although the trial court did not give an instruction specific to the use of prior convictions to assess the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses, the court gave the following general credibility instructions at the beginning of the trial.", "In deciding whether the State has proven the charge against", "the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must consider the", "credibility of the witnesses; that is, it\u2019s up to you to decide whom to", "believe.", "If there\u2019s any conflict between the witnesses, then you must", "resolve the conflict and decide what the truth is.

State v. Knight, 161 N.H. 338, 343 (2011). As we have long recognized, the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether a particular instruction should be given. Id.", "Consistent with our established practice, we decline to adopt a rule that would require that a trial court instruct a jury that evidence of the convictions of a witness, other than the defendant, may be considered in assessing that witness\u2019s credibility. Compare State v. Hebert, 158 N.H. 306, 313 (2009) (because evidence of prior conviction is inherently prejudicial to defendant, trial court must give limiting instruction when it admits such evidence for impeachment purposes pursuant to Rule 609(a) unless defendant expressly waives his right to such instruction on the record). Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of another purpose for which the convictions might be admitted. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201cOne way of discrediting the witness is to introduce evidence of a prior criminal conviction of that witness. By so doing the cross-examiner intends to afford the jury a basis to infer that the witness\u2019 character is such that he would be less likely than the average trustworthy citizen to be truthful in his testimony. The introduction of evidence of a prior crime is thus a general attack on the credibility of the witness.\u201d Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316 (1974). Having reviewed in their entirety the instructions given by the trial court, we conclude that the court did not err when it declined to give a specific jury instruction that the witnesses\u2019 prior convictions were relevant to their credibility. Although a trial court may give such a limiting instruction, it is not required when the witness is not the defendant.", "Finally, we caution that although a trial court may provide preliminary jury instructions on witness credibility, along with other preliminary instructions, it should provide the jury with all necessary instructions, including witness credibility instructions, in its final oral charge. Because the trial court in this case, however, provided the jury with written copies of its preliminary instructions, which included instructions on witness credibility, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to include witness credibility instructions in its final charge does not warrant reversal.", "Affirmed.", "DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.

The defendant, Matthew Tabaldi, appeals his convictions, following a jury trial, for the sale of a narcotic drug (cocaine), see RSA 318-B:2, I (2011); possession of narcotic drugs (crack cocaine and cocaine), see id.; felon in possession of an electronic defense weapon, see RSA 159:21 (2002); and receiving stolen property (a firearm), see RSA 637:7 (2007). He argues that the Superior Court (Lewis, J.) erred by: (1) denying his motion to strike a prospective juror; (2) denying his motions to dismiss the possession of an electronic defense weapon and possession of crack cocaine charges; and (3) admitting certain evidence over his objection. We affirm all of the defendant\u2019s convictions except his conviction for being a felon in possession of an electronic defense weapon.

I. Background", "The jury could have found the following facts. On March 25, 2009, Heather Taylor was the target of a drug investigation conducted by the New Hampshire Police Narcotics Investigation Unit. The police suspected that Taylor was transporting large quantities of heroin and cocaine from Massachusetts into New Hampshire. The police planned a \u201ccontrolled buy.\u201d In a controlled buy, the police use a confidential informant (CI) to purchase drugs from a target using paper currency that has been documented by the recording of the bills\u2019 serial numbers (also known as \u201cbuy money\u201d). In a controlled buy, officers search the CI before and after sending him or her to purchase the drugs to ensure that the CI does not have unaccounted-for money or contraband. Officers also conduct surveillance of the CI and the target during the investigation.", "The police planned for a female CI to purchase drugs from Taylor on March 25. The plan was for the CI to go to Taylor\u2019s residence in Rochester, accompany her to Massachusetts, and then return with her to New Hampshire. At approximately 9:00 a.m., State Police Trooper Bryan Trask, Sergeant Ellen Arcieri, and a detective from the Rochester Police Department met with the CI. They searched the CI and her belongings and vehicle, and found no money or contraband. Trask then supplied the CI with $300 in documented bills (the buy money).", "At 11:40 a.m., the CI drove to Taylor\u2019s residence in Rochester, and police officers followed. Officers observed the CI enter the residence, where she remained for between sixty and ninety minutes. While the CI was inside the residence, however, the target of the investigation changed from Taylor to the defendant. The CI and Taylor left Taylor\u2019s residence and drove together to a residence in North Hampton that the defendant shared with Kenneth Vaillancourt. Surveillance units followed.", "At approximately 2:00 p.m., the CI and Taylor arrived at the North Hampton house. Vaillancourt was at work. Approximately forty-five minutes after entering the house, the CI exited alone, got into her car, and drove directly to a prearranged meeting place. There, she gave Trask a small plastic baggie containing cocaine. After receiving the cocaine, officers searched the CI, her vehicle, and her belongings for other contraband, and again found none. She no longer had the buy money.", "Thereafter, the defendant and Taylor emerged from the residence and drove away in a gray BMW. The defendant was driving and Taylor was sitting in the front passenger\u2019s seat. Officers then conducted a motor vehicle stop, took the defendant and Taylor into custody, and transported them to the police station. Trask applied for warrants to search the defendant, Taylor, and the BMW.", "Before the warrants were issued, Taylor identified certain items in the BMW belonging to her, including a green and purple backpack on the front passenger\u2019s side floor, a purse on the front passenger\u2019s seat, and a black backpack in the trunk. She consented to a search of those items as well as her person. Officers found nothing of significance in the backpacks, but in the purse they found crack cocaine pipes, brass knuckles, lighters, scissors, a syringe, a first aid kit, and a digital scale. There was testimony at trial that the buy money was found on the defendant\u2019s person.", "Upon executing a search warrant for the BMW, officers found a black bag under the rear passenger\u2019s seat. The bag\u2019s contents \u2013 including laptop computers with content linked to the defendant, mail addressed to the defendant, and a notebook entitled \u201cMatthew Tabaldi\u2019s usernames and passcodes\u201d \u2013 indicated that the bag belonged to the defendant. Other items in the bag included: a ledger, plastic baggies, a white powder used as a cutting agent to dilute the strength of drugs, a weight for calibrating a scale, and a small torch commonly used for quickly heating drugs. The bag also contained a device police referred to as a \u201ctaser.\u201d Additionally, officers discovered a black case under the driver\u2019s seat, which contained drug paraphernalia, including spoons, plastic tubing, copper mesh, and a hypodermic needle. Officers also discovered a digital scale in the pocket of a canvas guitar bag behind the driver\u2019s seat, crack cocaine pipes in a black canvas bag on the front passenger\u2019s seat, and another crack cocaine pipe in the pocket of a jacket on that seat. Finally, a Newport cigarette box containing crack cocaine was found between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console.", "Officers also executed a search warrant at Vaillancourt\u2019s residence. In the defendant\u2019s bedroom they found, among other things, an open box of plastic sandwich bags and a white powdered substance that later tested positive for cocaine. On August 20, 2009, the defendant met with Trask and Arcieri at the State Police barracks in Epping, and told them that he dealt drugs. During a recorded telephone call with Taylor on October 2, 2011, the defendant discussed the events of March 25 with her saying, \u201cI had to wait for a girl and make a sale.\u201d Taylor responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be hating. Don\u2019t be hating.\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cHating? I\u2019m doing a long time for this.\u201d II. Discussion", "A. Motion to Strike Juror", "During jury selection, the venire was advised that the defendant was a convicted felon. A prospective juror, H.S., thereafter explained to the trial court, \u201c[H]earing that a gentleman in the defendant\u2019s chair is a convicted felon just makes me a little \u2013 somewhat concerned for the charges brought against him.\u201d When asked if she would be able to put her concern aside, the juror indicated, \u201cI will do my best.\u201d The trial court then engaged in the following exchange with H.S.:", "Court: And you\u2019re going to hear about this, but you\u2019re going to", "need to expressly and affirmatively be able to say to me that\u2019s --", "I\u2019m not trying this case on the basis of someone\u2019s reputation or his", "past.", "H.S.: Yes, sir.", "Court: Whether or not the State has proven the case here, beyond", "a reasonable doubt.", "H.S.: Okay.", "Court: So you need to be focused in on the evidence here.", "H.S.: Yes, sir. Okay.", "Court: You can do that?", "H.S.: Yes, sir. Defense counsel moved to strike H.S. for cause on the basis of her \u201creservations.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. H.S. was later stricken following the parties\u2019 use of their peremptory challenges. See RSA 606:3, III (2001); see also RSA 606:4, III (2001).", "The defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike H.S. for cause, and that the error violated his rights to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Articles 15, 17, 21, and 35 of the New Hampshire Constitution. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).", "Part I, Article 35 of the State Constitution provides, \u201cIt is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will admit.\u201d \u201cThis provision for judicial impartiality is applicable as well to jurors.\u201d State v. Town, 163 N.H. 790, 793 (2012). \u201c[I]t is a fundamental precept of our system of justice that a defendant has the right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\u201d Id. at 793-94 (quotation omitted).", "\u201cGenerally, a juror is presumed to be impartial.\u201d Id. at 794. \u201cA juror is considered impartial if the juror can lay aside her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen a juror\u2019s impartiality is questioned, however, the trial court has a duty to determine whether the juror is indifferent.\u201d Id. \u201cIf it appears that any juror is not indifferent, he shall be set aside on that trial.\u201d RSA 500-A:12, II (2010); Town, 163 N.H. at 794. \u201cIndifference or impartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind.\u201d State v. Weir, 138 N.H. 671, 673 (1994) (quotation omitted). The trial court\u2019s determination of the impartiality of the jurors selected is essentially a question of demeanor and credibility and, thus, is entitled to special deference. Id. at 673-74. \u201cWe will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion or a finding that the trial judge\u2019s decision was against the weight of the evidence.\u201d Town, 163 N.H. at 794.", "In Town, we considered an argument similar to that presented here. The defendant in Town was accused of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Id. at 791. A potential juror expressed concerns regarding her ability to be impartial. Id. at 794. The juror revealed that she had been the victim of sexual assault and also stated, \u201cI think I need to do this.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). She then reiterated that she was \u201cnot sure\u201d whether she could be fair and impartial. Id. (quotation omitted). Although the trial court twice asked her if she could put aside her personal circumstances and judge the case based solely upon the evidence presented, each time she merely indicated that she would \u201ctry.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). We reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, concluding that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in finding that the juror was qualified to sit on the jury. Id. at 791, 795. We held that the juror\u2019s \u201cindication that she would \u2018try\u2019 to be fair and impartial, without more, was insufficient to establish that she could lay aside her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d Id. at 794 (quotation omitted).", "This case is similar to Town in that H.S. initially stated that she would \u201cdo her best\u201d to put aside her concerns regarding the defendant\u2019s status as a convicted felon. Here, however, the trial court probed further, asking a number of questions, including whether H.S. would \u201caffirmatively be able to say\u201d that she would \u201cnot try[ ] this case on the basis of someone\u2019s reputation or his past.\u201d H.S. responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d On this record, we conclude that the trial court satisfied its duty to determine whether H.S. was impartial and that the juror\u2019s responses supported the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike H.S. for cause. Having concluded that the trial court did not err when it determined that H.S. was impartial, we need not address the defendant\u2019s arguments based upon his assumption that the juror was not impartial. Because the State Constitution provides at least as much protection as the Federal Constitution on this issue, we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution. See Weir, 138 N.H. at 673.", "B. Sufficiency of the Evidence", "The defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motions to dismiss for insufficient evidence the felon in possession of an electronic defense weapon and possession of crack cocaine charges. \u201cTo prevail upon a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Trebian, 164 N.H. 629, 632 (2013). \u201cWhen the evidence is solely circumstantial, it must exclude all rational conclusions except guilt.\u201d Id. \u201cUnder this standard, however, we still consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and examine each evidentiary item in context, not in isolation.\u201d Id. \u201cThe proper analysis is not whether every possible conclusion consistent with innocence has been excluded, but, rather, whether all such rational conclusions based upon the evidence have been excluded.\u201d Id. We review the entire trial record because the defendant chose to present evidence after the trial court denied his motions to dismiss. See State v. Dion, 164 N.H. 544, 548 (2013). Even though a defendant is not required to present a case, if he chooses to do so, he takes the chance that evidence presented in his case may assist in proving the State\u2019s case. Id.", "1. Felon in Possession", "To convict a defendant of being a felon in possession of an electronic defense weapon, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that: (1) the defendant was a convicted felon; and (2) he possessed \u201can electronic defense weapon away from the premises where he resides.\u201d RSA 159:21. RSA 159:20, I (2002) defines an electronic defense weapon as \u201can electronically activated non-lethal device which is designed for or capable of producing an electrical charge of sufficient magnitude to immobilize or incapacitate a person temporarily.\u201d", "The defendant stipulated at trial that he was a convicted felon. He contends that the evidence was insufficient because the State failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the device found in his possession was \u201cdesigned for or capable of producing an electrical charge of sufficient magnitude to immobilize or incapacitate a person temporarily.\u201d We agree.", "The only evidence at trial regarding the capability of the device was Trask\u2019s testimony. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, Trask testified that, while searching the defendant\u2019s black bag, he found a device that he described as a taser. He then testified:", "Q And that, just so we\u2019re clear, . . . you yourself carry a Taser,", "I imagine?", "A Yes.", "Q As part of your work?", "A Yes.", "Q Okay. That obvious \u2013 what\u2019s in front of us here . . .", "obviously differs from the weapon you carry.", "A Correct.", "Q Okay.

I actually activated it.", "Q What happened when you activated it?", "A When I activated it, there were blue sparks that arched", "between the two electrodes . . . .

And how does it appear to be powered?", "A By a nine-volt battery.", "Q Okay. And this was obviously some time ago that this was", "discovered. As far as you\u2019re aware, is the battery still working or is", "it out?", "A No, it\u2019s dead at this point. The State presented no other evidence to prove the charge.", "This testimony was insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish that the taser Trask discovered was designed for, or capable of, producing the requisite electrical charge. Trask\u2019s testimony that the device was a \u201ctaser\u201d from which he observed \u201csparks\u201d and could hear \u201cthe crackling of electricity,\u201d even when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was insufficient to allow a rational juror to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the device was designed for or capable of the requisite electrical charge. Cf. People v. Racy, 56 Cal. Rptr. 3d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2007) (\u201c[T]he effects of a stun gun, unlike the effects of more typically used weapons such as knives or handguns, are matters beyond the experience of average jurors.\u201d).", "Because the evidence was insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, one of the elements of the charge of felon in possession of an electrical defense weapon, we reverse, with prejudice, the defendant\u2019s conviction on that charge. See Gordon, 161 N.H. at 418.", "2. Possession of Crack Cocaine", "The possession of crack cocaine charge alleged that the defendant knowingly \u201chad in his possession, or under his control, . . . a quantity of the narcotic drug crack cocaine.\u201d To gain a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant: (1) had knowledge of the nature of the drug; (2) had knowledge of its presence in his vicinity; and (3) had custody of the drug and exercised dominion and control over it. State v. Smalley, 148 N.H. 66, 68 (2002). The defendant challenges only the State\u2019s proof that he had custody of the crack cocaine.", "When a drug is not found in a defendant\u2019s physical possession, the State must prove constructive possession. Id. \u201cConstructive possession can be inferred from incriminating statements or circumstances linking the defendant to the drugs, such as personal possessions found near the drugs.\u201d Id. at 69 (quotation omitted). \u201c[C]onstructive possession of drugs need not be exclusive.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).", "The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he constructively possessed the crack cocaine. Specifically, he argues that \u201cthe evidence could have just as likely supported the conclusion that the cigarette box, and thus the crack cocaine, belonged to Taylor.\u201d Thus, he contends, the evidence was insufficient because it failed to exclude all rational conclusions except guilt. See Trebian, 164 N.H. at 632.", "Although the defendant also intimates that the evidence could also have supported a conclusion that the cigarette box belonged to Vaillancourt, he does not develop this argument. Nor does the record establish that he raised this argument in the trial court. Accordingly, we do not consider it.", "We conclude that a rational juror, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant constructively possessed the crack cocaine. The crack cocaine was found in a location over which the defendant could exercise dominion and control. He was the driver of the vehicle; the cigarette box was found between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console. Additionally, several of his possessions were located near the crack cocaine, including his black bag containing drug paraphernalia. \u201c[P]ersonal possessions of the defendant [found] in close proximity to the controlled substance may provide a sufficiently close nexus between the defendant and the substance to allow the jury to infer possession.\u201d Smalley, 148 N.H. at 69 (quotation omitted).", "Although the defendant argues that the crack cocaine could have belonged to Taylor, \u201cthe jury could have drawn reasonable inferences based upon the evidence presented and concluded that [it] belonged to the defendant.\u201d State v.

Howard, 687 F.3d 13, 20\u201321 (1st Cir. 2012) (it was within jury\u2019s prerogative to choose which inference regarding constructive possession was most worthy of belief). The State did not have to establish that the defendant had exclusive constructive possession of the crack cocaine. See Smalley, 148 N.H. at 69.", "Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational juror could have reasonably found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant constructively possessed the crack cocaine.

This out-of-court statement was introduced for the truth of what it asserted \u2013 that, in fact, the buy money was found on the defendant\u2019s person. \u201cIf the purpose of testimony is to use an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of facts stated, the hearsay objection cannot be eliminated by eliciting the content of the statement in an indirect form.\u201d 2 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 249, at 196 (Kenneth S. Broun ed., 7th ed. 2013). \u201cThus, when offered as proof of the facts asserted, testimony regarding \u2018information received\u2019 by the witness and the results of investigations made by other persons are properly classified as hearsay.\u201d Id. at 196-97; see United States v.

The statement was made by someone other than Trask (the testifying declarant) and was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the buy money was found on the defendant).", "The State\u2019s arguments for a contrary conclusion are unpersuasive. The State first asserts that Trask\u2019s testimony was admitted for \u201cthe limited purpose of explaining why Trask had compared the serial numbers on the bills.\u201d This is not supported by the record. Trask never testified that he compared the serial numbers on the bills. He testified only that the money taken from the defendant included the buy money. He never testified about how he determined this to be the case.", "Moreover, the trial court stated that it allowed the testimony to show \u201cthe procedure that [Trask] worked on,\u201d which included \u201cwhere the money came from.\u201d The trial court expressly allowed Trask to testify that someone had \u201crepresented to him\u201d that the buy money came from the defendant. Thus, the \u201cprocedure\u201d about which the trial court allowed Trask to testify included the hearsay statement, admitted for the truth of what it asserted.", "Alternatively, the State contends that because the defendant \u201crefused\u201d the trial court\u2019s offer to give a limiting instruction, \u201che cannot claim that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to do so.\u201d Because the \u201cprocedure\u201d about which the court allowed Trask to testify included the fact that Trask was told that the buy money was found on the defendant, this is one of those rare cases in which a curative instruction, even if it had been given, would not have cured the prejudice. See State v. LaBranche, 118 N.H. 176, 179-80 (1978).", "The State next invokes the invited error doctrine. Under that doctrine, \u201ca party may not avail himself of error into which he has led the trial court.\u201d State v. Bain, 145 N.H. 367, 370 (2000) (quotation omitted). The State contends that on direct examination, Trask merely testified that he \u201cunderstood\u201d that the buy money had been found on the defendant. It was not until cross-examination that Trask testified that someone told him that this was the case. The State asserts that \u201cbecause it was the defendant who elicited the testimony that the money had in fact been taken from him, he cannot now claim that he was prejudiced by that testimony.\u201d The State\u2019s effort to distinguish Trask\u2019s testimony on direct examination from his testimony on cross-examination is unavailing. As discussed previously, Trask\u2019s testimony on both direct and cross-examination constitutes inadmissible hearsay. Trask\u2019s testimony on both direct and cross-examination referred to the same out-of-court statement by another declarant.", "The State argues that even if Trask\u2019s testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay, the error was harmless because there was overwhelming alternative evidence that the defendant sold the cocaine to the CI. We agree.", "\u201cAn error is harmless if we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict.\u201d State v. Beede, 156 N.H. 102, 109 (2007). \u201cThe State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless.\u201d Id. \u201cThe evaluation of whether the State has met its burden involves consideration of the alternative evidence presented at trial and the character of the contested evidence.\u201d Id. \u201cAn error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight, and if the contested evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.\u201d Id.", "We conclude that the State has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant\u2019s conviction for selling cocaine was not affected by admission of Trask\u2019s testimony that the buy money was found on the defendant\u2019s person. The sale of narcotic drug (cocaine) charge alleged that the defendant knowingly \u201csold a quantity of the narcotic drug Cocaine . . . to a cooperating individual working with the New Hampshire State Police.\u201d Accordingly, for the jury to convict the defendant of this charge, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knowingly sold cocaine to the CI.", "The alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on this charge was multi-faceted. Substantial evidence linked him to the controlled buy, which occurred at Vaillancourt\u2019s residence, where the defendant lived. Moreover, the defendant admitted to Taylor that, on March 25, 2009, the day on which the controlled buy occurred, he \u201chad to wait for a girl and make a sale.\u201d From this statement, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the \u201cgirl\u201d to whom he referred was the CI and that the \u201csale\u201d he made on March 25 was the sale of cocaine to the CI. He also told Taylor that he would be \u201cdoing a long time for this.\u201d The two statements in context allowed the jury reasonably to infer that the defendant would be \u201cdoing a long time\u201d for selling cocaine to the CI.", "Additionally, there was substantial evidence that the defendant regularly sold drugs. The defendant admitted to the police that he was involved in drug dealing. Further, when the police searched the defendant\u2019s bedroom, the police found an open box of plastic sandwich bags that \u201cwere indicative of packaging drugs for distribution.\u201d They also found a white powdered substance on the defendant\u2019s desk, which tested positive for cocaine. Moreover, a bag found in the BMW with items indicating that the bag belonged to the defendant also contained a ledger, plastic sandwich bags, a small bag containing a cutting agent, and a weight for calibrating a scale.", "We conclude that, given the extent and nature of the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on this charge, such evidence was overwhelming and that the inadmissible testimony was inconsequential to it. Accordingly, we hold that any error in admitting the challenged testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the defendant contends that admitting Trask\u2019s testimony violated his rights under the State and Federal Confrontation Clauses, our conclusion that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is dispositive of those claims. See State v. Hernandez, 159 N.H. 394, 401-02 (2009) (applying harmless error review to admission of evidence in violation of State and Federal Confrontation Clauses).", "2. Photographs", "The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred when it admitted two photographs that he asserts unfairly prejudiced the jury. One photograph was of the defendant, leaning back in a car seat and holding fanned-out paper currency in his hand. The second is a photograph that the police took of the first photograph tucked into the frame of a mirror, surrounded by photographs of the defendant\u2019s son. The defendant concedes that the second photograph was taken to document the location of the first photograph.", "The defendant contends that both photographs were irrelevant. See N.H. R. Ev. 401, 402. He also argues that even if the photographs were marginally relevant, they were inadmissible under New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b) because their limited probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.", "\u201cWe review challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case.\u201d State v. Brooks, 164 N.H. 272, 283 (2012) (quotation omitted). In determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary decision made. State v. Noucas, 165 N.H. ___, ___ (decided July 16, 2013). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.

R. Ev. 401. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. N.H. R. Ev. 402.", "Here, we conclude that the trial court reasonably determined that the challenged photographs were relevant to demonstrate that the defendant had dominion and control over the room in which the police found the cocaine and incriminating items. Proof of this fact was necessary to prove the possession of cocaine charge. See Trebian, 164 N.H. at 632. The charge alleged that the defendant knowingly \u201chad in his possession, or under his control . . . a quantity of the narcotic drug cocaine.\u201d The cocaine at issue was found in the bedroom.", "To establish that the defendant constructively possessed the cocaine, the State had to prove more than that he and Vaillancourt shared occupancy of Vaillancourt\u2019s home. See State v. Cartier, 133 N.H. 217, 221 (1990); State v. Comeau, 114 N.H. 431, 435 (1974) (evidence sufficient to establish constructive possession of drugs when evidence showed, among other things, that defendant had access to room where marijuana plants were found and kept personal possessions there). Although the defendant contends that the fact that he occupied the bedroom \u201cwas not . . . genuinely disputed,\u201d because he did not stipulate that he knew the cocaine was in his room and that he had custody of and exercised dominion and control over it, the State retained the burden of proving these facts beyond a reasonable doubt. See Trebian, 164 N.H. at 632.", "Under the balancing test common to Rules 403 and 404(b), we examine whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. State v. Marti, 140 N.H. 692, 694 (1996). \u201cUnder both rules, evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). \u201cUnfair prejudice is not, of course, mere detriment to a defendant from the tendency of the evidence to prove guilt, in which sense all evidence offered by the prosecution is meant to be prejudicial.\u201d State v. Nightingale, 160 N.H. 569, 574 (2010). \u201cRather, the prejudice required to predicate reversible error is an undue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis, commonly one that is emotionally charged.\u201d Id. Among the factors we consider in weighing the evidence are: (1) whether the evidence would have a great emotional impact upon a jury; (2) its potential for appealing to a juror\u2019s sense of resentment or outrage; and (3) the extent to which the issue upon which it is offered is established by other evidence, stipulation or inference. Id. at 574-75.", "\u201cThe trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial impact of particular testimony, and what steps, if any, are necessary to remedy that prejudice.\u201d Id. at 575 (quotation omitted). \u201cThus, we give the trial court broad latitude when ruling on the admissibility of potentially unfairly prejudicial evidence.\u201d Id.", "The trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the photographs was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. In the context of this case, we cannot say that a photograph of the defendant holding fanned-out paper currency in his hand was likely to have any greater emotional impact on the jury than the other evidence tending to show that he regularly sold drugs. See id. Although the photograph \u201cmay have been prejudicial, we cannot conclude that [it] was so inflammatory as to substantially outweigh its probative value.\u201d Id.

The police accompanied the friend to the defendant\u2019s home. The friend entered the home, spoke briefly with the defendant, gave him $400, and returned to the police with the two handguns. He was searched again after giving the guns to the police and was not found to have any contraband.

Throughout the trial, witnesses, including the defendant, referred to the handguns as \u201cfirearms.\u201d At the trial\u2019s conclusion, the jury was instructed that, to convict the defendant, it had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that: (1) he \u201creceived, retained, and/or disposed of property\u201d; (2) \u201cthe property belonged to another person\u201d; (3) he \u201cknew the property had been stolen or believed that . . . it had probably been stolen\u201d; and (4) he \u201creceived the property with the purpose to deprive the owner of the property.\u201d The defendant did not object to those instructions. After the jury convicted the defendant, the trial court sentenced him to the New Hampshire State Prison for a minimum of three years and a maximum of six years, stand committed. The defendant did not object to the sentence.", "On appeal, however, the defendant argues that his sentence violates Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution because, for him to receive a felony-level sentence, the jury must have been instructed to find, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the stolen property consisted of firearms. See RSA 637:11, I(b) (receipt of stolen property constitutes a class A felony when \u201c[t]he property stolen is a firearm\u201d). Because the defendant did not make that argument in the trial court, he invokes the plain error rule, which allows us, under certain narrowly drawn circumstances, to correct errors not raised in the trial court. See Sup. Ct. R. 16-A.", "For us to find plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. State v. Charest, 164 N.H. 252, 254 (2012).

Id. The rule is used sparingly, however, and is limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. Id. We assume, without deciding, that the first three prongs of the plain error test are met. See State v. Russell, 159 N.H. 475, 490-94 (2009). We, therefore, confine our review to the fourth prong of the plain error test.", "We find Russell instructive. The defendant in Russell, 159 N.H. at 490, was sentenced under RSA 651:2, II-g (Supp. 2013), which provides for an enhanced sentence \u201c[i]f a person is convicted of a felony, an element of which is the possession, use or attempted use of a deadly weapon, and the deadly weapon is a firearm.\u201d The trial court had instructed the jury that to convict the defendant of armed robbery, it had to find that he was armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). However, the court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d with which the defendant was armed was a firearm. Id. Instead, the trial court defined a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as \u201cany firearm, knife or anything else which is used in such a way that the defendant knew or should have known that it could result in death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). At trial, there was evidence that the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d used could have been a BB gun. Id. at 492. The defendant argued that, based upon the jury instructions and evidence presented at trial, the jury could have convicted him of armed robbery with a BB gun. Id. at 489. Accordingly, he contended that because the trial court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d he used in the armed robbery was a firearm, his sentence under RSA 651:2, II-g was unconstitutional. Id.", "Because the defendant in Russell failed to object to the jury instructions and to his sentence, we reviewed his sentence under the plain error rule. Id. at 489. Although we agreed with the State\u2019s concession that the trial court erred and that the error was plain, id. at 490, we concluded that the fourth prong of the plain error test was not met because evidence that the defendant used a firearm was overwhelming and undisputed, id. at 491-93. We explained that although a witness testified \u201cthat he initially thought that the shooter had a BB gun . . . , he also testified that the defendant pointed a gun at [the victim].\u201d Id. at 492. The witness stated that the gun looked like a revolver and that a BB gun would not have done as much damage to the window of the car in which the victim was seated. Id. Moreover, the victim testified that someone \u201chad stuck a gun inside [the] vehicle and shot out its back window.\u201d Id.

In addition, at trial, the defendant in Russell did not dispute that the deadly weapon used during the robbery was a firearm.

Id.", "Similarly, here, evidence that the stolen property at issue consisted of handguns was overwhelming. The evidence at trial concerned only handguns as stolen property; no other allegedly stolen property was discussed. Additionally, the defendant did not dispute at trial, and does not dispute on appeal, that a handgun is a firearm. See id. At trial, witnesses, including the defendant, referred to the stolen handguns as \u201cfirearms.\u201d In this case, as in others involving the issue of whether a handgun is a \u201cfirearm,\u201d based upon the evidence at trial, \u201cthere was no real issue as to whether the handgun was a firearm.\u201d State v. Taylor, 136 N.H. 131, 134 (1992); see State v. St. John, 129 N.H. 1, 3-4 (1986) (when defendant was charged with possessing a .357 Dan Wesson handgun and witnesses referred to the handgun as a \u201cfirearm\u201d at trial, there was no need for trial court to instruct jury that a firearm is \u201ca weapon from which shot is discharged by gunpowder\u201d (quotation omitted)). Accordingly, as in Russell, we will not exercise our discretion under the fourth prong of the plain error rule to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence. See Russell, 159 N.H. at 492. Given the essentially uncontroverted evidence that the stolen property consisted of handguns and that the handguns constitute firearms, \u201cthe real threat then to the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings would be if the defendant, despite th[at] . . . uncontroverted evidence . . . , were not to receive the enhanced sentence.\u201d Id.

Id. at 494. The defendant asks us to overrule that part of Russell. He asks that we hold \u201cthat, where the jury has not been instructed to find a sentencing enhancement element, sentencing based on that enhancement is plain error, satisfying all four elements of the plain error test.\u201d", "Generally, we will overrule a prior decision only after considering:", "(1) whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply by defying", "practical workability; (2) whether the rule is subject to a kind of", "reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequence of", "overruling; (3) whether related principles of law have so far", "developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of", "abandoned doctrine; and (4) whether facts have so changed, or", "come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of", "significant application or justification. Maplevale Builders v. Town of Danville, 165 N.H. 99, 105 (2013) (quotation omitted). The defendant argues only that Russell is \u201cintolerable,\u201d but not because it \u201cdef[ies] practical workability.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). The defendant asserts that Russell is intolerable because: (1) it treats defendants who have preserved their objections to jury instructions and sentencing differently from those who have not; (2) it conflicts with prior and subsequent cases; and (3) it undermines \u201csignificant constitutional guarantees.\u201d In effect, the defendant finds Russell to be intolerable because he believes that it was incorrectly decided. However, \u201c[p]rincipled application of stare decisis requires a court to adhere . . . to . . . precedent in the absence of some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). Having failed to brief the four stare decisis factors, the defendant has not persuaded us that Russell must be overruled. See id.", "Affirmed.", "HICKS, CONBOY and BASSETT, JJ., concurred; LYNN, J., concurred specially.", "LYNN, J., concurring specially. Because my view as to the factors that may warrant overruling precedent is broader than that of the majority, see State v. Quintero, 162 N.H. 526, 543-47 (2011) (Lynn, J., concurring specially), I arguably would be more willing than the majority to overrule State v. Russell, 159 N.H. 475 (2009), if I thought that case had been wrongly decided. But I do not believe Russell was wrongly decided; and insofar as the defendant argues that Russell is fundamentally at odds with our decision in State v. Kousounadis, 159 N.H. 413 (2009), I tend to believe that it is Kousounadis, not Russell, that is ripe for reexamination.
